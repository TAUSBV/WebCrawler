What is a coronavirus?

An artist's depiction of the 2019-nCov novel coronavirus. Coronaviruses get their name for the spikey projections on their surface that resemble the prongs of a crown.
Coronaviruses make up a large family of viruses that can infect birds and mammals, including humans, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 
These viruses have been responsible for several outbreaks around the world, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2002-2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea in 2015. Most recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19) triggered an outbreak in China in December 2019, sparking international concern. 
While some coronaviruses have caused devastating epidemics, others cause mild to moderate respiratory infections, like the common cold.

All coronaviruses sport spiky projections on their outer surfaces that resemble the points of a crown, or "corona" in Latin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Seven known coronaviruses can infect humans, including the novel coronavirus identified in 2019. 
Beneath a coronavirus's pronged exterior lies a round core shrouded in proteins and a "greasy" membrane, Jan Carette, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, told Live Science in an email. The core contains genetic material that the virus can inject into vulnerable cells to infect them. So-called spike proteins extend from within the core to the viral surface and allow the virus to "recognize and latch onto" specific cells in the body, Carette said. 
"When the spike engages its receptor [on a host cell], a cascade is triggered, resulting in the merger of the virus with the cell," he added. This merger allows the virus to release its genetic material and hijack the cell's internal machinery. "Once this happens, the virus sheds its coat and turns the cell into a factory that starts churning out new viruses."

Several coronaviruses utilize animals as their primary hosts and have evolved to infect humans, too. Precursors to both SARS and MERS coronaviruses appear in bats. The SARS virus jumped from bats to civets (small, nocturnal mammals) on its way into people, while MERS infected camels before spreading to humans. Evidence suggests that the novel coronavirus also jumped from bats to humans after passing through an intermediate carrier, although scientists have not yet identified the infectious middleman creature.
The four most common human coronaviruses — named 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 — did not jump from animals to humans but rather utilize humans as their natural hosts, according to the CDC. These human-borne coronaviruses "have presumably evolved to maximize spread amongst the population rather than pathogenicity," meaning the viruses may opt to maximize their spread rather than harm their human host, Carette said. This may explain why coronaviruses that are transmitted from animals seem to cause more-severe diseases in humans, but the idea remains speculative, he added.
Coronaviruses can be transmitted between humans through respiratory droplets that infected people expel when they breathe, cough or sneeze. A typical surgical mask cannot block out the viral particles contained in these droplets, but simple measures — such as washing your hands, disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and objects, and avoiding touching your face, eyes and mouth — can greatly lower your risk of infection.
The viruses generally cannot survive for more than a few hours on surfaces outside a human host, but people can pick up a coronavirus from a contaminated surface for a short window of time, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a CDC news conference in early 2020. Scientists don't yet know how long the novel coronavirus can survive outside a host.
Symptoms
In humans, coronaviruses typically cause a respiratory infection with mild to severe flu-like symptoms, but the exact symptoms vary depending on the type of coronavirus. 
The four common human coronaviruses can cause people to develop a runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat and fever, according to the CDC. In a subset of individuals, including those with cardiopulmonary disease or a weakened immune system, the viral infection can progress to a more severe lower-respiratory infection such as pneumonia or bronchitis.

In comparison, severe MERS and SARS infections often progress to pneumonia. Other symptoms of MERS include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, while SARS can cause fever, chills and body aches. SARS had a mortality rate of 9.6% in the early 2000s outbreaks, according to The New York Times, while MERS has an estimated mortality rate between 30% and 40%, the CDC noted. 
The novel coronavirus causes symptoms similar to those of other coronaviruses, triggering fever, cough and difficulty breathing in most patients. Rarer symptoms include dizziness, nausea, vomiting and a runny nose. As of February 2020, scientists estimate the SARS-CoV-2 mortality rate at 2%, although that figure may be somewhat skewed by the severity of the cases studied so far. As more mild cases of the infection are accounted for, the estimated mortality rate may fall.

Doctors can test their patients for coronavirus infections by analyzing respiratory specimens and serum isolated from their blood, according to the CDC. The CDC has developed an equivalent diagnostic test for the novel coronavirus, but its accuracy and specificity for the virus are still being verified. Once confirmed, diagnostic kits will be distributed to health care facilities in the U.S. and abroad, according to a CDC news conference in January 2020.
There are no available treatments for any human coronavirus, according to the CDC. Those who catch a common coronavirus usually recover on their own and can ease the process by taking pain and fever medications, using a humidifier, taking hot showers, drinking plenty of fluids and staying home to rest. Similar regimens are used to relieve the symptoms of more severe coronavirus infections.
Several existing antiviral medications, originally intended to treat Ebola and malaria, may show some efficacy against the novel coronavirus, Live Science previously reported. These medications disable viruses by interfering with their attempts to replicate in host cells. Another class of drug, called "protease inhibitors," also shows promise against coronaviruses and helps to alert the immune system to viral invaders. 
As of February 2020, no federally approved vaccines exist to prevent coronavirus infections. 
Scientists developed a candidate vaccine for SARS during the pandemic of that virus, and a potential MERS vaccine recently performed well in preliminary clinical trials, but neither of these has hit the market. Research groups around the world are now racing to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus; the CDC aims to have such a vaccine ready for clinical trials within three months. If and when a vaccine is developed, however, health officials will have to evaluate how the outbreak has evolved before conducting further tests and eventually administering the vaccine.

How does the new coronavirus spread?
Here's how you could catch COVID-19.
The new coronavirus spreads mainly through respiratory droplets that launch into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 appears to be fairly easily spread. But the good news is that it's not among the most transmissible diseases out there.
The new coronavirus spreads mostly through person-to-person contact within about a 6-foot (1.8 meters) radius, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). People with COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus, spread viral particles through coughing and sneezing. The particles can land in the mouths or noses of those nearby. 
It might also be possible to catch SARS-CoV-2 by touching a surface where the virus has recently landed and then touching one's mouth, nose or eyes, but CDC officials believe this method of transmission is less common. Some coronaviruses can live on surfaces for days, but not much is known about the new coronavirus' ability to survive on surfaces. Fortunately, ethanol, hydrogen-peroxide or bleach-based cleaners are effective at killing those coronaviruses that do survive on surfaces.

Unlike some extremely contagious pathogens, the virus is not thought to spread via smaller droplets that can remain airborne for long periods of time. Measles, for example, can live in the air for hours after an infected person coughs or sneezes. This is not currently believed to be the case for SARS-CoV-2. 
There is limited evidence that the new coronavirus can spread through feces as well. A small study of the stool samples of those diagnosed with COVID-19 found that viral particles in those stools looked viable under a microscope. "This means that stool samples may contaminate hands, food, water, etc.," the China CDC wrote in the report. For instance, if a person didn't wash their hands after touching a surface contaminated with infected stool residue, there's a chance they could become infected if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands, Live Science previously reported.
To avoid catching the new coronavirus, health officials recommend avoiding close contact with people who are sick. Face masks are not effective protection for people who are well, but people who are already ill can wear them to reduce the likelihood that they'll cough or sneeze droplets on loved ones. A face mask is not a substitute for staying home when you're sick, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, told Live Science.
The CDC also recommends avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Frequent hand-washing — 20 seconds, with soap and water — and 60%-95% alcohol-based hand sanitizers can kill the virus.
Coronavirus basics
The novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2, causes the disease COVID-19. The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31, 2019. Since then, it has spread to every continent except Antarctica. The death rate appears to be higher than that of the seasonal flu, but it also varies by location as well as a person's age, underlying health conditions, among other factors. For instance, in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, the death rate reached 2.9%, whereas it was just 0.4% in other provinces in China, according to a study published Feb. 18 in the China CDC Weekly.
Scientists aren't certain where the virus originated, though they know that coronaviruses (which also include SARS and MERS) are passed between animals and humans. Research comparing the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with a viral database suggests it originated in bats. Since no bats were sold at the seafood market in Wuhan at the disease’s epicenter, researchers suggest an intermediate animal, possibly the pangolin (an endangered mammal) is responsible for the transmission to humans. There are currently no treatments for the disease, but labs are working on various types of treatments, including a vaccine.

Coronavirus in U.S.
States aren’t testing uniformly for coronavirus. That’s creating a distorted picture of the outbreak.
A member of the health care staff from the Community Health of South Florida, Inc. prepares to test people for the novel coronavirus on March 18, 2020 in Miami, Florida. Testing availability varies widely across the U.S., making it difficult to get ahead of outbreaks.
The United States has surpassed the rest of the world in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 85,762, as of today (March 27). That came as no surprise to most experts, as it took seven weeks after the first case of the disease was identified in the U.S. for the country to start testing en masse — plenty of time for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread, undetected. 
Now, 10 weeks after the country's first case, testing in the U.S. is beginning to ramp up significantly, but not uniformly. As of Thursday (March 26), 20 states were only up to a testing rate of 1 per 1,000 people. And six states had tested fewer than 1,000 people. That means it's difficult to know, based on reported numbers alone, how widely the coronavirus is circulating in a given state or community.
"The problem is we haven't had enough tests," said Steffanie Strathdee, the associate dean of Global Health Sciences at the University of California San Diego's Department of Medicine and author of "The Perfect Predator" (Hachette Books, 2019). "There's not even enough tests to test the people who are sick." 
Nearly half of all known U.S. coronavirus cases are in New York, which has reported more than 38,977 cases. As of March 26, the state had recorded 103,479 tests, according to The COVID Tracking Project, a nationwide dataset managed by volunteer analysts and journalists. With a population of 19.4 million, that's a testing rate of around 5 tests per 1,000 people, which is the highest testing rate in the country.
Washington state is a distant second, having recorded 34,292 tests for the state's population of about 7.8 million. That's a rate of 4 tests per 1,000 people. In third place is New Mexico, which has run only about 7,800 tests, but that's a rate of 4 tests per 1,000 people (the state's population is just over 2 million).
The two most populous states in the U.S. are California and Texas, with 39 million and 29 million people, respectively. So far, California is testing at a rate of 2 tests per 1,000 residents, but about 57,400 tests are still waiting on results, according to the state's Department of Public Health. Texas is testing at a rate of only 1 test per 1,000 people.
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 got off to a rough start in the U.S. On Feb. 5, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 to about 100 public-health laboratories across the country. Most of the labs received faulty kits, which meant testing had to continue exclusively at CDC headquarters until the agency could develop and send out replacement kits. 
On Feb. 29, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner announced that the agency would allow local public health and commercial labs to develop and use their own tests for the novel coronavirus. So, now we have a mix of public health labs and commercial labs testing across the country. 
Some states have better public health laboratories than others, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an epidemiologist at the University of California Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health. New York, for example, has some of the best public health institutions in the country. But labs in other parts of the country are far less equipped. "Public-health laboratories were never really capacitated to be on the front lines of a large disease outbreak," Klausner told Live Science. 
Many states are depending on commercial laboratories to help run the tests, but so far, those labs seem unable to pivot from their normal testing routines, Klausner said. "There are huge delays in commercial labs," he said. "I have patients that have been waiting for over 10 days now. That's not helpful for patient care or public health."
Klausner and his colleagues in Los Angeles were so frustrated and tired of waiting on testing results in their area that they created a new commercial laboratory themselves in just eight days. They're now running over 500 tests a day, and have the capacity to scale up exponentially. "These kinds of high-capacity, high-throughput laboratories need to be replicated in high outbreak areas," he said.
The attitude and priority placed on testing also seems to differ between state governments, Strathdee said. This might be because there are mixed messages coming from the federal level. Not long ago, President Trump downplayed the threat of the novel coronavirus, assuring Americans it was nothing to worry about. "Governors might be using that as an excuse, and they might be in rural states that aren't yet seeing a huge deluge of cases," Strathdee told Live Science. "The 'not here, not us' attitude is prevalent."

"Testing and case identification is critical both for patient care and public health to control these local outbreaks," Klausner said. There are other ways to measure an outbreak, such as the number of doctor visits, emergency room visits and admission to the hospital, he said. That's enough to tell epidemiologists that the outbreaks are geographically limited. But the lack of testing has left states unable to implement a strategic approach to containing the outbreaks. "So politicians have had to resort to these massive statewide shutdowns that would not be happening if there was more testing capacity," he said. 
In a perfect world, doctors find out who is infected early on, then isolate those patients and trace their contacts and test them, too. But the U.S. isn't anywhere close to being able to do that right now, Strathdee said. Other places, like South Korea and Canada, have done a much better job at this, she said. Health professionals in those countries can use what's called the ring method, where they essentially draw a ring around cases and test everyone inside the ring and figure out who needs to be isolated. Probably the closest the U.S. has come to this was in New Rochelle, New York, where about 1,000 people were asked to self-quarantine after they were traced back to a lawyer in the community who had COVID-19. It's still too soon to tell, but early data suggests that strategy blunted the disease spread, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in his daily briefing on Wednesday (March 25).
In the U.S., testing data isn't being collated by a government agency. Instead, it's been up to volunteer citizens to create open-source platforms like The COVID-19 Tracker Project, to track the data. It's an amazing effort, Strathdee said, but nobody really knows how complete or accurate the data are. 
What is clear, though, is that the number of known cases in the U.S. continues to grow at an exponential rate, with no sign of slowing down, she said. Having more testing data will help make decisions once infection rates have slowed and the ring method can be used effectively, but it probably won't help right now.

Coronavirus could be catastrophic for great apes, experts warn
The coronavirus, having now traveled the globe and claimed over 23,500 human lives, might also pose a threat to great apes, experts warned.
It's known that "transmission of even mild human pathogens to apes can lead to moderate-to-severe outcomes," conservation experts from the Great Ape Health Consortium wrote in a letter published Tuesday (March 24) in the journal Nature.
Related: 13 coronavirus myths busted by science
It's not known, however, whether the coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, will affect apes as it does humans. "As leading experts in the conservation and health of these animals, we urge governments, conservation practitioners, researchers, tourism professionals and funding agencies to reduce the risk of introducing the virus into these endangered apes," the experts wrote.
Though it's not yet clear, "at this point, it is safest to assume that great apes are susceptible to SARS CoV-2 infection," representatives of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission Health Specialist Group and the Primate Specialist Group wrote in a statement. "It is strongly recommended that great ape visitations by humans are reduced to the minimum."
People can reduce the risk of transmitting the novel coronavirus to great apes by adhering to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's book called the "Best-Practice Guidelines for Health Monitoring and Disease Control in Great Ape Populations," the experts wrote in the letter.
Some of these recommendations include wearing clean clothing and disinfecting footwear before going anywhere near the animals. Transmission can also be reduced by requiring face masks be worn by anyone coming within 10 meters (33 feet) of the animals.

US is new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic
The U.S. is now the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The coronavirus outbreak reached a somber milestone in the U.S. on Thursday (March 26) — the nation now has more coronavirus cases than any other country in the world.
There are now at least 82,174 cases of the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, in the United States, according to worldometer, a website that tracks coronavirus cases. That's higher than the case count in either Italy (which has  80,589 cases) or China (which has 81,285 cases).
Nearly half of all U.S. coronavirus cases are in New York, which has reported more than 37,700 cases.
Just a few days ago, the World Health Organization warned that the U.S. had the potential to become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent weeks — at the beginning of March, the county had reported only about 100 cases total, according to worldometer.
Coronavirus cases in China, where the outbreak began, initially increased rapidly, but leveled off after about Feb. 20.

First US infant death linked to COVID-19 reported in Illinois
The first infant death related to COVID-19 in the United States has been reported in the Chicago area today (March 28). 
"There has never before been a death associated with COVID-19 in an infant," said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the director of the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). "A full investigation is underway to determine the cause of death. We must do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. If not to protect ourselves, but to protect those around us."
The age of the infant, who lived in Cooke County, has not been released. This isn't the first death in an infant confirmed to have COVID-19. In China, a 10-month-old with the disease, died 4 weeks after being admitted to the Wuhan Children's Hospital, according to a March 18 report published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Related: 13 Coronavirus myths busted by science
Though as the pandemic unfolds, doctors are realizing that no age group is immune to the virus nor to its severe health effects, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus still appears to be more severe in older adults.
More than 85% of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois have been in patients aged 60 and older. And across the U.S., even though 31% of confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred in adults ages 65 and older, this age group represents 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of admissions to the ICU and 80% of the deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on March 26.
Currently, Illinois has confirmed 3,491 COVID-19 cases and 47 related deaths in 43 counties. The ages of those infected, range from younger than 1 to 99 years, the IDPH reported.

Loss of smell could be a symptom of COVID-19
Losing your sense of smell could be a sign of COVID-19, even if you have no other symptoms.
Sudden loss of a sense of smell could be a sign of a COVID-19 infection, doctors recently reported.
The complete loss of smell, or anosmia, is already associated with viruses; about 40% of anosmia cases occur after a viral infection, according to a statement published online on March 21 by ENT UK at The Royal College of Surgeons of England, an association of ear, nose and throat physicians in the United Kingdom. 
However, a growing body of data from COVID-19 patients in several countries strongly suggests that "significant numbers" of those patients experienced anosmia as one of the disease's symptoms, according to the ENT UK statement. 
Anecdotal evidence further describes the loss of smell and the loss of taste — known as dysgeusia — in people who had no other symptoms but who tested positive for COVID-19, representatives of the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO–HNS) in Alexandria, Virginia, said in a March 22 statement.
Related: Coronavirus outbreak: Live updates
Doctors with AAO–HNS recommended in the statement that loss of taste and smell be added to the list of symptoms when screening for signs of COVID-19, particularly when these sensory losses are isolated — that is, not accompanied by any signs of respiratory illness.
Such cases of isolated anosmia have been reported in Iran, the U.S., France and northern Italy, according to the ENT UK statement. Dr. Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, said in the statement that she had personally examined four patients during the past week, all under the age of 40, who exhibited no symptoms other than the sudden loss of smell.
"I think these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19," Hopkins said.
When doctors at the University Hospital Bonn in Germany recently interviewed more than 100 patients infected with COVID-19, they discovered that nearly 70% "described a loss of smell and taste lasting several days," said Dr. Hendrik Streeck, head of the hospital's Institute of Virology. 
Though the doctors could not say for sure when the loss of smell and taste first appeared in these patients, they suspect that the symptoms manifested as a later stage of the infection, Streeck added.
If people who have anosmia but no other symptoms were to self-isolate for seven days, "we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors," according to the ENT UK statement.

Why is Germany's COVID-1 death rate so much lower than other countries?
A man walks at the Marienplatz square in Munich, Germany, normally a magnet for tourists, on March 21, 2020, the first day of a dawn-to-dusk curfew in Bavaria during the coronavirus pandemic.
Germany has confirmed nearly 34,000 cases of COVID-19 as of Tuesday morning (March 25), but just 171 deaths total. That number — about a 0.5% death rate — suggests the death rate of the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 is way, way lower in Germany than it is in other countries, such as France, where about 4.3% of cases have ended in death or the United States with a 1.3% mortality rate from the coronavirus. 
Why does Germany seem to be spared lethal cases of the new coronavirus? Early in the infection spread, Germany began to try to test and quarantine all of those who tested positive, at a time when numbers weren't overwhelming, The Washington Post reported. 
"At the beginning, when we had relatively few cases, when it came to finding them and isolating them, we did quite well in Germany," Reinhard Busse, head of the department of health care management at the Berlin University of Technology, told the Post. "That's the major reason."
Related: Coronavirus in the US: Map & cases 
Some epidemiologists told the Journal that high testing rates in Germany might partly explain the lower death rate, as more testing would catch even the mildest cases. However, Germany didn't do mass testing at the highest rates — as was seen in South Korea where 10,000 tests were run a day — but Germany was meticulous about the process, the Post reported. Once an individual tested positive, officials then tracked every one of their contacts and proceeded to test and quarantine those individuals, essentially breaking "infection chains," the Post reported.
In addition, the virus is known to have more severe impacts on the elderly, and to date, most of the diagnosed cases in Germany are in younger individuals: The median age for confirmed cases of COVID-19 is 47 in Germany, compared with 63 years old in Italy (where the death rate from the coronavirus is the highest globally, at 9.5%), according to the Robert Koch Institute, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. (The median means half of the individuals are above and half are below that number.)

In the United States, about 8 in 10 of the coronavirus-related deaths have been in individuals 65 and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And a study published online March 18 found that the majority of COVID-19 deaths in China were in the age group 60 and over.

Don't wear facemasks, little people. We, medical people, want them for ourselves!
Oh, you missed the most significant reason...treatment for the sick. Early on in the spread in Italy, they recognized the need for ventilators to treat the severe pneumonia cases and requested help from their European Union neighbor, Germany. Germany refused. So, the high death rate in Italy has a lot to due with the fact that there are more...
I've been very fascinated by this question myself. I'm not sure either the article or the respirator issue really explains it. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ When you look at stats there, Germany is listed as having almost no serious cases. So it's not that they have serious cases and people are saved by medical technology. It's that they're not having as many...
Isn't it possible that Germany's death rate for covid 19 is simply more accurate than Italy's or the US's? Italy freely admits that their reported number of cases is likely 10X higher than what they reported. If that's the case, Italy's death rate would be only 1%, not 10%. Could it be, because of more disciplined testing, that Germany...

COVID-19 spread is fueled by 'stealth transmission'
Cases of COVID-19 that fly under the radar — without being diagnosed — appear to fuel the rapid spread of the disease.
Cases of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that fly under the radar — without being detected or diagnosed — may have fueled the rapid spread of the disease, according to a new study.
The study found that people with COVID-19 who didn't get diagnosed, likely because they didn't feel very sick, were the source of at least two-thirds of documented COVID-19 cases in China in the early days of the outbreak.
"The explosion of COVID-19 cases in China was largely driven by individuals with mild, limited, or no symptoms who went undetected," study co-author Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said in a statement.
"Undetected cases can expose a far greater portion of the population to [the] virus than would otherwise occur. … These 'stealth transmissions' will continue to present a major challenge to the containment of this outbreak going forward," Shaman said.
Related: What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus?
For the study, published Monday (March 16) in the journal Science, the researchers developed a computer model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among 375 cities in China, including Wuhan, where the outbreak began. For the model, they combined data on reported infections with information on people's movements (obtained from mobile phone data).
They estimated that, prior to the lockdown of Wuhan on Jan. 23, about 86% of all COVID-19 infections in China were undetected. In other words, for every confirmed case of COVID-19, there were six undetected cases, according to The Washington Post. These undetected cases were responsible for the majority of the disease spread prior to the lockdown, the researchers said.
The findings have implications for COVID-19 spread in the rest of the world, as many countries are behind on testing for the disease. The results suggest that the number of cases worldwide could be five to 10 times higher than what has been reported, meaning the true number of cases could be higher than 1.5 million, according to Quartz.

After China implemented the lockdown on Wuhan, officials were able to detect the majority of cases, 65%, and reduce the spread of the disease.
The findings suggest "a radical increase in the identification and isolation of currently undocumented infections would be needed to fully control SARS-CoV-2," the authors concluded.

Editor's note: Here's a look at all the drugs that are being tested for COVID-19 treatment.
COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, has spread to every continent except Antarctica. Not too long after the virus was first discovered at the end of December, labs turned their sights toward treatment.
Currently, however, there is no cure for this coronavirus, and treatments are based on the kind of care given for influenza (seasonal flu) and other severe respiratory illnesses, known as "supportive care," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These treatments essentially treat the symptoms, which often in the case of COVID-19 involve fever, cough and shortness of breath. In mild cases, this might simply mean rest and fever-reducing medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) for comfort.
In hospitals, doctors and nurses are sometimes treating COVID-19 patients with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, which seems to suppress the virus' reproduction in at least some cases. This is somewhat surprising, Michigan Tech virologist Ebenezer Tumban told Live Science, as Tamiflu was designed to target an enzyme on the influenza virus, not on coronaviruses. The National Institutes of Health has begun a clinical trial at the University of Nebraska Medical Center to test the antiviral remdesivir for COVID-19, the agency announced Feb. 25. In China, doctors are also testing an array of other antivirals originally designed to treat Ebola and HIV, Nature Biotechnology reported.
In cases in which pneumonia inhibits breathing, treatment involves ventilation with oxygen. Ventilators blow air into the lungs through a mask or a tube inserted directly into the windpipe. A New England Journal of Medicine study of 1,099 hospitalized patients with the coronavirus in China found that 41.3% needed supplemental oxygen and 2.3% needed invasive mechanical ventilation. Glucocorticoids were given to 18.6% of patients, a treatment often used to reduce inflammation and help open airways during respiratory disease.
There is no vaccine for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Scientists are working to develop one, Hilary Marston, a medical officer and policy advisor at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said in a Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health webcast on Monday (March 2). 
As of March 14, doctors in Seattle are recruiting volunteers to participate in a clinical trial for an experimental vaccine for COVID-19 that's being developed by the biotechnology company Moderna Therapeutics. However, biomedical ethicists are concerned that a critical step in vaccine development was skipped. In order to fast-track the vaccine, the researchers didn’t first show that it triggered an immune response in animals, a step that is normally required before human testing, Live Science previously reported.
The researchers did begin testing the experimental vaccine on lab mice on the same day they started recruiting people for the clinical trial, Stat News reported. The mice did show an immune response that was similar to the one triggered by an experimental vaccine for a related coronavirus MERS-CoV. (Vaccines work by priming your immune system to recognize a virus like SARS-CoV-2 as an enemy and put up an attack against it.)
Related: How this experimental vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 would work
Even so, doctors aren't sure how much this "fast-tracking" will speed up the time it takes to develop and bring such a vaccine to market. 
Before this experimental vaccine was in the works, Marston had said not to expect a vaccine in the near term. "If everything moves as quickly as possible, the soonest that it could possibly be is about one-and-a-half to two years. That still might be very optimistic," Marston said. 
Coronavirus basics
The novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2, causes the disease COVID-19. The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31, 2019, though it seems to have been spreading well before that date. Since then, it has spread to every continent except Antarctica. The death rate appears to be higher than that of the seasonal flu, but it also varies by location as well as a person's age, underlying health conditions, among other factors. For instance, in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, the death rate reached 2.9%, whereas it was just 0.4% in other provinces in China, according to a study published Feb. 18 in the China CDC Weekly.
Scientists aren't certain where the virus originated, though they know that coronaviruses (which also include SARS and MERS) are passed between animals and humans. Research comparing the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with a viral database suggests it originated in bats. Since no bats were sold at the seafood market in Wuhan at the disease’s epicenter, researchers suggest an intermediate animal, possibly the pangolin (an endangered mammal) is responsible for the transmission to humans. There are currently no treatments for the disease, but labs are working on various types of treatments, including a vaccine.

Editor's note: This article was originally published on March 3 and reported the first known case of human-to-animal transmission of the novel coronavirus. The article was updated on March 18 to reflect the animal's death. 
A pet dog that contracted a "low-level" COVID-19 infection from its owner has now died, according to news reports. The owner has not allowed the dog to be autopsied, so the exact cause of death remains unknown.
The 17-year-old Pomeranian first tested "weak positive" for the virus on February 28, and experts from the University of Hong Kong, City University and the World Organisation for Animal Health "unanimously agreed" that the test results reflected a plausible case of human-to-animal transmission, according to a South China Morning Post report published March 4. 
The dog was quarantined at a government facility from February 26 to March 14, after it finally tested negative for the virus and was allowed to return home, the South China Morning Post reported March 18. The animal died on March 16, the dog's owner told the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). 
The dog's owner, a 60-year-old woman, first tested positive for COVID-19 on Feb. 25 and was hospitalized at the time, according to the news report. She returned home on March 8 after recovering from the illness. The genetic makeup of the virus found in people and the virus found in the woman's Pomeranian appeared similar, the AFCD reported. "The [gene] sequence results indicate that the virus likely spread from the infected persons and subsequently infected the dog," they noted in a statement.
So, should the public worry about picking up SARS-CoV-2 from their beloved pets, or their furry companions falling ill? Experts still say no. 
The dog of a Covid-19 patient in Hong Kong has tested “weak-positive” for the #coronavirus, but officials say there is no evidence pets can spread the infection https://t.co/DK8ShrWbyR pic.twitter.com/WMQRkoMXduMarch 5, 2020
The AFCD reported that there is no evidence that dogs could be a source of COVID-19 infection for humans, or that the animals themselves can become sick after contracting the virus, according to the South China Morning Post. Notably, the infected Pomeranian did not fall ill or show any symptoms of disease, the report noted.
Dogs and cats also contracted low-level infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 outbreak, animal health expert Vanessa Barrs from City University told the South China Morning Post. 
"Previous experience with SARS suggests that cats and dogs will not become sick or transmit the virus to humans. At that time, a small number of pets tested positive but none became sick," she said. "Importantly, there was no evidence of viral transmission from pet dogs or cats to humans," Barrs added.
Initially, one respiratory medicine expert, David Hui Shu-cheong of Chinese University, cast doubt on the dog's diagnosis because the animal had not received a serological test — a blood test to determine what antibodies were present in its blood, he told the Post. "If the blood test result is negative," meaning antibodies generated to fight off the virus are not present, "it means the dog is not infected," he said. The Pomeranian received a serological test on March 3 which came back negative for coronavirus-specific antibodies, but that does not mean its diagnosis was wrong, the AFCD noted.
"It is known in some asymptomatic or mild cases of human infections with other types of coronavirus that antibodies may not always develop," the AFCD noted in a statement. In other words, the dog's mild immune response may not have been enough to trigger the generation of antibodies. 
Assuming the dog's initial diagnosis was correct, pet dogs the world over could potentially become infected with SARS-CoV-2. But they likely wouldn't get sick. And to reiterate, based on what we know about other coronaviruses, it's unlikely that humans can catch the virus by snuggling with their pets. 
Just in case, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people with COVID-19 have someone else walk and care for their companion animals while they are sick. And people should always wash their hands after snuggling with animals anyway, as companion pets can spread other diseases to people, according to the CDC. Keeping these precautions in mind, a Hong Kong animal welfare organizations emphasized that pet owners are highly unlikely to catch COVID-19 from their animals.
"We wish to remind the public that there is no evidence that companion animals can transmit the disease to humans," Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), the largest independent animal welfare charity group in Hong Kong, said in a statement, according to the Post. "Currently, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare," the World Organisation for Animal Health added in a statement.

Coronavirus in the US: Latest COVID-19 news and case counts
Cases of COVID-19 have surpassed 100,000 in the United States, doubling in just three days. On Wednesday (March 25), the U.S. became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, its case count surpassing both China, where the outbreak began, and Italy, a country seeing a surge in new cases every day. Since the novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in the U.S. on Jan. 20, it has spread to at least 124,686 people in the U.S., across all 50 states.
Of those reported cases, 2,191 people have died in the U.S. from the virus, with at least 883 of those deaths in New York and 189 in Washington state. Globally, more than 681,706 cases have been confirmed, with 31,882 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard.
—New York cases have surged, accounting for about half of all U.S. cases, with about 53,455 confirmed to have COVID-19 in the state. 
—President Trump signed into law a $2 trillion rescue bill to send resources to the health care system, businesses and workers.
—The USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship, set off from Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday (March 28) for its destination in New York City, where it will dock Monday (March 30) and be used for treating patients not infected with COVID-19. Another similar ship, the USNS Mercy has set sail for Los Angeles. 
—Certain hotspots seem to be starting to emerge in the Midwest, according to Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, who added that two counties in particular, Wayne County in Michigan and Cook County in Illinois, are seeing a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases, The Washington Post reported.
—The House of Representatives will attempt to pass the $2.2 trillion rescue bill to send resources to the health care system, businesses and workers. But it could be held up by procedure.
—The USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship, will set off from Norfolk, Virginia, today (March 28) for its destination in New York City, where it will dock Monday (March 30) and be used for treating patients not infected with COVID-19, The Hill reported. Another similar ship, the USNS Mercy has set sail for Los Angeles. 
—Florida governor has ordered a 14-day quarantine or isolation for anyone traveling from New York, New Jersey or Connecticut back to the Sunshine State, CNN reported.
The hospital ship USNS Comfort is expected to dock at Manhattan Cruise Terminal's Pier 90 on Monday (March 30), USA Today reported. The ship, which will be used to treat non-COVID-19 patients, is equipped with 12 operating rooms, with "hospital beds, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab, digital radiology, a CAT scan, two oxygen-producing plants and a helicopter deck," the U.S. Department of Defense reported. A 1,200-strong medical staff from the U.S. Navy will operate the hospital.
Nearly 31,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in New York City as of Saturday afternoon (March 28), with 672 deaths related to the novel coronavirus. Hospitals across the U.S. are desperate for medical supplies, including personal protection equipment (PPE), such as proper face masks, and ventilators, according to several news reports. In a recent Tweet, an internal medicine resident in New York City, said: "I feel I must tweet because the press does not reflect our reality. The deluge is here. Our ICU is completely full with intubated COVID patients. We are rapidly moving to expand capacity. We are nearly out of PPE. I anticipate we will begin rationing today." 
US coronavirus hotspots
Cases of this virus are ramping up rapidly in a few U.S. cities, which could become the next epicenters of the virus in the U.S. if the trajectory doesn’t change, according to multiple news reports. Axios reported that cases are rising in Boston, Detroit, New Orleans and Philadelphia.  
On Friday (March 26), New Orleans had 1,170 COVID-19 cases, of the state’s total of 2,746, according to WDSU News. The city of Detroit has reported 1,075 COVID-19 cases, a little under one-third of Michigan’s total, 3,657, clickondetroit.com reported. And Philly has logged 475 cases to date, out of Pennsylvania’s nearly 1,700 cases, CBS Philly reported.
Coronavirus rescue plan
Here's what the bill looks like, according to a breakdown of the bill by Bloomberg.com: About $532 billion would go to "big business, local government loans and financial assistance," including $61 billion that would go directly to airlines. About $377 billion would go to small business loans and grants. About $290 billion would provide direct payments to families in certain tax brackets; $260 billion in unemployment insurance; $290 billion in tax cuts; and $150 billion for state and local stimulus finds. The following "miscellaneous" funds are also part of the rescue bill: $126 billion to hospitals and other health care facilities; $45 billion for FEMA; $31 billion for education stabilization; $27 billion for vaccines and stockpiles; $25 billion for infrastructure; and $131 billion for "other."
Coronavirus reshaping American life
Across the country, the novel coronavirus has transformed daily life. At least 18 states, and several cities in other states, have now ordered residents to shelter in place, affecting more than 100 million people: California; Delaware; Atlanta, Georgia; Hawaii; Illinois; Indiana, Louisiana; Massachusetts, Michigan; Kansas City and St. Louis County in Missouri; New Mexico; New Jersey; New York; Ohio; Oregon; several counties in Pennsylvania; South Carolina, Virginia; Washington; West Virginia; Wisconsin, USA Today reported. Texas governor left stay-at-home decisions to local governments: Dallas County has ordered stay-at-home orders, according to USA Today. 
More than 46 states have closed all public schools for weeks, some not opening this academic year, according to Education Week. Hospitals are preparing for a tsunami of patients, canceling elective procedures, repurposing their facilities for coronavirus patients, and adding extra beds. On Friday (March 13), the CDC issued new guidance on school closure; schools may need to be closed for 8 to 20 weeks to have any impact on the course of the disease. Shorter closures may have no impact, the CDC said, and locales that have closed schools, such as Hong Kong, have not had better containment success than places that have kept them open, such as Singapore.

Late Friday (March 13), Congress passed a bill meant to help those who have been affected by coronavirus. The bill expands access to free testing, expands sick leave for those who are most vulnerable, and provides food aid. President Donald Trump also declared a national emergency. On Wednesday (March 25), the Trump administration and U.S. senators passed an historic $2 trillion rescue plan to help boost the faltering economy and help hard-hit Americans and industries, NPR reported. 
On Monday (March 16), Trump recommended that people work from home, stay out of school, avoid restaurants, bars and avoid all gatherings of more than 10 people, though he kept short of enforcing it. The president has also suspended all travel from Europe to the U.S. for the next 30 days.

As of March 26, 92 state and local public health laboratories in 50 states and the District of Columbia have working COVID-19 diagnostic tests, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced. As of March 26, the CDC and public labs in the U.S. had tested more than 112,582 specimens; that doesn't equate to that many individuals tested, as labs may run two tests per person to confirm an infection. When commercial labs are added in, a total of nearly 541,000 COVID-19 tests have been run in the U.S. as of Friday (March 27), according to the COVID Tracking Project.
States differ in their rates of testing, with California completing 20,386 tests with another 57,400 pending results, and New York running more than 122,000; that’s compared with about 871 in Missouri and 924 in Arizona as of March 26. In fact, New York, California and Washington state — where just one-fifth of the U.S. population resides, collectively — have run nearly half of all tests conducted across the country, The Atlantic reported. 
On Tuesday (March 24), the FDA granted the San Diego-based Mesa Biotech an "emergency use authorization" for its rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19 (called Accula SARS-CoV-2 Test), which delivers results in 30 minutes, Forbes reported. The firm's CEO said the device fits in the palm of your hand and can easily be sent out to point-of-care locations for testing.
The news follows another EUA granted to California-based company Cepheid for a rapid COVID-19 test whose results take 45 minutes, Live Science reported. There are 5,000 systems in the U.S. capable of running this rapid test, which Cepheid said it would start shipping out March 30. 
LabCorp, which processes samples collected by state health departments and hospitals, said it will now be able to run 20,000 tests a day, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
In addition, Deborah Birx, a member of the president's coronavirus task force, said that the U.S. had granted emergency authorization for Roche holdings to release its automated test, which should rapidly scale up the ability to conduct testing.
Testing varies by state. Just a few days ago, New York was running only a few hundred COVID-19 tests a day, The New York Times reported, but that is ramping up — On Wednesday night (March 18), the governor reported 7,584 tests had been run. To date, New York has run more than 45,000 tests, according to the COVID Testing Project. In Washington state, the University of Washington Virology Lab can run about 2,200 samples a day (with a goal of 5,000 per day), while the state’s public health lab can process 200 a day with the goal of 400 samples being run per day, the health department reported.

Frontline health care workers hit
Two emergency room (ER) doctors have tested positive for COVID-19 and are in critical condition, Dr. William Jaquis, the president of the American College of Emergency Physicians announced on Saturday (March 14). One is a man in his 40s in Washington state; another is a 70-year-old physician, James Pruden, in Paterson, New Jersey, who was leading the emergency preparedness plan at St. Joseph's University Medical Center. 
"I am deeply saddened by this news, but not surprised," Jaquis wrote in the statement. "As emergency physicians, we know the risks of our calling. We stand united with our colleagues and our thoughts and prayers for a full and speedy recovery are with each of them and their families." 
Because there is widespread community transmission in Washington, it's not clear if the man became infected in the ER, or outside of it. He wore appropriate personal protective equipment at all times, the statement read.
The New Jersey doctor came down with respiratory symptoms several days ago, and is now in an isolation unit in the ICU. 
This is not the first time that doctors, nurses and health care workers on the frontline have become infected with COVID-19. A health care worker in Solano County, California, tested positive after a patient with the virus was admitted to a hospital there, the Sacramento Bee reported. She was not tested for several days, and more than 200 people who had contact with that person were quarantined. Several healthcare workers in the Seattle area are now infected with COVID-19, according to KUOW. 
And frontline medical providers across the U.S. are bracing for coronavirus amid a cascade of rapidly changing guidance on how to protect themselves and treat patients, Live Science reported.
Hospital transmission is a growing concern for doctors and nurses facing a shortage of masks, the Los Angeles Times reported. On Tuesday (March 9), the CDC released guidance saying that looser-fitting, thinner, surgical masks, rather than N95 respirators — which filter out 95% of airborne particles bigger than 5 microns — would be sufficient for many doctors and nurses treating patients with the new coronavirus. That guidance was meant to protect the rapidly dwindling U.S. supply of N95 respirators. The Strategic National Stockpile, meant to provide supplies in an emergency, contains just 1% of the needed 3.5 billion N95 masks that could be needed for health care workers, CNBC reported. 
Health care workers are at high risk of infection; a study published March 13 in the journal the Lancet found that 20% of frontline health care workers in northern Italy have become infected with COVID-19. And as Live Science previously reported, a study from China found that N95 respirators were more effective than surgical masks at protecting health care workers from COVID-19. That study, published to the preprint database medRxiv, has not been through peer review.

What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus?
Here's how you could catch COVID-19.
Symptoms of the novel coronavirus can mimic the flu or even a common cold.
How will you know if you have the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease? Doctors have described some of the most common symptoms, including some rare ones, such as a loss of smell, that could signal you should get tested.
According to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch, the virus could ultimately infect between 40% and 70% of the population worldwide in the coming year.
Many of those cases would be mild, and some people might show no symptoms at all. But the prospect of being infected with a new virus can be frightening. The symptoms to look out for, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are fever, coughing and shortness of breath. These symptoms usually appear between two days and two weeks of exposure to the virus. 
Doctors recently added "loss of smell" as a potential symptom that may show up alone without any other symptoms, Live Science reported. 
According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, as many as 98% of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized had a fever, between 76% and 82% had a dry cough, and 11% to 44% reported exhaustion and fatigue.

The disease appears to become more severe with age, with the 30- to 79-year-old age range predominating the detected cases in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, according to a study in JAMA. Children seem to be at less risk of suffering noticeable symptoms of the disease. However, a recent study of 2,000 children confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 found that 6% developed severe or critical illness. The study is detailed in the March 16 issue of the journal Pediatrics.
In more serious cases of COVID-19, patients experience pneumonia, which means their lungs begin to fill with pockets of pus or fluid. This leads to intense shortness of breath and painful coughing. 
Currently, testing for the virus that causes COVID-19 in the United States is still relatively limited to people with more severe symptoms, according to Paul Biddinger, the director of the emergency preparedness research, evaluation and practice program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who spoke in a university webcast March 2. This means that it isn't appropriate to be tested at the first sign of a fever or sniffle. Seeking medical care for mild illness can also potentially transmit that illness, or lead to catching new illnesses in the hospital or clinic, Biddinger added. 
Ultimately, the decisions about who should be tested are left to the discretion of state and local health departments, according to the CDC.
If you become ill with these symptoms and think you've been exposed to the virus, the CDC recommends calling your doctor first rather than traveling to a clinic. Physicians work with state health departments and the CDC to determine who should be tested for the new virus. However, the CDC also recommends that people with COVID-19 or any respiratory illness monitor their symptoms carefully. Worsening shortness of breath is reason to seek medical care, particularly for older individuals or people with underlying health conditions. The CDC information page has more information on what to do if you are sick.

The coronavirus did not escape from a lab. Here's how we know.
Viruses like the novel coronavirus are shells holding genetic material.
As the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 spreads across the globe, with cases surpassing 284,000 worldwide today (March 20), misinformation is spreading almost as fast. 
One persistent myth is that this virus, called SARS-CoV-2, was made by scientists and escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began.
A new analysis of SARS-CoV-2 may finally put that latter idea to bed. A group of researchers compared the genome of this novel coronavirus with the seven other coronaviruses known to infect humans: SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, which can cause severe disease; along with HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, which typically cause just mild symptoms, the researchers wrote March 17 in the journal Nature Medicine.
"Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus," they write in the journal article. 
Related: 13 coronavirus myths busted by science
Kristian Andersen, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research, and his colleagues looked at the genetic template for the spike proteins that protrude from the surface of the virus. The coronavirus uses these spikes to grab the outer walls of its host's cells and then enter those cells. They specifically looked at the gene sequences responsible for two key features of these spike proteins: the grabber, called the receptor-binding domain, that hooks onto host cells; and the so-called cleavage site that allows the virus to open and enter those cells. 
Here's why: SARS-CoV-2 is very closely related to the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which fanned across the globe nearly 20 years ago. Scientists have studied how SARS-CoV differs from SARS-CoV-2 — with several key letter changes in the genetic code. Yet in computer simulations, the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 don't seem to work very well at helping the virus bind to human cells. If scientists had deliberately engineered this virus, they wouldn't have chosen mutations that computer models suggest won't work. But it turns out, nature is smarter than scientists, and the novel coronavirus found a way to mutate that was better — and completely different— from anything scientists could have created, the study found. 
Another nail in the "escaped from evil lab" theory?  The overall molecular structure of this virus is distinct from the known coronaviruses and instead most closely resembles viruses found in bats and pangolins that had been little studied and never known to cause humans any harm. 
"If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness," according to a statement from Scripps. 
Where did the virus come from? The research group came up with two possible scenarios for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. One scenario follows the origin stories for a few other recent coronaviruses that have wreaked havoc in human populations. In that scenario, we contracted the virus directly from an animal — civets in the case of SARS and camels in the case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the researchers suggest that animal was a bat, which transmitted the virus to another intermediate animal (possibly a pangolin, some scientists have said) that brought the virus to humans.
Related: 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history
In that possible scenario, the genetic features that make the new coronavirus so effective at infecting human cells (its pathogenic powers) would have been in place before hopping to humans.
In the other scenario, those pathogenic features would have evolved only after the virus jumped from its animal host to humans. Some coronaviruses that originated in pangolins have a "hook structure" (that receptor binding domain) similar to that of SARS-CoV-2. In that way, a pangolin either directly or indirectly passed its virus onto a human host. Then, once inside a human host, the virus could have evolved to have its other stealth feature — the cleavage site that lets it easily break into human cells. Once it developed that capacity, the researchers said, the coronavirus would be even more capable of spreading between people.
All of this technical detail could help scientists forecast the future of this pandemic. If the virus did enter human cells in a pathogenic form, that raises the probability of future outbreaks. The virus could still be circulating in the animal population and might again jump to humans, ready to cause an outbreak. But the chances of such future outbreaks are lower if the virus must first enter the human population and then evolve the pathogenic properties, the researchers said.

Glad that there's been an article debunking this. It's depressing how many people on the forums think that this virus was manmade.
I still will observe and wait for more information. The fact that Wuhan has a level 4 lab in place (known since the 80s) is still troubling imho. Maybe they just had the virus intact as is and were studying it. Seems coincidental to me. But hey you guys are scientists, and you're always right. And propaganda doesn't exist....
Glad that there's been an article debunking this. It's depressing how many people on the forums think that this virus was manmade.
This article is misleading. Most viruses held in labs are not genetically engineered and originate from natural sources. Just because this virus isn’t genetically modified does not mean the pandemic did not originate from a lab accident. I doubt we’ll ever know the truth, but the fact is, an accidental release from a lab is still plausible especially given...

How does the COVID-19 pandemic compare to the last pandemic?
There are some key differences between the 2009 swine flu and COVID-19, and the response to each of them.
A nurse walking by a triage tent set up outside of the emergency room at Sutter Delta Medical Center in Antioch, California on April 30, 2009. The hospital was preparing for a potential flood of patients worried they might have swine flu.
It's been a little over a decade since the world experienced its last pandemic, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu. Between the spring of 2009 and the spring of 2010, the virus infected as many as 1.4 billion people across the globe and killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people, according to the Centers for Disease Protection and Control. Now, the world is in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. 
Having been through a pandemic in recent history, it seems reasonable to expect that government agencies in the U.S. would be prepared for the next one. But there are some key differences between the 2009 swine flu and COVID-19, and the response to each of them. 
"The 2009 H1N1 pandemic should have been a warning sign," said Steffanie Strathdee, the Associate Dean of Global Health Sciences at the University of California San Diego's Department of Medicine. "It didn't end up being a pandemic that killed millions of people as we feared it would, but it should have been a wake-up call. By all serious estimates, COVID-19 is going to be a major killer." 
Strathdee is also the author of "The Perfect Predator" (Hachette Books, 2019), a memoir of her personal experience fighting a deadly microbial pathogen, a superbug called Acinetobacter baumannii, and witnessing her husband almost die from it. Her husband fully recovered, but is at high risk of developing serious complications if the COVID-19 pandemic reaches him. 
The 2009 flu pandemic was the second H1N1 pandemic the world had seen — the first being the 1918 Spanish flu, still the most deadly pandemic in history. The 2009 pandemic was caused by a new strain of H1N1 that originated in Mexico in the spring of 2009 before spreading to the rest of the world. By June of that year, there were enough cases that the World Health Organization declared the swine flu outbreak a pandemic. 
In the U.S., between April 2009 and April 2010, the CDC estimates there were 60.8 million cases of swine flu, with over 274,000 hospitalizations and nearly 12,500 deaths — that's a mortality rate of about 0.02%.

—How long does virus last on surfaces? 
—Is there a cure for COVID-19? 
—How does it compare with seasonal flu?

—Can people spread the coronavirus after they recover?
The mortality rate for the novel coronavirus is much higher so far, around 2% (although the number will likely change as more people are tested). That may not sound like a big difference, "but when extrapolated, can mean millions more deaths," Strathdee said.
The 2009 flu pandemic primarily affected children and young adults, and 80% of the deaths were in people younger than 65, the CDC reported. That was unusual, considering that most strains of flu viruses, including those that cause seasonal flu, cause the highest percentage of deaths in people ages 65 and older. But in the case of the swine flu, older people seemed to have already built up enough immunity to the group of viruses that H1N1 belongs to, so weren't affected as much.
There is typically some herd immunity to seasonal flu, Strathdee said. This means that so many people are immune to the infection, because of vaccines or because their immune system has already fought the infection, that the few people who aren't immune are somewhat protected. There might be some groups of people who have immunity to the 2019-CoV-2 virus, too, but that's an area that's still being researched. So far, COVID-19 is most deadly for people over 60 who have underlying health conditions.
Another difference is that flu viruses are spread in respiratory droplets and airborne particles, while 2019-CoV-2 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets, and in some instances may be shed in feces, Strathdee said. "We don't yet know how important the oral-fecal route of infection is, but it's another reason to wash your hands regularly with soap and water," she said.
The symptoms of the swine flu were similar to those caused by other flu viruses, primarily: fever, cough, headache, body aches, sore throat, chills, fatigue and runny nose. Those symptoms show up between one and four days after contracting the virus. 
Doctors are still determining the full breadth of symptoms of COVID-19. So far, the clearest signs of the disease appear to be fever, dry cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. Other symptoms, including headache, sore throat, abdominal pain and diarrhea, have been reported, but are less common. And just like the flu, COVID-19 can cause respiratory issues that lead to serious problems, such as pneumonia.
But some people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, or they may not experience symptoms at all, according to the CDC. The virus appears to have an incubation period of between four and 14 days, which means an individual could be carrying (and spreading) the virus for up to two weeks before experiencing any illness. 
The H1N1 flu was also less contagious than the novel coronavirus. The basic reproduction number, also called the R-nought value, is the expected number of individuals who can catch the virus from a single infected person. For the 2009 H1N1 virus, the mean R-nought value was 1.46, according to a review published in the journal BMC Infectious Diseases. For the novel coronavirus, the R-nought value is estimated to be between 2 and 2.5, at the moment. 
There have been a few differences in the way the U.S. responded to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic compared with the nation's response to COVID-19 pandemic. 
"A major difference in response is that we were better prepared for a pandemic (at least in the U.S.) years ago," Strathdee said. 
At the beginning of both pandemics, the genetic sequences of the virus were released to the public with remarkable speed, so that countries could create diagnostic tests as soon as possible. On April 24, 2009, just nine days after initial detection of H1N1, the CDC uploaded genetic sequences of the virus to a public database and had already begun development of a vaccine. Similarly, on Jan. 12, 2020, five days after the novel coronavirus was isolated, Chinese scientists published the virus' genetic sequence. 
The first case of COVID-19 in the U.S was identified on Jan. 20, and the country's Department of Health and Human Services declared COVID-19 a public health emergency 11 days later, on Jan. 31. Similarly, the U.S. declared the swine flu a public health emergency 11 days after the first confirmed U.S. case in 2009. 
But that's about where the similarities stop. Things haven't happened quite as fast or as smoothly with COVID-19 as they did with H1N1. 
Within four weeks of detecting H1N1 in 2009, the CDC had begun releasing health supplies from their stockpile that could prevent and treat influenza, and most states in the U.S. had labs capable of diagnosing H1N1 without verification by a CDC test. 
But diagnostic testing ran into significant hiccups when it came to COVID-19. On Feb. 5, the CDC began sending diagnostic kits for 2019-CoV-2 to about 100 public-health laboratories across the country. Most of the labs received faulty kits, which caused a major delay in combating the virus. Testing had to continue exclusively at the CDC headquarters until the agency could develop and send out replacement kits. This meant that COVID-19 continued to spread, undetected for weeks.
The FDA commissioner announced on Feb. 29 that the agency would allow labs across the country to begin testing for the novel coronavirus with their own lab-developed tests without prior approval, as long as the labs took basic steps to validate the tests and submitted an "emergency use authorization" (EUA) application within 15 days of the notice.
Related: Confusion and chaos surround coronavirus testing in the US
By March 10, seven weeks after the first confirmed case in the U.S., the CDC announced that 79 state and local health labs in the United States could test people for COVID-19. But some of those labs are already running out of supplies to run the tests.
"Another difference is that this is the first pandemic in the era of social media," Strathdee said. The wealth of misinformation about the disease has spread faster than the virus, she said, as has blame for the virus. "We need to stop thinking like this. We need to unite against the virus."
However, the plus side of living in this advanced technological age is the speed at which research and vaccine development can occur. A potential treatment and the first trial of a candidate vaccine are already underway, which is amazing and encouraging, Strathdee said. "It will take time for a vaccine and treatments to be studied and scaled up," she said. "So in the meantime, we all need to do our part and stay home."

Here’s how long the coronavirus will last on surfaces, and how to disinfect those surfaces.
As the coronavirus outbreak continues to accelerate in the U.S., cleaning supplies are disappearing off the shelves and people are worried about every subway rail, kitchen counter and toilet seat they touch. 
But how long can the new coronavirus linger on surfaces, anyway? The short answer is, we don't know. A new analysis found that the virus can remain viable in the air for up to 3 hours, on copper for up to 4 hours, on cardboard up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel up to 72 hours. This study was originally published in the preprint database medRxiv on March 11,  and now a revised version was published March 17 in The New England Journal of Medicine. 
What's more, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on "a variety of surfaces" in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people who were infected with COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, up to 17 days after the passengers disembarked, according to a new analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, this was before disinfection procedures took place and "data cannot be used to determine whether transmission occurred from contaminated surfaces," according to the analysis. In other words, it's not clear if the viral particles on these surfaces could have infected people.
Another study published in February in The Journal of Hospital Infection analyzed several dozen previously published papers on human coronaviruses (other than the new coronavirus) to get a better idea of how long they can survive outside of the body.

They concluded that if this new coronavirus resembles other human coronaviruses, such as its "cousins" that cause SARS and MERS, it can stay on surfaces —  such as metal, glass or plastic — for as long as nine days (In comparison, flu viruses can last on surfaces for only about 48 hours.)
But some of them don't remain active for as long at temperatures higher than 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). The authors also found that these coronaviruses can be effectively wiped away by household disinfectants. 
For example, disinfectants with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) can "efficiently" inactivate coronaviruses within a minute, according to the study. "We expect a similar effect against the 2019-nCoV," the researchers wrote, referring to the new coronavirus. But even though the new coronavirus is a similar strain to the SARS coronavirus, it's not clear if it will behave the same.
Diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions containing at least 70% alcohol and most EPA-registered common household disinfectants should be effective at disinfecting surfaces against the coronavirus, according to the CDC. The bleach solution can be prepared by mixing 5 tablespoons (one-third cup) of bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, the CDC wrote in a set of recommendations.
However, "never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser," the CDC said. Mixing common cleaners together can create toxic fumes, according to a previous Live Science report. For example, when bleach is mixed with an acidic solution, a chemical reaction produces chlorine gas, which can cause irritation of the eyes, throat and nose. At high concentrations, that gas can cause breathing difficulties and fluid in the lungs, and at very high concentrations it can lead to death, according to the report.
It's possible that a person can be infected with the virus by touching a contaminated surface or object, "then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "But this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads." Though the virus remains viable in the air, the new study can't say whether people can become infected by breathing it in from the air,  according to the Associated Press. 
The virus is most likely to spread from person to person through close contact and respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes that can land on a nearby person's mouth or nose, according to the CDC.
If a person in a household is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, "clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas," according to the CDC's recommendations. Common household areas include tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets and sinks.
What's more, "As much as possible, an ill person should stay in a specific room and away from other people in their home," they wrote. The caregiver should try to stay away from the ill person as much as possible; this means the ill person, if possible, should clean and disinfect surfaces themselves. If that's not possible, the caregiver should wait "as long as practical" after an ill person uses the bathroom to clean and disinfect surfaces, according to the CDC.

Coronavirus outbreak officially declared a pandemic, WHO says
It's the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus, officials said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, after the disease caused by the new coronavirus spread to more than 100 countries and led to tens of thousands of cases within a few months.
"We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity [of COVID-19], and by the alarming levels of inaction," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of WHO, said at a news conference on today (March 11). "We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic."
This is the first time WHO has declared a pandemic over a coronavirus, Ghebreyesus said. He noted that the number of COVID-19 cases reported outside China has soared in recent days, rising 13-fold in the past two weeks. There have been more than 120,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 4,300 deaths attributed to the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University.

WHO has been cautious in its decision to declare a pandemic, because the word, "if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over," Ghebreyesus said.
But he stressed that the declaration of a pandemic today does not change the threat of the virus or what countries should do to respond. "We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action," Ghebreyesus said. "We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear."
Ghebreyesus said countries should be working to detect, isolate and treat COVID-19 cases and trace COVID-19 patients' contacts; to protect and train health care workers and prepare hospitals; and to communicate with members of the public about the risks of the disease and how to protect themselves.
There's been so much attention on the word "pandemic," Ghebreyesus said. "Let me give you some other words that matter much more ... Prevention. Preparedness. Public health. Political leadership. And most of all, people," he said. 
The declaration of a pandemic comes more than a month after WHO declared COVID-19 a "public health emergency of international concern."

A new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 is spreading across the globe. Kids like you are likely wondering, "Will school be closed?" and, "Should I be worried about getting sick?" To help guide you through a confusing situation, here are answers from science to all the questions you may have. For a visual look at coronavirus science, check out our "just for kids" coronavirus infographic. And here's a round-up of activities and online resources for homebound kids.
What is a virus?
A virus is a teensy, tiny germ, way smaller than anything you can see. Viruses can make us sick, but they can't do anything on their own — they need to live inside another creature (their host) to survive. To do that, they have to get into our cells.
What is the coronavirus?
You may have noticed lots of adults talking about a "coronavirus." There is a new kind of this virus spreading around the world. It's called a coronavirus because "corona" means "crown" in Latin. And the virus looks like it's wearing a spiky crown.
Mostly, it makes people cough, feel tired and have a fever. But older people and people who have other conditions can get very sick from it. The disease the virus causes is called COVID-19.
Where did the coronavirus come from?
The virus was first found in a city in China, called Wuhan, last December. But we think the virus actually comes from bats. From there, it hopped into another type of animal, who gave it to humans. No one knows for sure what this mystery animal was, but some people think it might have been a pangolin, a scaly animal that eats ants. 
How does the virus get into cells in the body?
The virus enters cells using a special "door" on the outside of human cells. The new coronavirus also needs a "key" to get into cells. In this case, the coronavirus has a special "spike" on its surface that it uses as a key to open the door.
Once inside cells, the virus makes lots of copies of itself. Those copies break out of cells, then infect other cells. At a certain point, there are so many virus particles being produced that our normal cells can't work properly … and we get sick.

Viruses make people sick by killing human cells or making them not work properly. Like we said, the new coronavirus uses a special door to get into cells. Those special doorways are on cells in the nose and lungs. If the virus grows too much in the lungs, it can make it hard to breathe. That is called pneumonia.
Luckily, your body has an army to fight germs like the coronavirus. It's called the immune system. When a virus enters your body, the immune system attacks the virus. You know how you can get a fever, headache or runny nose when you're sick? That's caused by the immune system, and it's good! These yucky symptoms are signs that your body is fighting the virus.
Most people who get COVID-19 just have symptoms like a cough, fever or runny nose. Doctors are not sure why, but some people get really sick. Some peoples' immune systems may not fight hard enough. Other peoples' immune systems may fight too hard, hurting their own cells. Both of these things can make people sicker.
Related: What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus?
There's a special test to see if you have COVID-19. If you feel sick, tell your parents. They will call your doctor to see if you need the test. It's just like a flu test; they stick a Q-tip up your nose and test your snot for the virus. The results come back a day later. 
Related: How do the new coronavirus tests work?
You can help stop the virus by washing your hands. This means sudsing up with soap and rubbing your hands together to clean all your fingers, under the fingernails and between the fingers. You can sing the ABCs or come up with another tune that lasts about 20 seconds. 
Also, try to keep your hands off your face, so no rubbing your eyes or nose or putting your hands in your mouth. That way, if there is any of the virus on your hands, you won't give it a way to enter the body where it can make you sick.
There's no need for you to worry, because adults are working very hard to keep kids and other adults safe. Even if you do get this virus, kids usually don't get very sick from it. It's more like a mild cold. 
But you still have a special role to play in protecting others! Older people, like grandparents, need your help to stay healthy. That means washing your hands and staying home if you're sick. It may also mean skipping your activities or not going to school if your principal and other grown-ups in charge decide that's best. That can slow down the spread of the virus and protect older and sicker people.
Doctors and government officials are working hard to make sure families stay safe. That's why they may ask people to cancel activities, like sports events. They may close schools to stop the virus from spreading. They may tell you to keep your distance from other people when you're out. All these tricks make it hard for the virus to jump from one person to the next. If the virus can't spread, fewer people get sick.
Doctors are also working hard to care for sick people. Scientists are trying to make a coronavirus vaccine — kind of like the shots you get at the doctor's office. Others are trying to make medicines to help sick people get better.
Each school may make a different decision. Schools may close if there are lots of cases of COVID-19 in your area or if someone at the school gets the virus. But it's not easy to close schools. There are many things to think about before doing that. For example, some children eat school meals and may not have enough food at home if schools close. And parents who work in hospitals may not be able to care for sick people if they need to stay home with their children. Parents, teachers and principals probably won't decide to close a school on their own. City leaders will help make the decision.
When could the coronavirus outbreak end?
We don't know for sure. (I know, not what you want to hear!) But using math, we can make educated guesses. Left on its own, the virus would take many months to spread all around the world. But that doesn't mean your city would be affected for that long. And a vaccine could stop the virus sooner — if scientists can create one.
Some scientists think that the virus will go away when the weather gets warm. That's what happens with other coronaviruses and the flu. Lots of viruses like cold, dry air. But we don't know if that is true for this new virus.

1st person in US gets experimental coronavirus vaccine
The vaccine was fast-tracked to human trials, but it will still be some time before it's ready for public use.
A healthy volunteer in Seattle is the first person in the U.S. to receive a dose of an experimental coronavirus vaccine as part of a new clinical trial, government health officials announced today (March 16).   
Over the next six weeks, researchers plan to enroll 45 participants in the trial, which will test the safety of the vaccine as well as its ability to induce an immune response in the volunteers. The trial will take place at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) allowed the new vaccine to be fast-tracked into clinical trials without thorough testing in animal models, which usually stands as a strict prerequisite to human testing. While making the jump to human trials could bring the vaccine to market faster, this is only step one. 
New drugs must pass through three iterative phases of clinical trials before being deemed safe and effective for widespread use. Assuming the initial tests go well, it may be 12 to 18 months before any vaccine is ready for public use, NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci told the House Oversight and Reform Committee on March 12. 
"Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority," Fauci said in a NIAID statement, published March 16. "This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal."
The new vaccine is a collaboration between NIAID scientists and the biotechnology company Moderna Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The trial launched today is known as a "Phase 1 clinical trial," meaning its main purpose is to provide information about how the vaccine interacts with a healthy human body, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
Phase 1 trials examine a small group of people, typically between 20 and 80 individuals, who receive different doses of an experimental treatment. Over the course of several months, researchers monitor how each volunteer metabolizes the given treatment and what common side effects emerge in response to different doses. The 45 volunteers in the new trial will receive varying doses of the new vaccine, called mRNA-1273, and be monitored over a 14-month period. Volunteers will receive two injections of the vaccine in the upper arm, with a 28-day gap between doses.

The first participant will receive the lowest dose of the vaccine, at 25 micrograms (mcg) per injection, according to the NIAID statement. Three others will receive the same initial dose, and four more will each receive a 100-mcg dose of the vaccine and be thoroughly evaluated before any volunteers are given their second dose. If participants' reactions to the low doses prove acceptable, a third group of participants will receive 250 mcg of the vaccine per injection.     
In addition to monitoring for side effects, the researchers will test whether the vaccine triggers an immune response by analyzing the volunteers' blood for antibodies, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. 
If the vaccine works as designed, the immune system should generate antibodies that grab hold of a characteristic protein found on the surface of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, according to a report by Kaiser Permanente, the health care company conducting the trial. Rather than introducing a dead or weakened virus into the body to prompt this reaction, as conventional vaccines do, the vaccine instructs cells to build the viral protein themselves using a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). Once utilized by the body, the mRNA should break down and be eliminated, leaving only protective antibodies behind.  
Following the Phase 1 trial of the experimental vaccine, the drug must then be tested in larger groups of people and over longer periods of time, in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
Phase 2 trials typically examine several hundred people and monitor participants for periods of from several months to two years. Primarily, Phase 2 trials serve as a secondary measure of safety and help researchers to refine the dosing of a particular medication. At this stage, researchers select participants with characteristics, such as age and physical health, that match those of the people who the vaccine is being developed for. (For example, although anyone can contract COVID-19, those of advanced age and those with chronic conditions are more likely to develop severe symptoms, so this could be a consideration in Phase 2 trials.) 
Phase 3 trials typically follow 300 to 3,000 volunteers over the course of one to four years, according to the FDA. With a larger group of people, researchers can take note of unusual side effects of the drug, and by lengthening the study period, they can catch long-term side effects as they emerge. Phase 3 trials must demonstrate that a given drug provides the medical benefits it's intended to; if this coronavirus vaccine passes that test, the FDA could approve the drug for widespread use.
Following approval by the FDA, drugs undergo Phase 4 clinical trials, otherwise known as "post-marketing surveillance trials." Once a drug enters public use, researchers monitor several thousand volunteers to spot side effects not seen in earlier trials and to track how well the vaccine works over extended periods of time, according to the National Cancer Institute.
This coronavirus vaccine may or may not reach Phase 4 trials in the coming years, though, so far, limited studies in mice have shown promising results. In the meantime, research groups around the world will continue to develop alternate vaccines to combat the spread of COVID-19, according to The Associated Press.

SXSW canceled amid coronavirus fears
For the first time since 1987, the annual event South by Southwest (SXSW) will not take place this March in Austin, Texas. Amid escalating COVID-19 coronavirus fears, the city decided to shut the event down.
SXSW was scheduled to take place between March 13 and March 22. The festival is perhaps the largest yet of the numerous events to have been postponed amid the global outbreak. Some public health experts have expressed concerns that large gatherings of people could become breeding grounds from the virus.

COVID-19 appears to be spreading unchecked in parts of the United States (particularly in Washington State), as cases of community spread continue to outpace the federal government's limited and botched early testing efforts. Other countries, such as South Korea, have been able to more successfully track and fight the virus due to extensive testing regimes.
The overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus will experience mild cases that are not life threatening. However, it is important to avoid spreading the virus because a small but not insignificant minority of the infected will experience severe symptoms and may die.
Individuals should wash their hands frequently and follow the advice of local public health officials and their doctors.

Scientists figure out how new coronavirus breaks into human cells
Scientists have revealed the first picture of how the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 binds with human respiratory cells in order to hijack them to produce more viruses. 
Researchers led by Qiang Zhou, a research fellow at Westlake University in Hangzhou, China, have revealed how the new virus attaches to a receptor on respiratory cells called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2. 
"They have pictures all the way down at the level of the atoms that interact at the binding interface," Thomas Gallagher, a virologist at Loyola University Chicago who was not involved in the new research but studies coronavirus structure, told Live Science. That level of information is unusual at this stage of a new virus outbreak, he said. 
"The virus outbreak only began to occur a couple months ago, and within that short period of time, these authors have come up with information that I think traditionally takes much longer," Gallagher said. 
That's important, he said, because understanding how the virus enters cells can contribute to research on drugs or even a vaccine for the virus.

To infect a human host, viruses must be able to gain entry into individual human cells. They use these cells' machinery to produce copies of themselves, which then spill out and spread to new cells. 
On Feb. 19 in the journal Science, a research team led by scientists at the University of Texas at Austin described the tiny molecular key on SARS-CoV-2 that gives the virus entry into the cell. This key is called a spike protein, or S-protein. Last week, Zhou and his team described the rest of the puzzle: the structure of the ACE2 receptor protein (which is on the surfaces of respiratory cells) and how it and the spike protein interact. The researchers published their findings in the journal Science on March 4. 
"If we think of the human body as a house and 2019-nCoV [another name for SARS-CoV-2] as a robber, then ACE2 would be the doorknob of the house's door. Once the S-protein grabs it, the virus can enter the house," Liang Tao, a researcher at Westlake University who was not involved in the new study, said in a statement.
Zhou and his team used a tool called cryo electron microscopy, which employs deeply frozen samples and electron beams to image the tiniest structures of biological molecules. The researchers found that the molecular bond between SARS-CoV-2's spike protein and ACE2 looks fairly similar to the binding pattern of the coronavirus that caused the outbreak of SARS in 2003. There are some differences, however, in the precise amino acids used to bind SARS-CoV-2 to that ACE2 receptor compared with the virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the researchers said. 
"While some might consider the differences subtle," Gallagher said, "they might be meaningful with respect to the strength with which each of those viruses stick." 
That "stickiness" could affect how easily a virus transmits from one person to another. If any given viral particle is more likely to enter a cell once it enters the human body, transmission of disease is more likely.
There are other coronaviruses that circulate regularly, causing upper respiratory infections that most people think of as the common cold. Those coronaviruses don't interact with the ACE2 receptor, Gallagher said, but rather, they get into the body using other receptors on human cells. 
Coronavirus structure implications
The structure of SARS-CoV-2's "key" and the body's "lock" could theoretically provide a target for antiviral drugs that would stop the new coronavirus from getting into new cells. Most antiviral drugs already on the market focus on halting viral replication within the cell, so a drug that targeted viral entry would be new territory, Gallagher said. 
The viral spike protein is also a promising target for vaccines, because it's the part of the virus that interacts with its environment and so could be easily recognized by the immune system, Gallagher said. 
Even so, developing either drugs or a vaccine will be a challenging task. Treatments and vaccines not only have to prove effective against the virus, but must also be safe for people, Gallagher said. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have said that the earliest a coronavirus vaccine could be available is in a year to a year and a half.

Coronavirus in U.S.
How deadly is the new coronavirus? Data from the spread of US cases could help answer that.
More data on mild and asymptomatic cases is desperately needed.
A stretcher is moved into the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Wash., a long-term care facility where a cluster of COVID-19 cases has emerged and several people have died. Surveillance data from existing public health programs could help reveal how deadly the new coronavirus is.
As new reports of novel coronavirus cases surface along the U.S. West Coast, new research — and the existing disease surveillance network — may finally shed light on some of the most burning questions about the new virus, called SARS-CoV-2.
Among the most pressing questions: How many cases are asymptomatic, versus mild, moderate or severe? And what is the real rate of fatalities compared with the total number of cases?
Initial reports of the new coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, in December 2019, with patients presenting with pneumonia of unknown origin. As of March 2, more than 90,000 cases had been confirmed worldwide, including 45,705 cases that ended with patients recovering and more than 3,000 fatalities. On Feb. 28, U.S. health officials confirmed the first known case of the new coronavirus in a patient in the San Francisco Bay Area who had neither traveled abroad nor been exposed to someone known to have traveled to an area affected by the disease (which is called COVID-19). Since then, testing for the new coronavirus has quickly expanded, bringing the known total of cases to 105 in the U.S. Seven people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19.

—How does the coronavirus spread?
—Can people spread the coronavirus after they recover?
Genetic analysis of the virus circulating on the West Coast suggests that COVID-19 has been transmitting through the region for about six weeks. This community spread was not detected earlier for several reasons. First, about 81% of cases do not require hospitalization, according to data from the outbreak in China. People experiencing symptoms such as a mild fever, cough and congestion are unlikely to visit a doctor. Second, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol limited testing to only those with symptoms and a history of travel to an affected region. Finally, there is a lag between virus transmission and fatalities simply because it takes time for the most severe cases to kill. (A World Health Organization report from China found that it took three to six weeks for critical cases to be resolved, either when the patient died or recovered.)
What is not yet clear from the U.S. data is how many people have been infected with the new coronavirus. This number is key for understanding disease severity and the mortality rate — after all, you must know the total number of cases to know what proportion of patients will become severely ill or die. China's best data so far puts the case-fatality rate at 2.3%. But that number may drop with better detection of mild and asymptomatic cases. 
Scientists expect to know more about this number in the coming weeks. Broader testing will help, Paul Biddinger, the vice chairman for emergency preparedness in the emergency medicine department of Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health webcast on March 2. However, testing in the next days to weeks will still likely be limited to a subset of the sickest patients, Biddinger said.
"We have, right now, so few tests available that we have to prioritize testing for severe illness," he said in the webcast.
The weapons of public health
Another method of ferreting out new coronavirus cases is looking at existing influenza and respiratory illness surveillance. This is the bread-and-butter work of public health, said Jennifer Horney, the director of the epidemiology program at the University of Delaware. Most states have what's called "syndromic surveillance," in which emergency rooms, emergency medical services, poison control centers and other medical centers report occurrences of influenza-like symptoms. Washington state, for example, uses the Rapid Health Information Network (RHINO) to collect data in near real time.
Most states also have specific flu-monitoring networks, which gather reports of diagnosed influenza cases, usually on a weekly basis. All of this is information that state health departments can use to search for hints of undiagnosed COVID-19. 
"They'll be able to go back and see, Did we have more than a typical number of influenza-like illnesses, given what we know now?" Horney told Live Science.

Already, researchers are seeking out coronavirus cases in a more active way. The Seattle Flu Study, which uses genetic sequencing to track the transmission of seasonal influenza, has begun testing its samples for possible coronavirus as well as flu. The team has already reported finding a case of coronavirus in a Snohomish County high school student who had tested negative for the flu and who had been sent home to recover from mild respiratory symptoms. 
Public health researchers will also seek out cases based on interviews, similar to the way epidemiologists track an outbreak of foodborne illness, Horney said. As cases emerge, researchers reach out to hospitals and clinics in the affected area, searching for patients with telltale symptoms who were not diagnosed at the time of treatment. They can then interview those people to find out everywhere they've been and everyone they've interacted with. In the case of salmonella, a pattern might pop out: Everyone's eaten the same bagged spinach, or the same brand of fruit cup. In the case of COVID-19, the researchers might find that people with symptoms frequented the same stores or worked in the same office park. Already, the Washington state health department has monitoring contacts of the people already confirmed to have the coronavirus. 
Tracking people with symptoms — whether mild, moderate or severe — is only the beginning, however. One big question about the new coronavirus is how many people transmit COVID-19 without showing symptoms at all, or showing so few symptoms they hardly realize they are sick, Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in the March 2 webcast. Asymptomatic carriers and people with mild symptoms may be like the base of the iceberg, Lipsitch said. They're hard to detect, but they're very important for modeling how the disease will spread.
"When we model transmission and when we project how many people are going to get infected, the models don't know how many people are 'sick' or 'really sick,' they know how many are infected" regardless of severity, Lipsitch said. 
Scientists in China have already started doing studies that look for antibodies to the virus in people's blood, Lipsitch said. These studies are the only surefire way to confirm that someone has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 after the person recovers. The research will take time, but the more researchers know about the speed of the disease's spread, the more they'll be able to say about the likely length of the outbreak.
"What ultimately brings an epidemic under control," Lipsitch said, "is most people in the population becoming immune."

How does the new coronavirus compare with the flu?
The coronavirus particle has a crown of spikes on its surface.
Editor's note: Updated March 25 with the latest information on COVID-19. 
The new coronavirus causing COVID-19 has led to more than 454,000 illnesses and more than 20,550 deaths worldwide. For comparison, in the U.S. alone, the flu (also called influenza) has caused an estimated 38 million illnesses, 390,000 hospitalizations and 23,000 deaths this season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
That said, scientists have studied seasonal flu for decades. So, despite the danger of it, we know a lot about flu viruses and what to expect each season. In contrast, very little is known about the new coronavirus and the disease it causes, dubbed COVID-19, because it's so new. This means COVID-19 is something of a wild card in terms of how far it will spread and how many deaths it will cause.

"Despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there's a certainty … of seasonal flu," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a White House press conference on Jan. 31. "I can tell you all, guaranteed, that as we get into March and April, the flu cases are going to go down. You could predict pretty accurately what the range of the mortality is and the hospitalizations [will be]," Fauci said. "The issue now with [COVID-19] is that there's a lot of unknowns." (During the week ending March 14, 15.3% of tests for a respiratory illness turned out positive for flu, compared with 21.1% the week prior.) 
Scientists are racing to find out more about COVID-19, and our understanding of the virus that causes it and the threat it poses may change as new information becomes available. Based on what we know so far, here's how it compares with the flu.
Symptoms and severity
Both seasonal flu viruses (which include influenza A and influenza B viruses) and COVID-19 are contagious viruses that cause respiratory illness. 
Typical flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, headaches, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue and, sometimes, vomiting and diarrhea, according to the CDC. Flu symptoms often come on suddenly. Most people who get the flu will recover in less than two weeks. But in some people, the flu causes complications, including pneumonia. So far this flu season, about 1% of people in the United States have developed symptoms severe enough to be hospitalized. And the overall hospitalization rate in the U.S. this season is 61 hospitalizations per 100,000 people.
With COVID-19, doctors are still trying to understand the full picture of disease symptoms and severity. Reported symptoms in patients have varied from mild to severe, and can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. 
In general, studies of hospitalized patients have found that about 83% to 98% of patients develop a fever, 76% to 82% develop a dry cough and 11% to 44% develop fatigue or muscle aches, according to a review study on COVID-19 published Feb. 28 in the journal JAMA. Other symptoms, including headache, sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, have been reported, but are less common. A less common symptom, loss of smell, has also been reported in some COVID-19 patients, Live Science reported.
Another recent study, considered the largest on COVID-19 cases to date, researchers from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Protection, analyzed 44,672 confirmed cases in China between Dec. 31, 2019 and Feb. 11, 2020. Of those cases, 80.9% (or 36,160 cases) were considered mild, 13.8% (6,168 cases) severe and 4.7% (2,087) critical. "Critical cases were those that exhibited respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure," the researchers wrote in the paper published in China CDC Weekly.
A recent study of COVID-19 cases in the United States found that, among 4,226 reported cases , at least 508 people, or 12% were hospitalized. However, the study, published March 18 in the CDC journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) is preliminary, and the researchers note that data on hospitalizations were missing for a substantial number of patients.
It's important to note that, because respiratory viruses cause similar symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish different respiratory viruses based on symptoms alone, according to WHO.
Death rate
The death rate from seasonal flu is typically around 0.1% in the U.S., according to The New York Times. 
Though the death rate for COVID-19 is unclear, most research suggests it is higher than that of the seasonal flu.
In the study published Feb. 18 in the China CDC Weekly, researchers found a death rate from COVID-19 to be around 2.3% in mainland China. Another study of about 1,100 hospitalized patients in China, published Feb. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the overall death rate was slightly lower, around 1.4%.
Still, the death rate for COVID-19 appears to vary by location and an individual's age, among other factors. For instance, in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, the death rate reached 2.9%; in other provinces of China, that rate was just 0.4%, according to the China CDC Weekly study. In addition, older adults have been hit the hardest. The death rate soars to 14.8% in those 80 and older; among those ages 70 to 79, the COVID-19 death rate in China seems to be about 8%; it’s 3.6% for those ages 60 to 69; 1.3% for 50 to 59; 0.4% for the age group 40 to 49; and just 0.2% for people ages 10 to 39. No deaths in children under 9 have been reported. 
A report published March 13 in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases adjusted for the potential time delay between hospitalization and death among cases in China. The authors estimated that, as of Feb. 11, the death rate from COVID-19 was as high as 12% in Wuhan, 4% in Hubei Province and 0.9% in the rest of China.
In the CDC's MMWR study, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 80% of deaths associated with COVID-19 were among adults aged 65 years and older.
Virus transmission
The measure scientists use to determine how easily a virus spreads is known as the "basic reproduction number," or R0 (pronounced R-nought). This is an estimate of the average number of people who catch the virus from a single infected person, Live science previously reported. The flu has an R0 value of about 1.3, according to The New York Times.
Researchers are still working to determine the R0 for COVID-19.  Preliminary studies have estimated an R0 value for the new coronavirus to be between 2 and 3, according to the JAMA review study published Feb. 28. This means each infected person has spread the virus to an average of 2 to 3 people.
The CDC estimates that, on average, about 8% of the U.S. population gets sick with the flu each season.
As of March 19, there are 9,415 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. Some parts of the country have higher levels of activity than others, but cases have been reported in all 50 states, according to the CDC.
The immediate risk of being exposed to COVID-19 is still low for most Americans, however, as the outbreak expands, that risk will increase, the CDC said. People who live in areas where there is ongoing community spread are at higher risk of exposure, as are healthcare workers who care for COVID-19 patients, the agency said.
The CDC expects that widespread transmission of the new coronavirus will occur, and in the coming months, most of the U.S. population will be exposed to the virus.
Pandemics
It's important to note that seasonal flu, which causes outbreaks every year, should not be confused with pandemic flu, or a global outbreak of a new flu virus that is very different from the strains that typically circulate. This happened in 2009 with the swine flu pandemic, which is estimated to have killed between 151,000 and 575,000 people worldwide, according to the CDC. There is no flu pandemic happening currently.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. This is the first time WHO has declared a pandemic over a coronavirus.
Unlike seasonal flu, for which there is a vaccine to protect against infection, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. But researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health are in the early stages of developing one. Officials have already launched a phase 1 clinical trial of a potential vaccine for COVID-19.
In general, the CDC recommends the following to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, which include both coronaviruses and flu viruses: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; avoid close contact with people who are sick; stay home when you are sick; and clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Coronavirus in U.S.
Editor's note: This story was updated on at 2:55 pm E.D.T to include a joint statement from a number of societies, including the American Society of Anesthesiologists. It was updated at 5:15 pm E.D.T to note that a hospital in New York City is practicing ventilator sharing.
There aren't enough ventilators in the United States to keep alive the hundreds of thousands of people who will need them during the COVID-19 pandemic. There may be a stopgap, however. 
Doctors can reconfigure existing ventilators so that these lifesaving devices serve either two or four patients simultaneously, rather than just one at a time, according to a 2006 feasibility study in the journal Academic Emergency Medicine.
The study was written in the aftermath of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, but in light of the new coronavirus outbreak, one of the study's authors published a YouTube tutorial to show how this idea could work for patients whose breathing is impaired by the new coronavirus.
"In that study, we just looked at simple equipment available in the emergency department and a way to modify the ventilator to ventilate four patients," study co-author Dr. Charlene Irvin Babcock, an emergency medicine physician at St. John Hospital and Medical Center in Detroit, said in the video.  
Related: Coronavirus in the US: Latest COVID-19 news and case counts
A ventilator is a machine that can help a person breathe by delivering oxygen through a tube placed in the mouth or nose, or through a hole in the front of the neck, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In essence, the study shows that a ventilator can be modified with adapters and T-shaped tubes so that it has four ports for four patients, said Babcock, who co-wrote the study with Dr. Greg Neyman. At the time, Neyman was a resident in emergency medicine at St. John Hospital and Medical Center, and now works as an emergency physician at several hospitals in Hamilton, New Jersey.
But this idea was put to use by Dr. Kevin Menes, an emergency room physician who treated mass shooting victims at the 2017 Las Vegas country music concert. Menes had been a resident with Neyman, so he was aware of the ventilator study. (You can read about Menes' harrowing night at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas here.)
This past week, with the COVID-19 crisis, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan began practicing ventilator sharing, according to The New York Times. For now, the hospital is putting a maximum of two people on a single ventilator. But some people are still getting their own if they have a complex case, Dr. Jeremy Beitler, a pulmonary disease specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia, told The New York Times. 
However, in a statement released today (March 26), medical societies across the country came out strongly against this idea. "Sharing mechanical ventilators should not be attempted because it cannot be done safely with current equipment," the societies said in the statement. "The physiology of patients with COVID‐19‐onset acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is complex." Even in ideal circumstances, 40% to 60% of ventilated patients with ARDS and lung disease die, they said. 
Using the same ventilator for multiple people could spread germs, but in this case, these patients would have COVID-19 already anyway, Babcock noted. In addition, the patients would need to be sedated for this to work, Babcock added in the YouTube comments.
But this setup is designed to be a temporary one, used only when there is a "disaster surge involving multiple casualties with respiratory failure," the researchers wrote in the study. COVID-19 patients typically need artificial ventilation for longer than 12 hours, the amount of time analyzed in the study. And if one patient improves and needs less oxygen, while another worsens and needs more, a ventilator hooked up to two people could not adjust to both of them, as ProPublica reported. Getting too little or too much oxygen can damage the lungs.

Why are deaths from coronavirus so high in Italy?
Italy now has the highest number of deaths from COVID-19 in the world.
People stroll across the Piazza del Duomo, in front of the Duomo, in central Milan, Italy, wearing protective masks amidst the coronavirus outbreak, on Feb. 23, 2020.
Updated on March 26 with new information about COVID-19 in Italy. It was originally published on March 10.
Deaths from the new coronavirus in Italy continue to soar, with the country reporting 919 deaths in a single day on Friday (March 27) — the biggest single-day death toll reported in any country since the start of the outbreak. But why are deaths in Italy  so high?
Italy now has the highest number of deaths in the world from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. As of Friday (March 27), the country had reported more than 9,100 deaths, according to worldometer, a website tracking COVID-19 cases. And the country's fatality rate from COVID-19 — at 10% — is much higher than the global average of 3.4%, according to the World Health Organization. 
One factor affecting the country's death rate may be the age of its population — Italy has the oldest population in Europe, with about 23% of residents 65 or older, according to The New York Times. The median age in the country is 47.3, compared with 38.3 in the United States, the Times reported. Many of Italy's deaths have been among people in their 80s, and 90s, a population known to be more susceptible to severe complications from COVID-19, according to The Local.
What's more, older adults appear to make up a greater proportion of cases in Italy, with about 37% of cases ages 70 and older, compared with 12% of cases in China, according to a paper on the issue of deaths in Italy, published March 23 in the journal JAMA.

—Can people spread the coronavirus after they recover?
The overall mortality rate is always going to depend on the demographics of a population, said Aubree Gordon, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan. In this case, the reported mortality rate is not "age standardized," which is a way to adjust for the underlying demographics of a population, she said.
Given Italy's older population, "you would expect their mortality rate to be higher on average, all else being held equal," compared with a country with a younger population, Gordon told Live Science.
In addition, as people age, the chances of developing at least one condition that weakens their immune system — such as cancer or diabetes — increases, said Krys Johnson, an epidemiologist at the Temple University College of Public Health. Such conditions also make people more susceptible to severe illness from coronavirus, she said.
Another issue may be the number of people in a given area who require medical care — having a lot of severely ill people in a single region could potentially overwhelm the medical system, Gordon said. She noted that this was likely the case in Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began and which saw the majority of COVID-19 cases in China. A recent report from WHO found that the fatality rate was 5.8% in Wuhan, compared with 0.7% in the rest of the country, Live Science previously reported.
Finally, the country may not be catching many of the mild cases of COVID-19. Often, as testing expands within a community, more mild cases are found, which lowers the overall death rate, Gordon said. This was the case in South Korea, which had tested more than 295,000 people as of March 18 and had a death rate of about 1%, according to Business Insider.
"We probably don't know how many people have actually become infected," Johnson said. People with more mild symptoms, or those who are younger, may not be going to get tested, she said. 
Indeed, although Italy initially conducted extensive testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts of people with COVID-19, the Italian Ministry of Health issued more stringent testing policies on Feb. 25, according to the JAMA paper. The policy prioritized testing for people with severe symptoms and limited testing for asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms. This could result in an increase in the fatality rate because patients with more mild symptoms are not getting tested, the paper said. 
Italy has conducted a substantial number of tests — more than 134,000 as of March 17,  according to The New York Times. However there is likely "quite a sizeable outbreak" in the area, which would need even more testing to identify, Gordon said.

That's not very scientific. Who are 'they' and how did they unleash larger amounts of the virus in Italy? Were they basting hand rails with the virus? Is it not more feasible that the virus mutated on it's own like every other virus that humans pick up. Misinformation is manmade ya big uneducated guesser.

Treatments for COVID-19: Drugs being tested against the coronavirus
Several drugs are in various stages of being tested as treatments for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
The world is now desperate to find ways to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus and to find effective treatments. As of Friday (March 20), 86 clinical trials of COVID-19 treatments or vaccines that are either ongoing or recruiting patients. New ones are being added every day, as the case count in the U.S. (and globally) skyrockets. The drugs being tested range from repurposed flu treatments to failed ebola drugs, to malaria treatments that were first developed decades ago. Here, we take a look at several of the treatments that doctors hope will help fight COVID-19.
Japan flu drug
A drug developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical in Japan is showing promising outcomes in treating at least mild to moderate cases of COVID-19, Live Science previously reported.
The antiviral drug, called Favipiravir or Avigan, has been used in Japan to treat influenza, and last month, the drug was approved as an experimental treatment for COVID-19 infections, Pharmaceutical Technology reported.
The drug, which works by preventing certain viruses from replicating, seemed to shorten the duration of the virus as well as improve lung conditions (as seen in X-rays) in tested patients, though the research has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed science journal. 
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, but preliminary research in human and primate cells suggests that the drugs could effectively treat COVID-19.
A 2005 study found that chloroquine could quell the spread of SARS-CoV when applied to infected human cells in culture. SARS-CoV is closely related to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002. Chloroquine disrupts the ability of the SARS-CoV virus to enter and replicate in human cells, Live Science previously reported. The cell culture studies of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the drug and its derivative hydroxychloroquine undermine the novel virus' replication in a similar way. 
Doctors in China, South Korea, France and the U.S. are now giving the drug to some patients with COVID-19 with promising, albeit anecdotal, results so far. The FDA is organizing a formal clinical trial of the drug. 
As of Feb. 23, seven clinical trials had been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry to test whether COVID-19 infections could be treated with hydroxychloroquine. In addition, the University of Minnesota is studying whether taking hydroxychloroquine can protect people living with infected COVID-19 patients from catching the virus themselves. 
In one heavily referenced study, conducted in France, a small number of patients with COVID-19 received either hydroxychloroquine alone or hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic called azithromycin. The authors reported that detectable concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 fell significantly faster in the study participants than coronavirus patients at other French hospitals who did not receive either drug. In six patients also given azithromycin, this promising effect appeared to be amplified. 
However, the CDC noted that the small, non-randomized study "did not assess clinical benefit[s]" associated with the treatment; in other words, the study did not probe whether the treated patients were more likely to recover and survive their illness. Additionally, the agency advised that doctors should be cautious when giving either drug to patients with chronic disease, such as kidney failure, and especially those "who are receiving medications that might interact to cause arrhythmias."
A Gilead Sciences drug that was originally tested in people with Ebola, remdesivir, is being repurposed to see if it can effectively treat COVID-19. 
The drug was found not to be effective in Ebola, but in lab studies, it has proven effective at inhibiting the growth of similar viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In a petri dish, remdesivir can prevent human cells from becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, according to a letter published in the journal Nature in February.
The Food and Drug Administration has currently approved use of remdesivir for compassionate use, meaning only patients with severe COVID-19 disease can be approved for treatment. In other countries, requirements to receive remdesivir may be less stringent.
Five clinical trials in China and the U.S. are currently evaluating whether remdesevir can reduce complications or shorten the disease course in COVID-19 patients, the medical news site STAT reported. 
"There's only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy," Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization said last month, as reported by STAT. "And that's remdesivir."
George Thompson, an infectious disease specialist at UC Davis Medical Center who treated an early, severe case of COVID-19, told Science magazine that their patient got better after getting the drug, about 36 hours after diagnosis. The doctors initially thought the patient would die, Thompson said.
However, such anecdotal evidence can't demonstrate effectiveness, and the lab has yet to analyze blood samples to show that the patient's clinical improvement following the administration of remdesivir coincided with a drop in viral load (concentration of viral particles). On the flip side, a study posted to the preprint database medRXiv looked at three patients treated with remdesivir. The study, which was not peer-reviewed, found no clear time-dependent relationship between getting the drug and seeing improvements in symptoms. The patients also experienced rectal bleeding, elevated liver enzymes, vomiting and nausea, which could potentially be tied to the drug.
Another quandary is that antiviral drugs generally work better the earlier patients get them, but because remdesivir is not FDA-approved for general use, only patients with the most severe, and late-stage, disease, qualify for its use in clinical trials, Thompson told Science.
A total of 199 people with low oxygen levels were randomized to either receive kaletra or a placebo. While fewer people taking kaletra died, the difference was not statistically significant, meaning it could have been due to random chance. And both groups had similar levels of virus in their blood over time.
However, other studies are still ongoing, and there's still a possibility this combination could show some benefit. As with other antivirals, this drug would likely work better if given earlier in the disease course.
For some patients with COVID-19, the virus itself doesn't do the worst damage. Rather, in some people their immune system goes into overdrive and launches an all-out assault known as a cytokine storm. That immune overreaction can damage tissue and ultimately kill people.
To quiet such cytokine storms, doctors are now trying an immunosuppressant known as Actemra, or tocilizumab. The drug is approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. It blocks a cell receptor that binds something called interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 is a cytokine, or a type of protein released by the immune system, that can trigger dangerous inflammatory cascades.
On March 19, pharmaceutical company Roche announced that it was launching a trial to see if tocilizumab could improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. One group will receive the drug plus other standard treatments, while another group will receive a placebo, plus standard treatments. 
Regeneron is enrolling patients in a clinical trial to test another IL-6 inhibitor, known as sarilumab (kevzara), for treating COVID-19 pneumonia. The logic behind using sarilumab is similar to that for tocilizumab.
Losartan is a generic blood-pressure medication that some scientists are hoping could help patients with COVID-19. The University of Minnesota has launched two clinical trials using the inexpensive, generic drug. The first would evaluate whether losartan can prevent multi-organ failure in those hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. The second would evaluate if the drug can prevent hospitalizations in the first place, Reuters reported.
Losartan works by blocking a receptor, or doorway into cells that the chemical called angiotensin II uses to enter the cells and raise blood pressure. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and it's possible, the thinking goes, that because losartan might block those receptors, it may prevent the virus from infecting cells. 
Complicating things, a paper published March 11 in the journal The Lancet has raised the possibility that common drugs for hypertension, such as ACE inhibitors and so-called angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which includes losartan, might actually spur the body to make more ACE2, thereby increasing the ability of the virus to infiltrate cells. A recent study of 355 COVID-19 patients in Italy (study in Italian) found that three-quarters of the patients who died had hypertension, and the authors propose this is one reason for their increased susceptibility.

Can people spread coronavirus after they recover?
Coronavirus may linger in the body for weeks after people recover.
Doctors look at a lung CT image at a hospital in Yunmeng county, Xiaogan city, in China's central Hubei province in Feb. 20, 2020.
A small study out of China suggests that the new coronavirus can persist in the body for at least two weeks after symptoms of the disease clear up. 
This sort of persistence isn't unheard of among viruses, experts told Live Science, and thankfully, the patients are most likely not very contagious in the post-symptom period. The findings may even be good news, said Krys Johnson, an epidemiologist at Temple University's College of Public Health. The viruses that tend to hang around in people's systems also tend to be the viruses that the body develops a strong immune response against. 
"If the virus is staying in people's systems, then they may not be able to be reinfected," Johnson told Live Science.

After coronavirus 
The new study, published in the journal JAMA on Thursday (Feb. 27), followed four medical professionals ages 30 to 36 years old who developed COVID-19 (the disease caused by the new coronavirus) and were treated at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital in China between Jan. 1 and Feb. 15. All of the individuals recovered, and only one was hospitalized during the illness. The patients were treated with oseltamivir, better known under the brand name of Tamiflu, an antiviral drug. 
The patients were considered recovered after their symptoms resolved and after they tested negative for COVID-19 twice (on two consecutive days). After recovery, the patients were asked to quarantine themselves at home for five days. They continued to undergo throat swabs for the coronavirus after five days for up to 13 days post-recovery.  
The results showed that every test between Day 5 and Day 13 was positive for the virus. 
"These findings suggest that at least a proportion of recovered patients still may be virus carriers," the researchers wrote. 
The findings come as Japan reported its first case of an individual who recovered from coronavirus and then became ill with the disease for a second time, according to Reuters. Given the new results on post-coronavirus persistence from China, it's not clear what happened with the Japanese patient, Johnson said. One possibility is that she caught a new version of the virus from another person; another possibility is that her own system did not fight off the virus completely and as it began to replicate inside her lungs again, she experienced a resurgence of symptoms. 
Low-level viruses 
It is not uncommon for viruses to persist at low levels in the body even after someone recovers from an illness, said Ebenezer Tumban, a virologist at Michigan Tech University. For example, Zika virus and Ebola virus are known to stick around for months after patients recover, Johnson noted. 
The test that the four patients from Wuhan, China, underwent looks for genetic fragments of the virus in the body, Tumban said. The Tamiflu they were taking could have pushed the number of viral copies in their bodies down to just a few, he said. At that point, the test would not have been sensitive enough to detect the virus. 
After the antiviral treatment ended, the viruses may have begun replicating again at a low level, Tumban said. There would not have been enough of the virus to cause tissue damage, so the patients felt no symptoms. But the number of viral copies would have gotten high enough for the test to catch them again. 
At that point, the individuals were likely not very contagious, Johnson said. Coughing and sneezing spews viral particles around, but these individuals were not coughing or sneezing. Their viral loads were also low. It would take more intimate contact to spread the virus. 
Immunity implications 
None of the study patients' family members tested positive for coronavirus at the time of the paper's publication. However, the authors noted that the patients were all medical professionals who took very careful precautions to avoid spreading the disease while at home. 
Virus that persists in the body may elicit enough of an immune response to provide some protection against new infection, Johnson said. There are many questions about how long immunity would last, though, Tumban said. For example, the body maintains immunity against the coronaviruses that cause the common cold for only a year or two, he said. And there is always the possibility that the new coronavirus would mutate as it moves through populations, changing into a version that already-exposed immune systems can't recognize. 
More follow-up studies are needed to understand recovery from COVID-19, Johnson said. The individuals in the study from Wuhan were all of similar age and health status, and none experienced severe illness from COVID-19. 
Future research should also look at viral loads within the lungs, Tumban said. A throat swab captures the virus only from the upper reaches of the respiratory tract, but the virus makes its home deep in the lungs. Sampling from the lungs is a more invasive procedure, involving washing fluid through the alveoli (small air sacs in the lungs) and testing that fluid for viral particles, Tumban said. Still, the study suggests that long-term monitoring of recovered patients and their contacts is important.
"One week or two weeks after, is the amount of virus in the blood or lungs going to come up to a higher concentration so that the person can transmit it to other people?" Tumban said. "That's something that we still don't know."

In one of the more unusual incidents being attributed to the new coronavirus outbreak, a turf war between dozens of street monkeys and temple monkeys broke out in Thailand's historic city of Lopburi on Thursday (March 12). According to city residents, the furry fracas likely resulted from a sharp dip in tourism to the 800-year-old city — and thus a dip in free food offerings to thousands of local monkeys.
"It’s the summer so usually we see a lot of tourists, but now because of the outbreak there's so few that the markets are very quiet," Sasaluk Rattanachai, who posted a video of the brawl online, told Thai news site Khaosod English. "Not enough tourists come to leave food for the monkeys at [the temple]."
About 39 million tourists visited Thailand last year, according to the BBC. more than 10 million of those tourists were Chinese. Ongoing travel bans in China (and increasingly around the world) have seriously hampered Thailand's tourism industry.
What a nightmarish scene! I can't help thinking of human behavior during this pandemic, such as the massive hoarding of food and supplies!

Coronavirus in U.S.
Has half the UK already caught COVID-19? Probably not.
On March 24, a headline in the Financial Times proclaimed that "Coronavirus may have infected half of UK population," suggesting that many people in the region may have already recovered from and developed some immunity to COVID-19.
The news article focused on a new study from the University of Oxford, which has not been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal. The study authors collected available data about deaths tied to the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, reported in both the United Kingdom and Italy, and used these numbers to model how the virus might have spread through the U.K. so far. 
In one hypothetical scenario, the authors estimated that viral transmission began 38 days before the first recorded death in the U.K., which took place March 5. They found that, given this start date, 68% of the population would have been infected by March 19. This statistic made headlines in the Financial Times, and later, outlets like the Evening Standard, Daily Mail and The Sun, according to Wired U.K. 
To begin, the authors write that their overall approach "rests on the assumption that only a very small proportion of the population is at risk of hospitabitable illness." In their most extreme model, the authors estimate that just 0.1% of the population, or one in every 1,000 people, will require hospitalization.
"We can already see just by looking at Italy ... that that figure has already been exceeded," Tim Colbourn, an epidemiologist at University College London’s Institute for Global Health, told Wired U.K. In the region of Lombardy alone, more than one in 1,000 people have been hospitalized, and that number continues to grow every day, Wired U.K. reported.

"The work models one of the most important questions — how far has the infection really spread — in the total absence of any direct data," wrote James Wood, head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge, who researches infection dynamics and disease control. While the paper poses an important question, the assumptions underlying the model leave the authors' conclusions "open to gross over interpretation by others," Wood said.      
"As far as I can tell, the model ... assumes that all those infected, whether they are asymptomatic, mildly ill or severely ill are equally infectious to others," Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, wrote on the Science Media Centre site. "This is almost certainly false." Data suggest that asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic people may actually fuel the rapid spread of COVID-19. 
In addition, the model assumes that the U.K. population would become "completely mixed" over time, meaning any given individual has an equal chance of running into another within the region, Hunter wrote. "We do not all have an equal random chance of meeting every other person in the U.K., infected or otherwise," he said. Without some acknowledgement of the structure of social networks within the U.K.; the relative risk of running into a mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic person; and the risk of severe infection tied to different demographics, the simplified model "should not be given much credibility," Hunter said.
The U.K. needs to determine how many people have already been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to shape public health policy going forward. This feat can be accomplished with widespread serological testing (blood tests), which would reveal who has antibodies to the novel coronavirus circulating in their blood. The U.K. has ordered 3.5 million antibody tests and must now validate the kits before selling them to the public, Wired U.K. previously reported.
"As the authors say [in their paper], a proper test will come from serological surveys — which will tell us how many people have been exposed," Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh wrote on the Science Media Centre. If data gathered through serological testing does support the Oxford model, it would have "huge implications," Woolhouse added. For instance, the finding would suggest that many people in the U.K. now have immunity against COVID-19, which would help break the chains of viral transmission to those who are still vulnerable. This phenomenon is known as herd immunity. 
"It would imply that the main reason why COVID-19 epidemics peak is the build-up of herd immunity," he wrote. "Though that would not change current policy in the UK, which is focused [on] reducing the short-term impact of the epidemic on the [National Health Service], it would change enormously our long-term expectations making a second wave significantly less likely and raising the possibility that the public health threat of COVID-19 will diminish all around the world in the coming months."

Coronavirus in U.S.
How far could the new coronavirus spread?
The transmissibility of the virus depends on many factors, some of which remain unknown.
With every passing moment, another breaking report about the newfound coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, hits your news feed. So far, more than 7,700 cases of the virus have been confirmed, including more than 100 cases beyond China.
But one vital question is on many people's minds: How far will the virus spread? 
It can be maddeningly difficult to pin the answer down to a question like this, because the epidemic's extent will depend on a number of factors, including when infected individuals become contagious, how long they remain contagious and how long the virus can survive outside a human host.
However, one estimate predicts that the total number of infections in five major Chinese cities — Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chongqing — will peak between late April and early May, according to a model developed by researchers at The University of Hong Kong. During this period, as many as 150,000 new cases may be reported in Chongqing each day due to the city's large population and the volume of travel from Wuhan to Chongqing, the team reported. The same model predicts that the number of people showing symptoms in Wuhan will spike to more than 50,000 by this upcoming weekend. Of course, things are changing rapidly, and the model’s estimates rely on many unknowns. 
Some disease transmission has already taken place beyond Chinese borders, specifically in Germany. As the illness has been reported in 22 countries so far, additional international transmission may be inevitable, but whether the outbreak will reach epidemic levels remains to be seen. To answer that question, scientists are working to determine how quickly the virus can spread between people and at what stage the disease is most transmissible. 
Also known as the "basic reproduction number," R0 predicts the number of people who can catch a given bug from a single infected person. For example, diseases such as polio, smallpox and rubella have R0 values in the 5 to 7 range; such values mean that, on average, one sick person would be likely to infect five to seven people who were not resistant to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The measles virus ranks among the most highly transmissible diseases on the planet, with an estimated R0 value of 12 to 18.    
As Chinese health officials confirmed more and more cases of 2019-nCoV, scientists around the world rushed to estimate R0 for the new virus. Last week, several reports placed the figure between 2 and 3, while the World Health Organization reported that the virus's R0 falls slightly lower, at between 1.4 and 2.5. Other estimates have surpassed this range, hovering above 3.5. But what do all these numbers really mean? 
For context, know that diseases with an R0 below 1 typically disappear from a population before becoming widespread, as infected people recover faster than the bug can be transmitted to new hosts. "In general, you want an R0 below 1; that's how you know the disease is under control," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a news briefing held Monday (Jan. 27). An R0 above 1 suggests that a given disease will continue to spread, but the number doesn't reveal how quickly transmission will take place.
Related: Going viral: 6 new findings about viruses 
Remember that R0 represents the average number of people that could be infected by a single contagious person; that seemingly straightforward number can reflect a variety of scenarios. An infection might ripple through a population in even waves, with each diseased person infecting a similar number of people. Alternatively, transmission might occur in sudden spurts, with a few so-called superspreaders passing on the infection to many people at once while other infected individuals recover before infecting anyone at all. 
In the early days of an outbreak, scientists cannot map these transmission patterns in detail, because they have too few data points. Such is the case with 2019-nCoV. "The cases that have been identified skew to the severe … How does this skew our understanding of the virus?" Alex Azar, U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, said during a news briefing on Tuesday (Jan. 28).   
What's more, R0 estimates vary from location to location, as disease transmission depends on how often people in the affected area come into contact with each other and how prevalent infection is in a given population. The current estimates for  2019-nCoV are specific to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the ongoing outbreak. 
R0 values also depend on characteristics of the infection itself, including how long infected people remain contagious, whether asymptomatic people can pass on the disease and how long the bug can survive outside the body, according to a study published in the January 2019 issue of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. 
Chinese health officials reported isolated cases of disease transmission from asymptomatic people, but the CDC has not yet reviewed this data or verified the conclusion, CDC Director Robert Redfield said during the news briefing on Jan. 28. But even if asymptomatic transmission can occur, "an epidemic is not driven by asymptomatic carriers," added Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Historically, symptomatic carriers "shed" far more of the virus than asymptomatic people during outbreaks of respiratory infection, he said. 
An international outbreak?  
Scientists will continue to refine the R0 estimate for 2019-nCoV as more data rolls in from around the world. Regardless of the final calculation, however, the new virus has already hopped aboard several international flights and spread far beyond Chinese borders.
To prevent 2019-nCoV from spreading further, countries such as the U.S., Australia and the U.K. are screening travelers coming from China and quarantining those with potential infections. This week, the CDC announced that its screening efforts will be expanded to cover 20 airports. In addition, health officials will monitor both infected people and their close contacts in order to identify more cases and better understand how the disease progresses over time. 
For those traveling home from China, passengers seated next to the window may be the least likely to pick up the virus from an infected person onboard, as people in the window seat move about the cabin less often and come into contact with fewer people passing in the aisles, according to National Geographic. People seated in the same row as an infected person, however, stand the highest risk of infection.Imported goods from China should not carry infectious strains of the virus, especially given that most coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for only a matter of hours, Messonnier said on Monday (Jan. 27). "There's no evidence to support the transmission of this virus through imported goods," she said. 
Related: The 9 deadliest viruses on Earth
"While the vast majority of Americans will not have exposure, some will," Messonnier added during the Jan. 28 news briefing. Health care workers stand the greatest risk of being exposed to the virus, but with only five confirmed cases nationwide, the threat of infection remains low for most Americans, she said. 
Since the start of the outbreak, the new virus has claimed 170 lives in China and infected more than 7,700 people worldwide. The true lethality and transmissibility of the virus will become clear in time, and meanwhile, health officials will continue developing diagnostics, therapeutics and preventative countermeasures to fight the disease. The average person can lower their risk of infection by washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing or sneezing, and staying home when ill.    
In the words of the CDC's Redfield, "Everyone has a role to play to help contain the spread of this virus."

Coronavirus in U.S.
Confusion and chaos surround coronavirus testing in the US
Her symptoms didn't feel like a "normal" cold or flu. 
A couple of days ago, Caitlin Sweeney, a 34-year-old woman who lives in Brooklyn, New York, developed a dry cough, a sore throat, fatigue and slight nasal congestion. Sweeney, who is 22 weeks pregnant, worried that some of her symptoms, such as her dry cough, resembled those of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.
The number of COVID-19 cases in New York City is rising, so even though her symptoms were mild, she decided to seek medical advice. But when Sweeney called her primary care doctor, she became one of many people thrown into the confusion and frustration clouding COVID-19 testing across the country.
"The receptionist seemed to have no idea what to do about coronavirus and told Caitlin to go to urgent care instead," Sweeney's wife, Natalie Wolchover, told Live Science. (Wolchover used to be a writer at Live Science, and she is now a senior writer and editor for Quanta Magazine.)
Related: 13 coronavirus myths busted by science
So Sweeney called a nearby urgent care clinic. Staff members at the clinic told her they didn't have any way to do coronavirus tests and recommended she visit an emergency room instead. So Sweeney and Wolchover went to a nearby ER, where they were told that Sweeney's symptoms didn't meet the criteria for coronavirus testing. Namely, she didn't have liquid in her lungs, which could have indicated a more severe infection, and she didn't have a fever. 
Sweeney's doctor said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines require a fever to do a test. (But not all patients with COVID-19 have a fever, even though that's one of the main symptoms associated with the disease). Moreover, only patients who have severe symptoms and have to be intubated — in which a tube is inserted into the body to help with breathing — are given coronavirus tests, the doctor said.
Instead, Sweeney was given a flu test, which was negative, and some cough drops and was sent home, Wolchover said. The doctor "was very apologetic about not being able to give Caitlin a test," she added. "She assured Caitlin that her lack of fever meant the baby wasn't in danger."
Dozens of similar anecdotes have been floating around Twitter and other social media platforms over the past couple of weeks. These people have found themselves in a similar situation: They had symptoms that they thought could be indicative of COVID-19, yet they were denied testing for it.
The reason is simple: There are not enough tests in the U.S. for everybody who may have COVID-19. But there has been a lot of mixed messaging from the government, media reports, social media and even employers on testing for the virus.
Currently, 78 state and local health labs in the United States have the capacity to test people for COVID-19, the CDC announced yesterday (March 10).
That means about 75,000 people can get tested — far fewer than the 1.5 million tests the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pledged the U.S. would roll out by the end of last week. However, the numbers can be misleading; some labs are running two tests per person, according to The Atlantic.
States vary widely in their ability to test patients for COVID-19. California can test about 7,400 people a day, Washington can test 1,000 and Oregon can only test 40, an analysis by The Atlantic found. In total, the U.S. has tested a couple thousand people; by comparison, South Korea can test about 10,000 people every day.
The problem is that testing in the U.S. had a rough start. The first test developed by the CDC to diagnose COVID-19 turned out to deliver inconclusive results, which "left the nation with minimal diagnostic capacity during the first few weeks of the epidemic," according to a perspective article published March 9 in the journal JAMA. 
Related: How does the coronavirus test work?
Initially, the CDC also limited testing to a very narrow group of people who had known exposure to COVID-19, meaning a person needed to have traveled to an affected area or been in contact with someone who had to be considered for testing. This strategy soon proved ineffective as evidence appeared that the virus had been spreading in U.S. communities. "In the early stages, COVID-19 has spread beyond the nation's ability to detect it," the authors wrote in the JAMA paper.
On Feb. 29, the FDA announced that it would allow labs across the country to begin testing for the novel coronavirus with their own lab-developed tests without prior approval, as long as the labs took basic steps to validate the tests and submitted an "emergency use authorization" (EUA) application within 15 days of the notice.
An EUA is a permission given by the FDA to use a drug or device that hasn't been FDA approved in times of declared emergencies. The New York State Laboratory has already received such an EUA to test for the new coronavirus, and other labs are expected to begin testing soon, according to the JAMA paper. "It is anticipated that testing will be far more available nationwide by mid-March," the authors wrote.
But more testing is not always better, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, lead author of the JAMA paper and a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. For example, a person might go to the ER, wanting a test because they've been exposed to someone with COVID-19, but the test may turn up negative because the virus hasn't duplicated to detectable levels in their body yet. Or, a person thinking they might have the coronavirus but don't, might come in asking for a test and increase their risk of actually getting it by going to a hospital, he said. 
In the setting of "high demand and low supply" of tests, decisions have to be made on how to best use those tests, Sharfstein told Live Science. "I think that we will have plenty of time to figure out what went wrong," he said. "The focus now has to be on managing the situation that we're in." 
That means increasing testing capacity and supporting social distancing — a tactic to keep people from interacting closely or frequently — to reduce the spread of the virus. In the next couple of weeks, ideally, the U.S. would settle into a situation where medical professionals would be able to spot individual cases relatively quickly and stop these people from infecting others, Sharfstein said. 
Technically, Sweeney's doctor could have tested her if her symptoms warranted testing. The decision of whether to test someone for COVID-19 is now under doctors' discretion, according to recent announcements from the CDC and Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the outbreak.

However, despite these guidelines for doctors, "tests aren't really available," said Dr. Eric Cioe-Peña, an emergency room physician and the director of global health at Northwell Health in New York. So, really, they're "transferring liability onto us without giving us the resources," he said.
With a shortage of test kits, most doctors would likely not use them for people with mild symptoms, he said. "We definitely had patients come in expecting tests; they've been told they could get a test" for COVID-19, Cioe-Peña added. "I think there have been lots of mixed messages" from the government, experts on TV, news reports, social media and employers, he added.
There are some employers, for example, that have been asking their employees to be tested for COVID-19 before coming to work "which again, creates fear and false expectations" Cioe-Peña said. Most of those healthy people won't be given a coronavirus test when they go and ask for it. 
Rather, testing priority is for patients in intensive care units who have severe respiratory distress and require a lot of support, those who need to be admitted to the hospital for other reasons, those traveling from countries that have been affected heavily by the new coronavirus or those in contact with confirmed cases, Cioe-Peña said.
Still, Northwell Health, with its own lab-made tests, is one of the first private labs in New York to be able to do testing on their own. However, Northwell Health's labs serve 23 hospitals and 800 facilities and can run only 80 to 90 tests a day, he added.
Related: How to self-quarantine during the coronavirus outbreak
Technicians conduct those tests manually — something that also takes time, Cioe-Peña said. Northwell Health is currently working on developing a semiautomated or fully automated way to conduct the tests in the lab so that they can hasten the process, he added.
Eventually, as more tests become available, it will be important to test even mild cases so doctors and health officials can track the number of cases and figure out whether the numbers have started decreasing, he added. Currently, he said, officials know cases are increasing in New York City. 
Testing wouldn't change treatment for people with mild symptoms, and these people should just recover from home for now, he said. If patients develop more-serious symptoms, such as breathing difficulties — or they are concerned about a risk factor, such as an underlying disease — they should call their doctor or local ER before going in, Cioe-Peña said.
But these guidelines have not been very clear to the general public. "I don't think it's fair to blame a person frustrated in urgent care," Cioe-Peña said. In communicating with the public, the government should have been much more specific about who can be tested for COVID-19, he added.
Hospital staff told Sweeney that if her symptoms became more severe, she shouldn't come back to the hospital but instead call her primary care doctor. But considering the doctor's office wasn't helpful over the phone, Wolchover said, they don't know what they'll do if Sweeney's symptoms worsen. Thankfully, Sweeney seems to be doing better, Wolchover said.

Two Emergency Physicians in Critical Condition
Today we received word that two of our ACEP members are in critical condition as a result of COVID-19. An emergency physician in his 40s in the state of Washington presented with symptoms consistent with the COVID-19 syndrome. A 70-year-old member in New Jersey has tested positive for the virus. I am deeply saddened by this news, but not surprised. As emergency physicians, we know the risks of our calling. We stand united with our colleagues and our thoughts and prayers for a full and speedy recovery are with each of them and their families. 
In Washington, whether this was a case of occupational transmission or community-based spread of the disease is unknown. The hospital was acutely aware of the COVID-19 risk to health care workers and has worked closely with the CDC to ensure the appropriate policies and procedures are in place to mitigate risk. This emergency physician complied at all times with appropriate PPE procedures.
In Patterson, NJ, the physician, who leads his institution’s emergency preparedness, was admitted to the hospital several days ago with upper respiratory problems and remains in isolation in its intensive care unit.
It is my hope that these colleagues and their cases serve as a reminder to each of us to stay vigilant. This virus is dangerous, and its impact is still unfolding. As emergency physicians, we answer the call to care for our most vulnerable, even at great personal risk. Knowing that, I urge each of you to meticulously follow the recommended precautions to protect yourself.
Rest assured ACEP will continue working tirelessly at the national level to ensure our members are safe. We remain in contact with CDC, Congress, regulatory agencies and other key decision-makers to do all we can to protect patients, physicians and emergency personnel.

College Board Cancels May SAT in Response to the Coronavirus
Stocks plunge 12% as coronavirus shuts down businesses
The U.S. stock market suffered its biggest single-day drop since the 1987 crash Monday as the coronavirus pandemic severely disrupted American life and forced investors to confront fears that a recession may already be underway.
A key reason: Investors realize that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. economic growth, is expected to fall abruptly as the coronavirus outbreak prompts job cuts, cancels events, shuts gathering places and pushes people into their homes.
President Trump said Monday that the virus outbreak could last until August or later, and that “it may be” that the nation already is in a recession. But, he said, “we’re not thinking in terms of recession, we’re thinking in terms of the virus.”
The virus’ business impact is particularly acute in areas such as Los Angeles, where bars and nightclubs have been ordered to close and restaurants can’t host diners until at least March 31 in order to curb the virus’ spread.
Monday’s nosedive came despite the Federal Reserve’s emergency cut in its benchmark interest rate to near zero and other actions Sunday intended to stabilize the markets and keep credit available to businesses.
Prices stabilized for much of the session and then sank again in the final hour as Trump and other government officials fielded questions about the pandemic.
“The reason the stock market is down again is that there’s still a lot we don’t know about the virus and its economic impact” except that “now a recession is all but guaranteed,” McBride said.
The Fed’s moves, he said, were to “make sure markets continue to function properly” and ensure businesses have access to credit, because “if credit markets seize up, a health crisis quickly morphs into a financial crisis.”
Although many of the closed retailers and other businesses have said they’ll keep paying their employees, about 4.4 million U.S. jobs in the leisure and hospitality industries — including bars and restaurants — are at risk, the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. said Monday.
J. Keith Buchanan, a portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, said that as investors keep hearing of additional store closures and other cuts that could jeopardize employment, “they realize the situation becomes darker every day.”
“What worries the market is the prospect of that [economic slowdown] becoming more widespread,” Buchanan said. With consumer spending “now in the crosshairs” of the pandemic, the threat of lower corporate earnings and a recession increases, he said. “That’s why the stock market is really taking it on the chin and giving back its gains of the last year in very short order.”
Concurrent with the virus’ spread has been a plunge in oil prices, spurred both by an expected drop in consumer demand and by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Crude oil on U.S. markets skidded an additional 9.5% on Monday to $28.70 a barrel.
Even the stock of Amazon.com, which has seen a surge of online orders in recent days amid the virus-induced turmoil, has tumbled 14% in the last two weeks.
“Investors invest because they want a cut of the action” of growing corporate profits and a growing economy, “and consumer spending represents 70% of that economy,” Stovall said. “So, 70% of your earnings potential is affected by the virus, but the problem is you don’t know by how much.”
The market “can’t tell you just how pervasive this virus will become, and it can’t tell you how effective the responses will be from the government, whether it’s fiscal or monetary policy,” Buchanan said.
Paulsen said the market’s inability to get a grasp on the extent of the virus’ effect is evident in the “massive volatility going on,” with the Dow moving 9% or more up and down in the last three sessions.
“There’s a lot the market doesn’t know,” he said. “The market’s not perfect on telling you what corporate earnings are going to do, or what interest rates are going to do, let alone what’s going to happen with a pandemic.”
The economists said they revised the forecast after incorporating a review of how the 1957-58 H2N2 influenza pandemic affected the U.S. economy.
The year started solidly, but the forecast predicted that the virus’ rapid effects would slow economic growth in the current quarter to a rate of 0.4% and that the economy would shrink at a 6.5% rate in the second quarter and a 1.9% rate in the third quarter.
Assuming the pandemic ends this summer and supply chains are restored, the forecast predicts the resumption of normal economic activity and a growth rate of 4% in the fourth quarter.
California is expected to shed more than 280,000 of its payroll jobs, with leisure, hospitality and transportation sector jobs accounting for more than one-third of those. That would drive up the unemployment rate to 6.3% by the end of this year, with effects continuing into 2021, when unemployment is expected to average 6.6%.

The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which began in December 2019, presents a significant challenge for the entire world. The UK government and devolved administrations, including the health and social care system, have planned extensively over the years for an event like this. The UK is therefore well prepared to respond in a way that offers substantial protection to the public.

Coronavirus (COVID-19): drivers’ hours relaxations
Coronavirus (COVID-19): guidance on drivers’ hours relaxations
Emergency relaxations
Health and safety legislation
This page tells you about drivers’ hours rules during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. It will be updated if anything changes.
This document provides further advice on the relaxation of drivers’ hours rules, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. This document should be considered in conjunction with the extensive existing guidance provided on drivers’ hours.
The drivers’ hours and working time rules are in place to protect road safety and the working conditions of drivers and to reduce the risk of drivers being involved in fatigue-related accidents. As such, any relaxation of these rules should only be considered where genuinely necessary and when other supply chain management interventions are unable to alleviate issues. The Department for Transport wishes to make clear that driver safety must not be compromised. Drivers should not be expected to drive whilst tired - employers remain responsible for the health and safety of their employees and other road users.
Emergency relaxations
Both the GB and EU drivers’ hours rules automatically cease to apply in emergency situations where immediate preventative action is needed to avoid, amongst other things, danger to the life or health of people. The definition of an emergency is contained in domestic legislation (The Drivers’ Hours (Goods Vehicles) (Exemptions) Regulations 1986 and the Drivers’ Hours (Passenger Vehicles) (Exemptions) Regulations 1970).
The department’s advice about emergency situations is if your journey is necessary to enable someone to:
1) provide goods or services to protect public health, and/or
3) provide medical treatment
and there is a risk of danger to the life or health of people if your journey is not carried out; then you should make use of the emergency exemption.
Operators do not need to ask the department for a temporary ‘urgent’ exemption for these type of journeys. The emergency exemptions cease to apply once the situation is under control and there is no longer a need for immediate preventative action.
The relevant provisions of the Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations 2005 will not apply, to the extent that they conflict with the requirements of responding to the emergency. Drivers will, however, remain subject to all other requirements of the Working Time Regulations in an emergency event.
If a journey doesn’t fall under the emergency provisions the drivers’ hours rules must be complied with. If the situation is still urgent and an operator believes a temporary relaxation of the drivers’ hours rules would be applicable, they should contact in the first instance an organisation representative of their part of the broader supply chain. Temporary, urgent relaxations will only be put in place on a systematic basis and only when other measures in the supply chain cannot be used.
for the drivers of vehicles involved in the delivery of food, non-food (personal care and household paper and cleaning), over the counter pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies when undertaking certain journeys, between 20 March and 3 April in England, Scotland and Wales
Health and safety legislation
As well as the drivers’ hours and working time rules, transport operators, as employers, are required, so far as is reasonably practicable, to ensure the health and safety of their employees while at work and others who may be put at risk by their work activities. In addition, they have a legal duty as an employer to manage risks from fatigue.
That is why when the department does relax the drivers’ hours and working time rules we remind operators, in our notification of the relaxation, that as employers, they remain responsible for the health and safety of their drivers and other road users and that they must ensure that driver safety is not compromised by expecting them to drive whilst tired.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) have issued advice on managing the risks of fatigue and this includes good practice advice on shift lengths. HSE guidance on managing shift work advises that employers should avoid shifts that are longer than 8 hours where work is demanding, safety critical or monotonous and that they should limit shifts to a maximum of 12 hours (including overtime). It also advises that they should encourage and promote the benefit of frequent and regular breaks to reduce the risk of fatigue.

those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service. If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999

COVID-19: guidance on shielding and protecting people defined on medical grounds as extremely vulnerable
Public Health
Guidance on shielding and protecting people defined on medical grounds as extremely vulnerable from COVID-19
How do these measures differ from the social distancing guidance for vulnerable people issued?
Symptoms
What should you do if you develop symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)?
What should you do if you have hospital and GP appointments during this period?
This guidance is for people, including children, who are at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) because of an underlying health condition, and for their family, friends and carers. It is intended for use in situations where the extremely vulnerable person is living in their own home, with or without additional support. This includes the extremely clinically vulnerable people living in long-term care facilities, either for the elderly or persons with special needs.
Shielding is a measure to protect people who are clinically extremely vulnerable by minimising all interaction between those who are extremely vulnerable and others. We are strongly advising people with serious underlying health conditions (listed below), which put them at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19), to rigorously follow shielding measures in order to keep themselves safe.
people having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors
People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly increase the risk of infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell).
Women who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired.
If you think you fall into one of the categories of extremely vulnerable people listed above and you have not received a letter by Sunday 29 March 2020 or been contacted by your GP, you should discuss your concerns with your GP or hospital clinician.
If you have an underlying health condition listed above, you are at very high risk of severe illness as a result of coronavirus (COVID-19) requiring admission to hospital.
Shielding is a practice used to protect extremely vulnerable people from coming into contact with coronavirus.
Visits from people who provide essential support to you such as healthcare, personal support with your daily needs or social care should continue, but carers and care workers must stay away if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). You may find this guidance on home care provision useful. All people coming to your home should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds on arrival to your house and often while they are there.
If you think you have developed symptoms of COVID-19 such as a new, continuous cough or fever, seek clinical advice using the NHS 111 online coronavirus service or call NHS 111. Do this as soon as you get symptoms.
If you have someone else living with you, they are not required to adopt these protective shielding measures for themselves. They should do what they can to support you in shielding and they should stringently follow guidance on social distancing, reducing their contact outside the home. If you care for but don’t actually live with someone who is extremely vulnerable, you should still stringently follow guidance on social distancing.
How do these measures differ from the social distancing guidance for vulnerable people issued?
People who are not clinically extremely vulnerable who have contracted coronavirus (COVID-19) and recovered will be able to go about their normal business.
Symptoms
The most common symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are recent onset of:
Shielding is a measure to protect extremely vulnerable people by minimising interaction between those who are extremely vulnerable and others. This means that those who are extremely vulnerable should not leave their homes, and within their homes should minimise all non-essential contact with other members of their household. This is to protect those who are at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) from coming into contact with the virus.
If you think you have a condition which makes you extremely vulnerable or have received a letter from NHS England you are strongly advised to shield yourself, to reduce the chance of getting coronavirus (COVID-19) and follow the face-to-face distancing measures below.
Strictly avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough.
While the rest of your household are not required to adopt these protective shielding measures for themselves, we would expect them to do what they can to support you in shielding and to stringently follow guidance on social distancing.
If the rest of your household stringently follow advice on social distancing and minimise the risk of spreading the virus within the home by following the advice above, there is no need for them to also shield alongside you.
There are general principles you should follow to help prevent the spread of airway and chest infections caused by respiratory viruses, including:
avoid close contact with people who have symptoms
clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home
What should you do if you develop symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)?
If you develop symptoms of COVID-19 (high temperature above 37.8 °C and/or new and continuous cough), seek clinical advice using the NHS 111 online coronavirus service or call NHS111 if you don’t have internet access. In an emergency, call 999 if you are seriously ill. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital. Do this as soon as you get symptoms.
To help the NHS provide you with the best care if you need to go to hospital as a result of catching coronavirus, we ask that you prepare a single hospital bag. This should include your emergency contact, a list of the medications you take (including dose and frequency), any information on your planned care appointments and things you would need for an overnight stay (snacks, pyjamas, toothbrush, medication and so on). If you have an advanced care plan, please include that.
Ask family, friends and neighbours to support you and use online services. If this is not possible, then the public sector, business, charities and the general public are gearing up to help those advised to stay at home. Please discuss your daily needs during this period of staying at home with carers, family, friends, neighbours or local community groups to see how they can support you. Please visit gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable to register for the support that you need. This includes help with food, shopping deliveries and additional care you might need.
You may also need to arrange for collection or delivery of hospital specialist medication that is prescribed to you by your hospital care team.
If you receive support from health and social care organisations, for example, if you have care provided for you through the local authority or health care system, this will continue as normal. Your health or social care provider will be asked to take additional precautions to make sure that you are protected. The advice for formal carers is included in the home care provision.
What should you do if you have hospital and GP appointments during this period?
We advise everyone to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, if you have a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, talk to your GP or specialist to ensure you continue to receive the care you need and determine which of these appointments are absolutely essential.
It is possible that your hospital may need to cancel or postpone some clinics and appointments. You should contact your hospital or clinic to confirm appointments.
If you receive regular health or social care from an organisation, either through your local authority or paid for by yourself, inform your care providers that you are shielding and agree a plan for continuing your care.
Speak to your carers about backup plans for your care in case your main carer is unwell and needs to self-isolate. If you need help with care but you’re not sure who to contact, or if you do not have family or friends who can help you, you can contact your local council who will be able to help you and assess any social care needs you might have. Please visit gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable to register for the support that you need.
If you are caring for someone who is extremely vulnerable due to severe illness from COVID-19, there are some simple steps that you can take to protect them and to reduce their risk at the current time. Ensure you follow advice on good hygiene:
provide information on who they should call if they feel unwell, how to use NHS 111 online coronavirus service and leave the number for NHS 111 prominently displayed
look after your own wellbeing and physical health during this time. Further information on this is available.
Social isolation, reduction in physical activity, unpredictability and changes in routine can all contribute to increasing stress. Many people including those without existing mental health needs may feel anxious about this impact including support with daily living, ongoing care arrangements with health providers, support with medication and changes in their daily routines.
If you are receiving services for your mental health, learning disability or autism and are worried about the impact of isolation please contact your key worker or care coordinator or provider to review your care plan. If you have additional needs please contact your key worker or care coordinator to develop a safety or crisis plan.
At times like these, it can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse. There are simple things you can do that may help, to stay mentally and physically active during this time such as:
try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, drink enough water, exercise regularly, and try to avoid smoking, alcohol and drugs
Constantly watching the news can make you feel more worried. If you think it is affecting you, try to limit the time you spend watching, reading, or listening to media coverage of the outbreak. It may help to only check the news at set times or limit this to a couple of times a day.
Try to focus on the things you can control, such as your behaviour, who you speak to and who you get information from. Every Mind Matters provides simple tips and advice to start taking better care of your mental health.
If you are struggling with your mental health, please see the NHS mental health and wellbeing advice website for self-assessment, audio guides and tools that you can use. If you are still struggling after several weeks and it is affecting your daily life, please contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111.

COVID-19 is mainly passed on by person-to-person spread between people who are in close contact with one another and by droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
It can also spread through contact with a surface or object that has the virus on it. Cleaning helps minimise the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Fortunately, normal cleaning methods do kill this virus. Cleaners, caretakers and concierges play an important role in keeping people in their buildings protected, and are on the frontline in the battle against coronavirus (COVID-19) to keep staff, customers, and particularly the most vulnerable safe.

COVID-19: guidance for employees
You should work from home unless it is impossible for you to do so.
Sometimes this will not be possible, as not everyone can work from home. Certain jobs require people to travel to their place of work – for instance if you operate machinery, work in construction or manufacturing, or are delivering front line services.
If you have symptoms of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home and do not leave your house for 7 days from when your symptoms started.
If you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill.
If you are staying at home because of COVID-19 you can now claim SSP. This includes individuals who are caring for people in the same household and therefore have been advised to do a household quarantine.
We are legislating for SSP to be paid from day 1, rather than day 4, of your absence from work if you are absent from work due to sickness or need to stay at home due to COVID-19. Once the legislation has been passed, this will apply retrospectively from 13 March. You should talk to your employer if you are eligible for SSP and need to claim.
If you have COVID-19 or are advised to stay at home, you can get an ‘isolation note’ by visiting NHS 111 online, rather than visiting a doctor. For COVID-19 cases this replaces the usual need to provide a ‘fit note’ (sometimes called a ‘sick note’) after 7 days of sickness absence.
If you are not eligible for SSP – for example if you are self-employed or earning below the Lower Earnings Limit of £118 per week – and you have COVID-19 or are advised to stay at home, you can now more easily make a claim for Universal Credit or new style Employment and Support Allowance.
If you are eligible for new style Employment and Support Allowance, it will now be payable from day 1 of sickness, rather than day 8, if you have COVID-19 or are advised to stay at home.
If you and your employer both agree, your employer might be able to keep you on the payroll if they’re unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of coronavirus (COVID-19). This is known as being ‘on furlough’.
Check if you could be covered by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.
Whether you are currently in or out of work, if you are on a low income and affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19, you will be able to access the full range of the welfare system, including Universal Credit.
If you have COVID-19 or are staying at home
To support you with the economic impact of the outbreak, and allow you to follow government guidance on self-isolation and social distancing, from 6 April the requirements of the Minimum Income Floor will be temporarily relaxed. This change will apply to all Universal Credit claimants and will last for the duration of the outbreak.

if evidence is required by an employer, those with symptoms of coronavirus can get an isolation note from NHS 111 online, and those who live with someone that has symptoms can get a note from the NHS website
This guidance will assist employers, businesses and their staff in addressing coronavirus (COVID-19).
ensure employees who are in a vulnerable group are strongly advised to follow social distancing guidance
make sure everyone’s contact numbers and emergency contact details are up to date
make sure managers know how to spot symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) and are clear on any relevant processes, for example sickness reporting and sick pay, and procedures in case someone in the workplace is potentially infected and needs to take the appropriate action
Symptoms
The most common symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are a new, continuous cough or a high temperature.
For most people, coronavirus (COVID-19) will be a mild infection.
However, you should encourage your employees to work from home unless it is impossible for them to do so.
Sometimes this will not be possible, as not everyone can work from home. Certain jobs require people to travel to their place of work – for instance if they operate machinery, work in construction or manufacturing, or are delivering front line services.
What to do if someone develops symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) on site
If they need clinical advice, they should go online to NHS 111 or call 111 if they don’t have internet access. In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital.
If a member of staff has helped someone who was taken unwell with a new, continuous cough or a high temperature, they do not need to go home unless they develop symptoms themselves. They should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection.
Anyone who has a new, continuous cough or a high temperature should be advised to quickly and directly return home and to remain there and initiate household isolation. If they have to use public transport, they should try to keep away from other people and catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue.
Employers should use their discretion and respect the medical need to self-isolate in making decisions about sick pay.
By law, medical evidence is not required for the first 7 days of sickness. After 7 days, employers may use their discretion around the need for medical evidence if an employee is staying at home.
We strongly suggest that employers use their discretion around the need for medical evidence for a period of absence where an employee is advised to stay at home either as they are unwell themselves, or live with someone who is, in accordance with the public health advice issued by the government.
If evidence is required to cover self-isolation or household isolation beyond the first 7 days of absence then employees can get an isolation note from NHS 111 online or from the NHS website.
Employees are entitled to time off work to help someone who depends on them (a ‘dependant’) in an unexpected event or emergency. This would apply to situations related to coronavirus (COVID-19). For example:
to help their child or another dependant if they’re sick, or need to go into isolation or hospital
ACAS has more information on coronavirus and can help with specific queries by phone.
Limiting spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in business and workplaces
Businesses and employers can help reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) by reminding everyone of the public health advice. Posters, leaflets and other materials are available.
Frequently clean and disinfect objects and surfaces that are touched regularly, using your standard cleaning products.

The Self-employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) will support self-employed individuals (including members of partnerships) who have lost income due to coronavirus (COVID-19).
We will bring forward legislation to allow small-and medium-sized businesses and employers to reclaim Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) paid for sickness absence due to COVID-19. The eligibility criteria for the scheme will be as follows:
this refund will cover up to 2 weeks’ SSP per eligible employee who has been off work because of COVID-19
employers will be able to reclaim expenditure for any employee who has claimed SSP (according to the new eligibility criteria) as a result of COVID-19
employers should maintain records of staff absences and payments of SSP, but employees will not need to provide a GP fit note. If evidence is required by an employer, those with symptoms of coronavirus can get an isolation note from NHS 111 online and those who live with someone that has symptoms can get a note from the NHS website
Support for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses that pay business rates
Business rates holiday for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses
We will introduce a business rates holiday for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England for the 2020 to 2021 tax year.
your business is in the retail, hospitality and/or leisure sector
for hospitality, as hotels, guest & boarding premises or self-catering accommodation
Cash grants for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses
The Retail and Hospitality Grant Scheme provides businesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors with a cash grant of up to £25,000 per property.
your business is in the retail, hospitality or leisure sector
Support for businesses through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme
The temporary Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme supports SMEs with access to loans, overdrafts, invoice finance and asset finance of up to £5 million and for up to 6 years.
To apply, you should talk to your bank or one of the 40 accredited finance providers (not the British Business Bank) as soon as possible, to discuss your business plan. You can find out the latest on the best ways to contact them via their websites. Please note that branches may currently be shut down to enable social distancing.
Support for larger firms through the COVID-19 Corporate Financing Facility
Under the new Covid-19 Corporate Financing Facility, the Bank of England will buy short term debt from larger companies.
If you have missed a tax payment or you might miss your next payment due to COVID-19, please call HMRC’s dedicated helpline: 0800 0159 559.
Most commercial insurance policies are unlikely to cover pandemics or unspecified notifiable diseases, such as COVID-19.
However, those businesses which have an insurance policy that covers government ordered closure and pandemics or government ordered closure and unspecified notifiable disease should be able to make a claim (subject to the terms and conditions of their policy).
Notifiable diseases
Notifiable diseases are certain infectious diseases that registered medical practitioners have a statutory duty to notify the ‘proper officer’ at their local council or local health protection team about when they come across a suspected case.
The government keeps an updated list of notifable diseases. On 5 March 2020, the government added COVID-19 to its list of notifiable diseases.
Many insurers use diseases on this list as triggers for the activation or exclusion of insurance cover. For example, insurers’ policies that cover notifiable diseases will typically only cover a specific subset of notifiable diseases (such as Cholera or Anthrax) that the insurer will reference in the policy documentation. These policies will exclude any notifiable disease not on the insurers list, as well as future/unknown diseases (such as COVID-19). The price that the insurer charges for the policy is modelled against the risk posed by this set list of diseases.
Unspecified notifiable diseases
Some businesses will have purchased add-ons for their insurance that cover for ‘unspecified notifiable diseases’. These policies effectively cover any disease listed as a notifiable disease, enabling the business to claim for losses for all notifiable diseases as well as from diseases that are unknown at the point the policy is written.
The effect of the government adding COVID-19 to its list of notifiable diseases is to ensure that businesses with unspecified notifiable disease cover are able to make a claim – subject to the terms and conditions in their policy. For example, someone infected with COVID-19 may need to have been on the premises.
Insurers have agreed that this advice is sufficient for businesses covered for COVID-19 losses to make a claim (if the only barrier to them making a claim was a lack of clarity on whether the government had ordered businesses to close). As such, intervention by the police or any other statutory body is no longer required to trigger cover in the current circumstances.
However, most businesses’ commercial insurance policies (including for denial of access) are unlikely to offer cover for COVID-19. Insurance policies differ significantly, so businesses are encouraged to check the terms and conditions of their specific policy and contact their providers.
Businesses with event cancellation policies that include unspecified notifiable disease extensions should be able to make a claim for the necessary and unavoidable cancellation, abandonment, curtailment, postponement and disruption of their event for reasons beyond the control of organisers and participants (subject to the other terms and exclusions of their policy).
Commercial tenants who cannot pay their rent because of COVID-19 will be protected from eviction.
The change will come into force when the Coronavirus Bill receives Royal Assent. No action is required.
BIDs will be able to extend the maximum duration of their BID arrangements until 31 March 2021 by delaying BID ballots due to take place this year. This enables BIDs, and the local authorities who administer the ballot process, to concentrate on responding to the current emergency.
The change will come into force when the Coronavirus Bill receives Royal Assent. No action is required.

2. Can I go to the dentist, my GP or another medical appointment?
You can leave home for medical appointments.
GP practices may postpone non-urgent health checks or routine appointments.
You should go to the doctor if there is an essential medical need.
People must stay at home as much as possible to reduce the spread of the virus. But you can also still go outside once a day for a walk, run, cycle. When doing this you must minimise the time you are out of your home and stay at least two metres away from anyone else that isn’t from your household.
You may travel for work purposes, but only where you cannot work from home.
5. I’m not a critical worker and I can’t work from home. What should I do?
If you cannot work from home then you can still travel to work. This is consistent with the Chief Medical Officer’s advice.
Critical workers are those who can still take their children to school or childcare. This critical worker definition does not affect whether or not you can travel to work – if you are not a critical worker, you may still travel to work provided you cannot work from home.
Anyone who has symptoms or is in a household where someone has symptoms should not go to work and should self-isolate.
The government is not saying only people doing “essential” work can go to work. Anyone who cannot work from home can still go to work.
Every worker – whether critical or not – should work from home if they can but may otherwise travel to work.
We must all stay away from each other to stop spreading the virus, and that means you should not be meeting friends unless you live in the same household.
you are well and have no symptoms like a cough or high temperature and nobody in your household does
you do not have any long-term health conditions that make you vulnerable to coronavirus
10. My boss is forcing me to go to work but I’m scared of coronavirus. What should I do?
Employers must make all efforts to help people to work from home where possible, as this will help limit the spread of the virus by reducing the amount of contact between people.
For these workers who need to be at work, do not have symptoms or live with anyone who has symptoms, and are not vulnerable people, we have outlined clear guidance for employers to help protect workers.
Homebuyers and renters should, where possible, delay moving to a new house while measures are in place to fight coronavirus.
If moving is unavoidable for contractual reasons and the parties are unable to reach an agreement to delay, people must follow advice on staying away from others to minimise the spread of the virus.

Following on from the government’s guidance on social distancing in relation to COVID-19, people should avoid travelling unless it is essential.
This guidance is for people planning to visit second homes or holiday premises during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Essential travel does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People must remain in their primary residence. Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.

Guidance for health professionals
The most common symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are recent onset of a new continuous cough and/or high temperature. If you have these symptoms, however mild, stay at home and do not leave your house for 7 days from when your symptoms started (if you live alone), or 14 days (if you live with someone who has symptoms). You do not need to call NHS 111 to go into self-isolation. If your symptoms worsen during home isolation or are no better after 7 days, contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999.
Clean and disinfect regularly touched objects and surfaces using your regular cleaning products to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people.
At the current time and based on our understanding of what is known of COVID-19 and other similar respiratory viruses, it is likely that older people and those with chronic medical conditions may be vulnerable to severe disease. As more information emerges, recommendations may change.

Number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases and risk in the UK
The latest number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases and risk level in the UK.
Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England
Stay at home to stop coronavirus spreading.
As of 5pm on 28 March 2020, 1,228 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.
The figures for test results and for deaths are compiled from different sources. This is why the figures for deaths are reported from an earlier point in time than the figures for test results.
Confirmed cases in each local authority and NHS region are published by Public Health England (PHE).
The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

COVID-19 advice for accommodation providers
Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and Department of Health and Social Care
Full consideration should be given to the possible exclusions for residents that should be allowed to remain. Any decision to close should be implemented in full compliance with the social distancing guidelines.
There is a specific need for some or all of the site to remain open (for example they are housing people who have been flooded out of their homes, being used by public services to provide emergency accommodation or are not able to return to their primary residence).
People staying in accommodation that have symptoms of Covid-19
If anyone is displaying signs of the Covid-19 virus (cough, fever), they should not be using public transport. If they are not symptomatic but they need to return to where they live, then using public transport is ok. When using public transport people should try to adhere to the simple social distancing principles of being two metres apart.
Hotels and accommodation providers that are remaining open to house key workers, vulnerable groups and other exempted groups will still be able to serve food, subject to the social distancing guidelines (for example by providing a takeaway service, ‘grab and go’ service or room service).
Workplace canteens can also stay open where required but must adhere to social distancing guidelines.

HMCTS response to coronavirus outbreak
During this unprecedented public health emergency, we’re working hard to keep our justice system functioning. We’re focusing on priority cases, changing working practices and introducing new procedures to minimise risks to the judiciary, staff and all those who use our courts and tribunals.
Please see our daily operational summary on courts and tribnuals during the coronavirus outbreak to get the latest information about what is happening across HMCTS. Any changes to individual hearings will be communicated directly to those affected, usually by email and/or phone.
We have published detailed information on our priorities during the coronavirus outbreak.
Priority courts during coronavirus outbreak
A network of priority courts will remain open during the coronavirus pandemic to make sure the justice system continues to operate effectively. The work of courts and tribunals will be consolidated into fewer buildings, maintaining the safety of all in the courts and in line with public health advice.
Telephone and video hearings during coronavirus outbreak
Read our new guidance on how HMCTS will use telephone and video technology during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

Additional cleanliness and hygiene measures for coronavirus
If we have a confirmed case of coronavirus we will - follow Government guidelines and carry out a deep clean of the setting or areas with which the individual would have had contact.
New contractors, Engie, take over the cleaning of the courts from 1 April 2020; the new contract is more stringent than the old and we are making sure Engie understand our expectations especially during this outbreak.
To maintain social distancing in our courts and tribunal buildings, we’ll ask our users to make sure there is at least 2 metres’ separation between everyone at all times.
Following the Lord Chief Justice announcement on 23 March 2020 on jury trials and in light of the latest coronavirus (COVID-19) advice, we need to make sure that everyone in courts can be kept safe, particularly regarding social distancing. This means that all new trials will be postponed for a short time both to allow us to make arrangements and to give us more space to manage existing trials.

Passengers who return from a cruise ship or river cruise voyage are advised to stay home for 14 days, monitor their health, and practice social distancing.
CDC has issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice for cruise ship travel.
Stay home for 14 days from the time you return home from a cruise ship or river cruise and practice social distancing:

These employees of critical infrastructure, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security (https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce
CDC does not generally issue advisories or restrictions for travel within the United States. However, cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in many states, and some areas are experiencing community spread of the disease. Crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase chances of getting COVID-19, if there are other travelers with coronavirus infection. There are several things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel.
Is COVID-19 spreading in the area where you’re going?
If COVID-19 is spreading at your destination, but not where you live, you may be more likely to get infected if you travel there than if you stay home. If you have questions about your destination, you should check your destination’s local health department website for more information.
Your risk of exposure to respiratory viruses like coronavirus may increase in crowded settings, particularly closed-in settings with little air circulation. This may include settings such as conferences, public events (like concerts and sporting events), religious gatherings, public spaces (like movie theatres and shopping malls), and public transportation (like buses, metro, trains).
Are you or your travel companion(s) more likely to get severe illness if you get COVID-19?
People at higher risk for severe disease are older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions (such as heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes). CDC recommends that travelers at higher risk for COVID-19 complications avoid all cruise travel and nonessential air travel.
Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, in case you are told to stay home for 14 days for self-monitoring or if you get sick with COVID-19?
If you have close contact with someone with COVID-19 during travel, you may be asked to stay home to self-monitor and avoid contact with others for up to 14 days after travel. If you become sick with COVID-19, you may be unable to go to work or school until you’re considered noninfectious. You will be asked to avoid contact with others (including being in public places) during this period of infectiousness.
Do you live with someone who is older or has a serious, chronic medical condition?
If you get sick with COVID-19 upon your return from travel, your household contacts may be at risk of infection. Household contacts who are older adults or persons of any age with severe chronic medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Is COVID-19 spreading where I live when I return from travel?
Consider the risk of passing COVID-19 to others during travel, particularly if you will be in close contact with people who are older adults or have severe chronic health condition These people are at higher risk of getting very sick. If your symptoms are mild or you don’t have a fever, you may not realize you are infectious.
Depending on your unique circumstances, you may choose to delay or cancel your plans. If you do decide to travel, be sure to take steps to help prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases during travel.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based upon available information to date, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include:
People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] >40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver disease might also be at risk
People who are pregnant should be monitored since they are known to be at risk with severe viral illness, however, to date data on COVID-19 has not shown increased risk
Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications

Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among People Experiencing Unsheltered Homelessness
This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this interim guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available.
People at Higher Risk of COVID-19
Isolation housing
This guidance is intended to provide key actions that local and state health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, emergency planners, healthcare facilities, and homeless outreach services can take to protect people experiencing homelessness from the spread of COVID-19.
People experiencing unsheltered homelessness (those sleeping outside or in places not meant for human habitation) may be at risk for infection when there is community spread of COVID-19. This interim guidance is intended to support response planning by local and state health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, emergency planners, healthcare facilities, and homeless outreach services. Homeless shelters and other facilities should also refer to the Interim Guidance for Homeless Shelters. Community and faith-based organizations can refer to the Interim Guidance for Community and Faith-based Organizations for other information related to their staff and organizations.
COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus. There is much to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features of the disease. Everyone can do their part to help plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat.
Lack of housing contributes to poor health outcomes, and linkage to permanent housing should continue to be a priority. In the context of COVID-19, the risks associated with sleeping outdoors in an encampment setting are different than with staying indoors in a congregate setting such as an emergency shelter or other congregate living facility. Outdoor settings may allow people to increase distance between themselves and others. However, sleeping outdoors often does not provide protection from the environment, quick access to hygiene and sanitation facilities, or connection to healthcare. The balance of risks should be considered for each individual experiencing unsheltered homelessness.
Reaching and protecting people experiencing unsheltered homelessness during the COVID-19 outbreak will require coordination across several local sectors. To prevent negative outcomes from lack of services, community leaders should continue activities that protect people experiencing homelessness, including supporting continuity of homeless services, healthcare, behavioral health services, food pantries, and linkages to permanent housing. Plans need to be clearly communicated to all stakeholders.
Homeless outreach teams and public health outreach workers will often be the front lines. These workers need to be prepared to protect themselves and their clients, provide health education information, and help direct their clients to care as necessary (see box).
State and local health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, and emergency planners will need to identify where people without housing can be isolated and receive care if they are suspected to have COVID-19, are awaiting COVID-19 testing results, or are confirmed to be positive COVID-19 cases. These plans should also include transportation protocols.
Hospitals and healthcare facilities should ensure that they are involved in planning the logistics for safely discharging COVID-19 patients to a designated location if they do not require hospitalization but lack housing.
Law enforcement should be apprised of plans related to protecting people experiencing unsheltered homelessness from COVID-19 in order to best work in coordination with homelessness service systems and state and local health departments.
Unless individual housing units are available, do not clear encampments during community spread of COVID-19. Clearing encampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This increases the potential for infectious disease spread.
Provide straightforward communications to people sleeping outside in the appropriate language. Identify people who are influential in the community who can help communicate with others. Post signs in strategic locations to provide information on hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. Request up-to-date contact information for each person.

People at Higher Risk of COVID-19
Some people who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness may be at higher risk of moderate to severe disease because of certain conditions. Pay particular attention to preventing disease among these individuals.
Isolation housing
Local partners should plan for where individuals and families with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experiencing unsheltered homelessness can safely stay. These should include places where people who are confirmed to be positive and those awaiting test results can be isolated. Additionally, if a person needs to be hospitalized, a plan should be in place for how they will safely recover after discharge. Ideally, these individuals will be housed for the duration necessary, as outlined in the recommendations for discontinuation of isolation. Isolation housing could be units designated by local authorities or shelters determined to have capacity to sufficiently isolate these individuals. If medical care is not necessary and if no other options are available, advise the individual on how to isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support. In each scenario, identify how to safely transport patients to and from healthcare and housing facilities.
Behavioral health teams should be involved in the planning for these sites to facilitate continued access to support for people with substance abuse or mental health disorders. In some situations, for example due to severe untreated mental illness, an individual may not be able to comply with isolation recommendations. In these cases, community leaders should consult local health authorities to determine alternative options.
When COVID-19 is spreading in your community, assign outreach staff who are at higher risk for severe illness to other duties. Advise outreach staff who will be continuing outreach activities on how to protect themselves and their clients from COVID-19 in the course of their normal duties. Instruct staff to:
Greet clients from a distance of 6 feet and explain that you are taking additional precautions to protect yourself and the client from COVID-19.
Screen clients for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 by asking them if they have a fever, new or worsening cough, or shortness of breath.
If urgent medical attention is necessary, use standard outreach protocols to facilitate access to healthcare.
Maintain good hand hygiene by washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol) on a regular basis.
Wear gloves if you need to handle client belongings. Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer (>60% alcohol) before and after wearing gloves.
If at any point you do not feel that you are able to protect yourself or your client from the spread of COVID-19, discontinue the interaction and notify your supervisor. Examples include if the client declines to wear a mask or if you are unable to maintain a distance of 6 feet.
Street medicine and healthcare worker outreach staff should review and follow recommendations for healthcare workers.

If you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 because of your age or because you have a serious long-term health problem, it is extra important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of getting sick with the disease.
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed.
Contact your healthcare provider to ask about obtaining extra necessary medications to have on hand in case there is an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community and you need to stay home for a prolonged period of time.
Be sure you have over-the-counter medicines and medical supplies (tissues, etc.) to treat fever and other symptoms. Most people will be able to recover from COVID-19 at home.
If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect your home to remove germs: practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks & cell phones)
Avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated spaces. Your risk of exposure to respiratory viruses like COVID-19 may increase in crowded, closed-in settings with little air circulation if there are people in the crowd who are sick.
If COVID-19 is spreading in your community
Take extra measures to put distance between yourself and other people to further reduce your risk of being exposed to this new virus.
If a COVID-19 outbreak happens in your community, it could last for a long time. (An outbreak is when a large number of people suddenly get sick.) Depending on how severe the outbreak is, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce people’s risk of being exposed to COVID-19. These actions can slow the spread and reduce the impact of disease.
Consult with your health care provider for more information about monitoring your health for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.
Stay in touch with others by phone or email. You may need to ask for help from friends, family, neighbors, community health workers, etc. if you become sick.
Watch for symptoms and emergency warning signs
Pay attention for potential COVID-19 symptoms including, fever, cough, and shortness of breath. If you feel like you are developing symptoms, call your doctor.
If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. In adults, emergency warning signs*:
*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.
Call your healthcare provider and let them know about your symptoms. Tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help them take care of you and keep other people from getting infected or exposed.
If you are not sick enough to be hospitalized, you can recover at home. Follow CDC instructions for how to take care of yourself at home.
Know when to get emergency help.
Get medical attention immediately if you have any of the emergency warning signs listed above.
Community preparedness planning for COVID-19 should include older adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into consideration.
Many of these individuals live in the community, and many depend on services and supports provided in their homes or in the community to maintain their health and independence.
Long-term care facilities should be vigilant to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19. Information for long-term care facilities can be found here.
Monitor food and other medical supplies (oxygen, incontinence, dialysis, wound care) needed and create a back-up plan.
If you care for a loved one living in a care facility, monitor the situation, ask about the health of the other residents frequently and know the protocol if there is an outbreak.

What to Know About Asthma and COVID-19
This information is based on what we currently know about the spread and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Risk of Getting COVID-19
People with asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.  COVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease.
There is currently no specific treatment for or vaccine to prevent COVID-19.  The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
Prepare for COVID-19
Clean your hands often by washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed.
If someone in your home is sick, have them stay away from the rest of the household to reduce the risk of spreading the virus in your home.
Take your asthma medication exactly as prescribed. Talk to your healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about creating an emergency supply of prescription medications, such as asthma inhalers. Make sure that you have 30 days of non-prescription medications and supplies on hand too in case you need to stay home for a long time.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces like tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks daily to protect yourself against COVID-19. Avoid disinfectants that can cause an asthma attack.
As more cases of COVID-19 are discovered and our communities take action to combat the spread of disease, it is natural for some people to feel concerned or stressed. Strong emotions can trigger an asthma attack. Take steps to help yourself cope with stress and anxiety.
If you have symptoms
Contact your health care provider to ask about your symptoms.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Information about Coronavirus Disease 2019
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.
What is the risk to pregnant women of getting COVID-19? Is it easier for pregnant women to become ill with the disease? If they become infected, will they be more sick than other people?
We do not currently know if pregnant women have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result. Pregnant women experience changes in their bodies that may increase their risk of some infections. With viruses from the same family as COVID-19, and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, women have had a higher risk of developing severe illness. It is always important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses.
How can pregnant women protect themselves from getting COVID-19?
Pregnant women should do the same things as the general public to avoid infection. You can help stop the spread of COVID-19 by taking these actions:
Clean your hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 disease at CDC’s (Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus).
Can COVID-19 cause problems for a pregnancy?
We do not know at this time if COVID-19 would cause problems during pregnancy or affect the health of the baby after birth.
Can COVID-19 be passed from a pregnant woman to the fetus or newborn?
We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus that causes COVID-19 to her fetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. No infants born to mothers with COVID-19 have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. In these cases, which are a small number, the virus was not found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk.
If a pregnant woman has COVID-19 during pregnancy, will it hurt the baby?
We do not know at this time what if any risk is posed to infants of a pregnant woman who has COVID-19. There have been a small number of reported problems with pregnancy or delivery (e.g. preterm birth) in babies born to mothers who tested positive for COVID-19 during their pregnancy. However, it is not clear that these outcomes were related to maternal infection.
Interim Guidance on Breastfeeding for a Mother Confirmed or Under Investigation For COVID-19
This interim guidance is intended for women who are confirmed to have COVID-19 or are persons-under-investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 and are currently breastfeeding. This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about COVID-19 and the transmission of other viral respiratory infections. CDC will update this interim guidance as needed as additional information becomes available. For breastfeeding guidance in the immediate postpartum setting, refer to Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of 2019 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings.
Transmission of COVID-19 through breast milk
Much is unknown about how COVID-19 is spread. Person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza (flu) and other respiratory pathogens spread. In limited studies on women with COVID-19 and another coronavirus infection, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), the virus has not been detected in breast milk; however we do not know whether mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus via breast milk.
Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses. There are rare exceptions when breastfeeding or  feeding expressed breast milk is not recommended. CDC has no specific guidance for breastfeeding during infection with similar viruses like SARS-CoV or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).
Outside of the immediate postpartum setting, CDC recommends that a mother with flu continue breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk to her infant while taking precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant.
Guidance on breastfeeding for mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or under investigation for COVID-19
Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for most infants. However, much is unknown about COVID-19. Whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding should be determined by the mother in coordination with her family and healthcare providers.  A mother with confirmed COVID-19 or who is a symptomatic PUI should take all possible precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant, including washing her hands before touching the infant and wearing a face mask, if possible, while feeding at the breast.  If expressing breast milk with a manual or electric breast pump, the mother should wash her hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning after each use. If possible, consider having someone who is well feed the expressed breast milk to the infant.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. More information on Are you at higher risk for serious illness?
There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.
Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.
Clean and disinfect
Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect:
Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. Use disinfectants appropriate for the surface.
Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.
Alcohol solutions.
Ensure solution has at least 70% alcohol.
Other common EPA-registered household disinfectants.
 claims are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).

How to clean and disinfect
Wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect.
Disinfect
Clean the area or item with soap and water or another detergent if it is dirty. Then, use disinfectant.
Recommend use of EPA-registered household disinfectant
Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used if appropriate for the surface. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.
Disinfect with an EPA-registered household disinfectant. These disinfectants
meet EPA’s criteria for use against COVID-19.
If no guidance, use alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol. Dry surface thoroughly.
Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces.
Cleaning and disinfecting your building or facility if someone is sick
Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours (or as long as possible) before you clean or disinfect.
Clean and disinfect all areas used by the sick person, such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines.
Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash.
Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.
Educate workers performing cleaning, laundry, and trash pick-up to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19.
Provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms within 14 days after their last possible exposure to the virus.
Follow CDC’s guidance for colleges and universities. Work with state and local health officials to determine the best way to isolate people who are sick and if temporary housing is needed.
For guidance on cleaning and disinfecting a sick person’s bedroom/bathroom, review CDC’s guidance on disinfecting your home if someone is sick.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
COVID-19 和动物
孕妇和 COVID-19
A：新型冠状病毒 (CoV) 是一种之前尚未确定新的冠状病毒。导致冠状病毒疾病 2019 (COVID-19) 的病毒不同于在人类中普遍传播的冠状病毒 ，引起轻度疾病，如普通感冒。
冠状病毒 229E、NL63、OC43 或 HKU1 的诊断与 COVID-19 诊断不同。这些是不同的病毒，2019-nCoV 患者将接受不同于常见冠状病毒诊断的患者的评估和护理。
Q：为什么现在引起疫情的该疾病被称为冠状病毒疾病 2019，COVID-19？
A：2020 年 2 月 11 日，世界卫生组织宣布了导致最早在中国武汉发现的 2019 新型冠状病毒疫情疾病的官方正式名称。该疾病的新名称是 2019 年冠状病毒疾病，缩写为 COVID-19。在 COVID-19 中，“CO”代表“冠状”、“VI”代表“病毒”，以及“D”代表“疾病”。之前，该疾病被称为“2019 年新冠状病毒”或“2019-nCoV”。
人类冠状病毒有许多类型 ，包括一些通常引起轻度上呼吸道疾病的病毒。COVID-19 是一种新的疾病，是由人类之前未见过的新型（或新的）冠状病毒引起的。这种疾病的名称是根据世界卫生组织 (WHO) 最佳实践外部图标
2020 年 2 月 11 日，负责命名新病毒的国际病毒分类委员会，将其命名为新型冠状病毒，首先在中国武汉发现，重度急性呼吸道综合征冠状病毒 2，简称为 SARS-CoV-2。
正如名称，病毒与在 2002-2003 年间引起严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）疫情的 SARS 相关冠状病毒（SARS-CoV）相关，但它并不是相同的病毒。
A：公共卫生官员及合作伙伴正在努力确定导致 COVID-19 的病毒的原始动物来源。冠状病毒是一大类病毒，其中一些会导致人类患病，而另一些会在动物（包括骆驼、猫和蝙蝠）之间传播。对该病毒的遗传树进行分析表明，它起源于蝙蝠，但是目前尚不清楚病毒是否是直接从蝙蝠中跳出，还是存在中间动物宿主。SARS-CoV，另一种感染人的冠状病毒，来自麝猫，而 MERS-CoV 是一种感染人的冠状病毒，来自骆驼。有关这种新型冠状病毒的来源和传播的更多信息，在 COVID-19 情况总结中提供：病毒的来源和传播。
A：新的冠状病毒看起来似乎是人到人之间传播。了解关于 COVID-19 扩散的已知信息。
Q：已患有 COVID-19 的人是否可以将疾病传播给他人？
A：引起 COVID-19 的病毒是从人到人的传播。正在患有 COVID-19 疾病的人可将疾病传播给他人。这就是为什么 CDC(美国疾病控制与预防中心) 建议这些患者或在医院，或家中进行隔离（取决于患病程度），直到它们好转，并不伴有感染他人的风险。
Q：已被隔离的 COVID-19 的人能否将疾病传播给他人？
A：隔离是指曾经暴露于传染性疾病的，但尚未发展成疾病（症状）的一个人或一组人，与未接触过的其他人分开，以防止该疾病传播的可能。隔离通常在传染病的潜伏期建立，这是人在暴露后患病的时间范围。对于 COVID-19，隔离期为从最后一次暴露之日起的 14 天，因为 14 天是类似冠状病毒的最长的潜伏期。从 COVID-19 隔离中解除的人不再被视为有将病毒传播给他人的风险，因为在隔离期间未发生疾病。
  Q：SARS-CoV-2（引起 COVID-19 的病毒）与 MERS-CoV 或 SARS 病毒相同吗？
A：不同。冠状病毒是一大类病毒，其中一些会导致人类患病，而另一些会在动物（包括骆驼、猫和蝙蝠）之间传播。最近出现的 SARS-CoV-2 与导致中东呼吸系统综合征 (MERS) 的冠状病毒或导致严重急性呼吸综合征 (SARS) 冠状病毒的不同。遗传分析表明，SARS-CoV-2 与 2002-2003 年间人群中呼吸系统疾病疫情相关的 SARS-CoV 相关……
A：访问 COVID-19 预防和治疗页面，以了解如何保护自己免受呼吸系统疾病，如 COVID-19。
Q：如果我与患有 COVID-19 的人密切接触过，该怎么办？
A：在线提供一些与已确诊患有 COVID-19，或者正在接受其评估的患者有密切接触的人的信息。
Q：CDC 是否建议在社区中使用口罩来预防 COVID-19？
A：目前，CDC 并不建议健康人士戴口罩来保护自己免于患上呼吸道疾病（包括 COVID-19）。只有医疗保健专业人员建议时，您才应佩戴口罩。出现症状的 COVID-19 患者应该使用口罩。这是为了保护他人免受感染的风险。对于在封闭环境中（在家中或在医疗护理机构中），照顾感染 COVID-19 病患的医务工作者和其他人来说，戴口罩也是非常重要的。
Q：COVID-19 可引起哪些症状和并发症？
A：COVID-19 患者报告的当前症状包括轻度至重度呼吸系统疾病，伴发热1、咳嗽和呼吸困难。参阅关于 COVID-19 症状。
Q：我应该接受 COVID-19 检测吗？
A：在从中国旅行后 14 天内，如果您有发热，1及呼吸系统疾病的症状（如咳嗽或气短），您应该致电医疗保健专业人员，并提及您近期的旅行或密切接触。如果你曾与表现出这些症状的人有过密切接触2，而此人最近刚从这个地区旅行回来，您应该致电医疗保健专业人士，并提及您的密切接触和他们近期的旅行。您的医疗保健专业人员将与您所在州的公共卫生部门和 CDC (美国疾病控制与预防中心)合作，以确定您是否需要接受 COVID-19 检测。
Q：如何测试一个人的 COVID-19？
A：此时，COVID-19 的诊断测试只能在 CDC (美国疾病控制与预防中心) 进行。
确定了被调查人员 （PUI）的州和地方卫生部门，应立即通知 CDC(美国疾病控制与预防中心) 紧急行动中心 (EOC) 报告 PUI，并确定是否指示在 CDC(美国疾病控制与预防中心) 进行 COVID-19 测试。EOC 将协助当地/州的卫生部门适当地收集、储存和运送标本至 CDC，包括在下班时间或周末/节假日。
Q：一个人可以被检测为 COVID-19 阴性，之后又被检测为呈阳性吗？
A：使用 CDC(美国疾病控制与预防中心) 开发的诊断测试，阴性结果意味着在患者样本中未发现导致 COVID-19 的病毒。在感染的早期阶段，有可能检测不到病毒。
对于 COVID-19，当一个人出现症状时所采集样品的阴性测试结果可能意味着 COVID-19 病毒并未引起当前的疾病。
A：为正在被调查的患者的建议和指导；感染控制，包括个人防护装备指南；家庭护理和隔离；以及病例调查，请参阅医疗保健专业人员信息。有关样本采集和运输的信息，请参阅实验室信息。有关 COVID-19 公共卫生专业人员的信息，请参阅公共卫生专业人员信息。
在线提供有关 COVID-19 的医疗保健专业人员的其他常见问题及解答。
Q：CDC 对 COVID-19 所采取的措施是什么？
A：疫情紧急而且发展迅速，CDC(美国疾病控制与预防中心)将随时更新信息。CDC(美国疾病控制与预防中心) 24 小时全天候保护人们的健康。CDC(美国疾病控制与预防中心) 24 小时全天候保护人们的健康。在线提供更多关于 CDC(美国疾病控制与预防中心)对 COVID-19 的响应信息。
Q：我在美国是否有患 COVID-19 的风险？
A：这是一个快速演变的情况，并且风险评估可能每天都在改变。最新情况更新可在 CDC(美国疾病控制与预防中心) 的 冠状病毒疾病 2019 (COVID-19) 网页上提供。
A：有。美国首例 COVID-19 报告于 2020 年 1 月 21 日。在 2020 年 1 月 30 日，报道了美国首次确诊的人与人之间传播这种病毒的情况。参阅 COVID-19 当前美国病例数。
Q：从中国运输过来的包裹或产品是否让我有感染 COVID-19的风险？
目前尚不清楚新出现的 COVID-19 及其传播方式。之前已经出现了另外两种导致人体严重疾病的冠状病毒（MERS-CoV 和 SARS-CoV）。导致 COVID-19 的病毒与 MERS-CoV 相比，与 SARS-CoV 更具遗传学相关性，但两者都是源于蝙蝠的 β 病毒。虽然我们不确定这种病毒的行为方式是否与 SARS-CoV 和 MERS-CoV 相同，但我们可以使用这两种早期冠状病毒的信息指导我们。通常，由于这些冠状病毒在表面上的存活率较差，因此在环境温度下几天或几周内运输的产品或包裹的传播风险很低。冠状病毒通常被认为最常被呼吸道飞沫传播。目前，尚无证据支持与进口货物相关的 COVID-19 传播，而且在美国尚未有与进口货物相关的 COVID-19 病例。信息将在可用时在 2019 新型冠状病毒网站提供。
Q：温暖的天气会阻止 COVID-19 疫情吗？
A：尚不清楚天气和温度是否会影响 COVID-19 的传播。其他的一些其他病毒（如普通感冒和流感），在寒冷的天气月份中播散更多，但这并不意味着在其他月份就不可能感染这些病毒。  目前尚不清楚 COVID-19 的传播是否会在天气变暖时减弱。 关于 COVID-19 的可传播性，严重性和其他功能，还有更多的知识要了解，而且也正在进行调查。
  COVID-19 和动物
CDC 没有任何证据表明，从中国进口的动物或动物产品存在在美国传播 COVID-19 的风险。这是一个快速演变的情况，信息将在可用时随时更新。美国疾病控制与预防中心 (CDC)、美国农业部 (USDA) 和美国鱼类及野生动物管理局 (FWS) 在监管向美国进口活体动物和动物产品方面发挥着独特但互补的作用。CDC 监管对人类健康构成威胁的动物和动物产品， USDA 监管
Q：在 COVID-19 疫情期间，我能否带狗去美国旅行或将狗运进美国？
Q：我应该担心宠物或其他动物和 COVID-19 吗？
生病时，不要接触宠物或其他动物。尽管尚无宠物或其他动物由于 COVID-19 而生病的报道，但有多种冠状病毒可能会导致动物患病，并在动物和人之间传播。在我们了解到更多信息前，请避免与动物接触；如果您必须在动物周围或照顾宠物的话，请戴上口罩。
长时间处于 COVID-19 患者周围约 6 英尺（2 米）的范围内；在照顾 COVID-19 患者、与其同住、探访或共用医疗候诊区或房间时，可能会发生密切接触
与 COVID-19 患者的传染性分泌物直接接触（例如被咳嗽溅到）
告知密切接触定义的数据有限。评估密切接触时应考虑的因素包括暴露的持续时间（例如，更长的暴露时间可能会增加暴露风险），以及 COVID-19 患者的临床症状（例如，咳嗽可能会增加重病患者的暴露风险）。应特别考虑那些在医疗环境中暴露的人员。

Timely communication between clinical and laboratory staff is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling specimens from patients with possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such specimens should be labeled accordingly, and the laboratory should be alerted to ensure proper specimen handling. General and specific biosafety guidelines for handling SARS-CoV-2 specimens are provided below. For additional information on handling SARS-CoV-2 specimens, refer to the Laboratory Biosafety Frequently Asked Questions.
All laboratories should perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks. Risk assessments and mitigation measures are dependent on:
Virus isolation in cell culture and initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of SARS-CoV-2 specimens are NOT recommended at this time, except in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory.
For diagnostic testing of specimens conducted outside of a BSL-2 laboratory, such as rapid respiratory testing performed at the point of care, use Standard Precautions to provide a barrier between the specimen and personnel during specimen manipulation. For additional information on specimen collection, handling, and testing refer to Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons Under Investigation (PUIs).
Procedures with a High Likelihood to Generate Droplets or Aerosols
For procedures with a high likelihood to generate aerosols or droplets, use either a certified Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) or additional precautions to provide a barrier between the specimen and personnel. Examples of these additional precautions include personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a surgical mask or face shield, or other physical barriers, like a splash shield; centrifuge safety cups; and sealed centrifuge rotors to reduce the risk of exposure to laboratory personnel.
Site- and activity-specific biosafety risk assessments should be performed to determine if additional biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols.
Decontaminate work surfaces and equipment with appropriate disinfectants. Use EPA-registered hospital disinfectants with label claims to be effective against SARS-CoV-2
Handle laboratory waste from testing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient specimens as all other biohazardous waste in the laboratory. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that this laboratory waste needs any additional packaging or disinfection procedures

Frequently Asked Questions on COVID-19 Testing at Laboratories
1. Where do public health laboratories get access to testing kits to detect the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)?
CDC provides the test kits for public health laboratories (PHLs) to perform real-time RT-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19) in respiratory specimens. CDC received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on February 4, 2020 for use of this rRT-PCR test to detect the virus in upper and lower respiratory specimens.  These test kits are available through the International Reagent Resource (IRR)
.  For over ten years, CDC has provided test kits and reagents to PHLs through the IRR.  This resource was established to support state and local public health laboratories, Department of Defense laboratories, and other qualified laboratories participating in public health surveillance and studies.  Clinical and commercial laboratories conducting COVID-19 testing access test reagents from commercial reagent manufacturers which have received EUA from the FDA. Genomic RNA material for validation purposes can be obtained from BEI Resources as indicated in question 7 below.
The International Reagent Resource (IRR) was established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide registered users with reagents, tools and information for studying and detection of Influenza and other pathogens, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The IRR acquires, authenticates, and produces reagents that scientists need to carry out basic research and develop improved diagnostic tests, vaccines, and detection methods.  By centralizing these functions within the IRR, access to and use of these materials in the scientific and public health community is monitored and quality control of the reagents is assured.  The International Reagent Resource
3. What reagents do public health laboratories need to perform testing to detect the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)?
Public health laboratories in the U.S. performing COVID-19 testing of respiratory specimens are provided the following reagents from the CDC’s International Reagent Resource (IRR):
QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL with EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (obtained from IRR)
Roche MagNA Pure Compact with Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I

Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Allowance for self- or healthcare worker-collected nasal swabs as an acceptable specimen type if NP swab is not possible
Allowance for self- or healthcare worker-collected nasal turbinate swabs as an acceptable specimen type if NP swab is not possible
Standard operating procedure for public health labs to create their own viral transport media
Health care providers should contact their local/state health department immediately to notify them of patients with fever and lower respiratory illness who they suspect may have COVID-19. Local and state public health staff will determine if the patient meets the criteria for testing  for COVID-19. The state and local health department will assist clinicians to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. Clinical specimens should be collected for routine testing of respiratory pathogens at either clinical or public health labs. Note that clinical laboratories should NOT attempt viral isolation from specimens collected from persons suspected to have COVID-19 unless this is performed in a BSL3 laboratory.  Testing for other pathogens by the provider should be done as part of the initial evaluation but should not delay testing for COVID-19.
All testing for COVID-19 should be conducted in consultation with a healthcare provider, and only for patients demonstrating symptomatic disease. The guidance below addresses options for self-collection of specimens once a clinical determination has been made to pursue COVID-19 testing.
For initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19, CDC recommends collecting and testing an upper respiratory specimen. Nasopharyngeal specimen is the preferred choice for swab-based SARS-CoV-2 testing. When collection of a nasopharyngeal swab is not possible, the following are acceptable alternatives:
An oropharyngeal (OP) specimen collected by a healthcare professional, or
A nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab collected by a healthcare professional or by onsite self-collection (using a flocked tapered swab), or
An anterior nares specimen collected by a healthcare professional or by onsite self-collection (using a round foam swab).
CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not recommended. When it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen.
Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a decision has been made to pursue COVID-19 testing, regardless of the time of symptom onset. Maintain proper infection control when collecting specimens. See Biosafety FAQs for handling and processing specimens from suspected case patients.
Store specimens at 2-8°C and ship overnight to CDC on ice pack. Label each specimen container with the patient’s ID number (e.g., medical record number), unique specimen ID (e.g., laboratory requisition number), specimen type (e.g., serum) and the date the sample was collected. Complete a CDC Form 50.34 for each specimen submitted. In the upper left box of the form, 1) for test requested select “Respiratory virus molecular detection (non-influenza) CDC-10401” and 2) for At CDC, bring to the attention of enter “Stephen Lindstrom: 2019-nCoV PUI”.
Use only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts. Do not use calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts, as they may contain substances that inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR testing. Place swabs immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 ml of viral transport media.  In general CDC is now recommending collecting only the NP swab.   If both swabs are used, NP and OP specimens should be combined at collection into a single vial. OP swabs remain an acceptable specimen type.
. Store specimens at 2-8°C and ship overnight to CDC on ice pack. If a specimen is frozen at -70°C ship overnight to CDC on dry ice. Additional useful and detailed information on packing, shipping, and transporting specimens can be found at Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

A: Standard Precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, nonintact skin, mucous membranes, and excretions (except sweat) may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions include hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection.
• 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings
• CDC Isolation Precautions
Q: What are infectious aerosols and droplets?
A: Aerosols and droplets containing particles that are <100 μm in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. Laboratory workers may not be aware that such particles can be generated during many laboratory procedures and that these particles could be inhaled or could cross-contaminate work surfaces, materials, and equipment.
Infectious aerosols are small liquid or solid particles suspended in the air that contain infectious agents. They can disperse throughout the laboratory and remain infective over time and distance. These particles are of a size that may be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract (<5 μm in diameter). Examples of organisms transmitted by aerosols include spores of Aspergillus spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rubeola virus (measles), and varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox).
Droplets traditionally are defined as larger infectious particles (>5 μm in diameter) that rapidly fall out of the air, contaminating gloves, the immediate work area, and the mucous membranes of the persons performing the procedure.
Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include Bordetella pertussis, influenza viruses, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), group A streptococcus, and Neisseria meningitidis.
• 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings
• CDC Isolation Precautions
Q: What procedures can generate aerosols and droplets?
A: Many routine laboratory procedures can potentially generate aerosols and droplets that are often undetectable. The following laboratory procedures have been associated with the generation of infectious aerosols and droplets: centrifugation, pipetting, vortexing, mixing, shaking, sonicating, removing caps, decanting liquids, preparing smears, flaming slides, aliquoting and loading specimens, loading syringes, manipulating needles, syringes or sharps, aspirating and transferring blood and body fluids, subculturing blood culture bottles, spilling specimens, and cleaning up spills.

Release of Stockpiled N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators Beyond the Manufacturer-Designated Shelf Life: Considerations for the COVID-19 Response
Some U.S. stockpiles include N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95s) that have exceeded their manufacturer-designated shelf life. U.S. Government decision makers are considering whether these products should be released for use during the COVID-19 response. Information is provided below that may be used to inform these product release decisions. In times of respiratory protective device shortage, such as during the COVID-19 response, supplies must be managed so that protection against exposure is adequate.
A study to evaluate stockpiled N95s from 10 geographically dispersed facilities with a range of storage conditions is underway by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This study includes data from 11 different N95 models. Ten reports detailing the performance results of respirators sampled from these 10 facilities are available on the NIOSH webpage. All N95 units evaluated in this study were manufactured between 2003 and 2013. Many have exceeded their manufacturer-designated shelf life. Testing was done in accordance with NIOSH performance standards for filtration efficiency and inhalation/exhalation resistance. Additional work to assess N95 fit testing is also included in the study, although a fit assessment is not a requirement for NIOSH approval of N95s.
In times of increased demand and decreased supply, consideration can be made to use the N95s listed above past their manufacturer-designated shelf life when responding to COVID-19.
In times of increased demand and decreased supply, consideration can be given to use the N95s listed above past their manufacturer-designated shelf life when responding to COVID-19. Although this preliminary information from the NIOSH study suggests certain N95 models beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life[ii] will be protective, CDC recommends that N95s that have exceeded their manufacturer-designated shelf life should be used only as outlined in the Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators
The respirators exceeding their manufacturer-designated shelf life are only being released due to the potential urgent demand caused by the COVID-19 public health emergency. In the face of this emergency, the U.S. Government believes that the respirators beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life should provide greater respiratory protection than surgical masks (i.e., medical masks) alone, improvised mouth and nose covers (e.g., bandanas), or no protection at all. Please note that surgical N95s are normally tested for fluid resistance and flammability. These requirements were not evaluated in this study. CDC does not recommend using N95s beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life in surgical settings.
Prior to using these expired respirators, consideration should be given to acquiring other NIOSH-approved respirators including all types of filtering facepiece respirators, elastomeric respirators, or powered air purifying respirators as described in the Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators. This recommendation is made because healthcare services are essential and must continue in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak. Users of N95s that have exceeded the manufacturer-designated shelf life should be notified before their use and the importance of inspection and user seal checks should be reemphasized.

Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings
Limit how germs can enter the facility. Cancel elective procedures, use telemedicine when possible, limit points of entry and manage visitors, screen patients for respiratory symptoms, encourage patient respiratory hygiene using alternatives to facemasks (e.g., tissues to cover cough).
Isolate symptomatic patients as soon as possible. Set up separate, well-ventilated triage areas, place patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in private rooms with door closed and private bathroom (as possible), prioritize AIIRs for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures.
Protect healthcare personnel. Emphasize hand hygiene, install barriers to limit contact with patients at triage, cohort COVID-19 patients, limit the numbers of staff providing their care, prioritize respirators and AIIRs for aerosol-generating procedures, implement PPE optimization strategies to extend supplies.

9. Train and Educate Healthcare Personnel
11. Establish Reporting within and between Healthcare Facilities and to Public Health Authorities
Healthcare Personnel (HCP)
For the purposes of this document, HCP refers to all paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials, including:
contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment
This interim guidance has been updated based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns. Here is what is currently known:
This guidance is applicable to all U.S. healthcare settings. This guidance is not intended for non-healthcare settings (e.g., schools) OR for persons outside of healthcare settings. For recommendations regarding clinical management, air or ground medical transport, or laboratory settings, refer to the main CDC COVID-19 website.
Mode of transmission: Early reports suggest person-to-person transmission most commonly happens during close exposure to a person infected with COVID-19, primarily via respiratory droplets produced when the infected person coughs or sneezes. Droplets can land in the mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs of those within close proximity. The contribution of small respirable particles, sometimes called aerosols or droplet nuclei, to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. However, airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely.
Major distributors in the United States have reported shortages of PPE, specifically N95 respirators, facemasks, and gowns. Healthcare facilities are responsible for protecting their HCP from exposure to pathogens, including by providing appropriate PPE.
In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).
The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.
Capacity across the healthcare continuum: Use of N95 or higher-level respirators are recommended for HCP who have been medically cleared, trained, and fit-tested, in the context of a facility’s respiratory protection program
. The majority of nursing homes and outpatient clinics, including hemodialysis facilities, do not have respiratory protection programs nor have they fit-tested HCP, hampering implementation of recommendations in the previous version of this guidance. This can lead to unnecessary transfer of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 to another facility (e.g., acute care hospital) for evaluation and care. In areas with community transmission, acute care facilities will be quickly overwhelmed by transfers of patients who have only mild illness and do not require hospitalization.
Many of the recommendations described in this guidance (e.g., triage procedures, source control) should already be part of an infection control program designed to prevent transmission of seasonal respiratory infections. As it will be challenging to distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory infections, interventions will need to be applied broadly and not limited to patients with confirmed COVID-19.
This guidance is applicable to all U.S. healthcare settings. This guidance is not intended for non-healthcare settings (e.g., schools) OR for persons outside of healthcare settings. For recommendations regarding clinical management, air or ground medical transport, or laboratory settings, refer to the main CDC COVID-19 website.
Definition of Healthcare Personnel (HCP) –For the purposes of this document, HCP refers to all paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials, including body substances; contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; contaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air.
Ensure facility policies and practices are in place to minimize exposures to respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Measures should be implemented before patient arrival, upon arrival, throughout the duration of the patient’s visit, and until the patient’s room is cleaned and disinfected. It is particularly important to protect individuals at increased risk for adverse outcomes from COVID-19 (e.g. older individuals with comorbid conditions), including HCP who are in a recognized risk category.
When scheduling appointments for routine medical care (e.g., annual physical, elective surgery), instruct patients to call ahead and discuss the need to reschedule their appointment if they develop symptoms of a respiratory infection (e.g., cough, sore throat, fever1) on the day they are scheduled to be seen.
If the patient must come in for an appointment, instruct them to call beforehand to inform triage personnel that they have symptoms of a respiratory infection (e.g., cough, sore throat, fever1) and to take appropriate preventive actions (e.g., follow triage procedures, wear a facemask upon entry and throughout their visit or, if a facemask cannot be tolerated, use a tissue to contain respiratory secretions).
If a patient is arriving via transport by emergency medical services (EMS), EMS personnel should contact the receiving emergency department (ED) or healthcare facility and follow previously agreed upon local or regional transport protocols. This will allow the healthcare facility to prepare for receipt of the patient.
Take steps to ensure all persons with symptoms of COVID-19 or other respiratory infection (e.g., fever, cough) adhere to respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette (see appendix), hand hygiene, and triage procedures throughout the duration of the visit.
Provide supplies for respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, including alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) with 60-95% alcohol, tissues, and no-touch receptacles for disposal, at healthcare facility entrances, waiting rooms, and patient check-ins.
Ensure rapid safe triage and isolation of patients with symptoms of suspected COVID-19 or other respiratory infection (e.g., fever, cough).
Prioritize triage of patients with respiratory symptoms.
Triage personnel should have a supply of facemasks and tissues for patients with symptoms of respiratory infection. These should be provided to patients with symptoms of respiratory infection at check-in. Source control (putting a facemask over the mouth and nose of a symptomatic patient) can help to prevent transmission to others.
Ensure that, at the time of patient check-in, all patients are asked about the presence of symptoms of a respiratory infection and history of travel to areas experiencing transmission of COVID-19 or contact with possible COVID-19 patients.
In some settings, patients might opt to wait in a personal vehicle or outside the healthcare facility where they can be contacted by mobile phone when it is their turn to be evaluated.
Incorporate questions about new onset of respiratory symptoms into daily assessments of all admitted patients. Monitor for and evaluate all new fevers and respiratory illnesses among patients. Place any patient with unexplained fever or respiratory symptoms on appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions and evaluate.
Learn more about how healthcare facilities can Prepare for Community Transmission
Designate an area at the facility (e.g., an ancillary building or temporary structure) or identify a location in the area to be a “respiratory virus evaluation center” where patients with fever or respiratory symptoms can seek evaluation and care.
Cancel group healthcare activities (e.g., group therapy, recreational activities).
Standard Precautions assume that every person is potentially infected or colonized with a pathogen that could be transmitted in the healthcare setting. Elements of Standard Precautions that apply to patients with respiratory infections, including COVID-19, are summarized below. Attention should be paid to training and proper donning (putting on), doffing (taking off), and disposal of any PPE. This document does not emphasize all aspects of Standard Precautions (e.g., injection safety) that are required for all patient care; the full description is provided in the Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings.
HCP (see Section 5 for measures for non-HCP visitors) who enter the room of a patient with known or suspected COVID-19 should adhere to Standard Precautions and use a respirator or facemask, gown, gloves, and eye protection. When available, respirators (instead of facemasks) are preferred; they should be prioritized for situations where respiratory protection is most important and the care of patients with pathogens requiring Airborne Precautions (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella). Information about the recommended duration of Transmission-Based Precautions is available in the Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19
HCP should perform hand hygiene by using ABHR with 60-95% alcohol or washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are visibly soiled, use soap and water before returning to ABHR.
Healthcare facilities should ensure that hand hygiene supplies are readily available to all personnel in every care location.
how to properly dispose of or disinfect and maintain PPE
Any reusable PPE must be properly cleaned, decontaminated, and maintained after and between uses. Facilities should have policies and procedures describing a recommended sequence for safely donning and doffing PPE. The PPE recommended when caring for a patient with known or suspected COVID-19 includes:
If reusable respirators (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) are used, they must be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer’s reprocessing instructions prior to re-use.
When the supply chain is restored, facilities with a respiratory protection program should return to use of respirators for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Those that do not currently have a respiratory protection program, but care for patients with pathogens for which a respirator is recommended, should implement a respiratory protection program.
Reusable eye protection (e.g., goggles) must be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer’s reprocessing instructions prior to re-use. Disposable eye protection should be discarded after use.
Put on a clean isolation gown upon entry into the patient room or area. Change the gown if it becomes soiled. Remove and discard the gown in a dedicated container for waste or linen before leaving the patient room or care area. Disposable gowns should be discarded after use. Cloth gowns should be laundered after each use.
For patients with COVID-19 or other respiratory infections, evaluate need for hospitalization. If hospitalization is not medically necessary, home care is preferable if the individual’s situation allows.
If admitted, place a patient with known or suspected COVID-19 in a single-person room with the door closed. The patient should have a dedicated bathroom.
Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (AIIRs) (See definition of AIIR in appendix) should be reserved for patients who will be undergoing aerosol-generating procedures (See Aerosol-Generating Procedures Section)
As a measure to limit HCP exposure and conserve PPE, facilities could consider designating entire units within the facility, with dedicated HCP, to care for known or suspected COVID-19 patients. Dedicated means that HCP are assigned to care only for these patients during their shift.
Determine how staffing needs will be met as the number of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 increases and HCP become ill and are excluded from work.
It might not be possible to distinguish patients who have COVID-19 from patients with other respiratory viruses. As such, patients with different respiratory pathogens will likely be housed on the same unit. However, only patients with the same respiratory pathogen may be housed in the same room. For example, a patient with COVID-19 should not be housed in the same room as a patient with an undiagnosed respiratory infection.
During times of limited access to respirators or facemasks, facilities could consider having HCP remove only gloves and gowns (if used) and perform hand hygiene between patients with the same diagnosis (e.g., confirmed COVID-19) while continuing to wear the same eye protection and respirator or facemask (i.e., extended use). Risk of transmission from eye protection and facemasks during extended use is expected to be very low.
HCP should strictly follow basic infection control practices between patients (e.g., hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfecting shared equipment).
Limit transport and movement of the patient outside of the room to medically essential purposes.
To the extent possible, patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should be housed in the same room for the duration of their stay in the facility (e.g., minimize room transfers).
Whenever possible, perform procedures/tests in the patient’s room.
Once the patient has been discharged or transferred, HCP, including environmental services personnel, should refrain from entering the vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available). After this time has elapsed, the room should undergo appropriate cleaning and surface disinfection before it is returned to routine use (See Section 10).
Some procedures performed on patient with known or suspected COVID-19 could generate infectious aerosols. In particular, procedures that are likely to induce coughing (e.g., sputum induction, open suctioning of airways) should be performed cautiously and avoided if possible.
Clean and disinfect procedure room surfaces promptly as described in the section on environmental infection control below.
When collecting diagnostic respiratory specimens (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab) from a possible COVID-19 patient, the following should occur:
Clean and disinfect procedure room surfaces promptly as described in the section on environmental infection control below.
Passively screen visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness before entering the healthcare facility
Visitors to the most vulnerable patients (e.g., oncology and transplant wards) should be limited; visitors should be screened for symptoms prior to entry to the unit.
Limit visitors to patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Encourage use of alternative mechanisms for patient and visitor interactions such as video-call applications on cell phones or tablets. If visitation must occur, visits should be scheduled and controlled to allow for the following:
Facilities should evaluate risk to the health of the visitor (e.g., visitor might have underlying illness putting them at higher risk for COVID-19) and ability to comply with precautions.
All visitors should be actively assessed for fever and respiratory symptoms upon entry to the facility. If fever or respiratory symptoms are present, visitor should not be allowed entry into the facility.
Design and install engineering controls to reduce or eliminate exposures by shielding HCP and other patients from infected individuals. Examples of engineering controls include:
8. Monitor and Manage Ill and Exposed Healthcare Personnel
Facilities and organizations providing healthcare should implement sick leave policies for HCP that are non-punitive, flexible, and consistent with public health guidance.
Movement and monitoring decisions for HCP with exposure to COVID-19 should be made in consultation with public health authorities. Refer to the Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for additional information.
9. Train and Educate Healthcare Personnel
Dedicated medical equipment should be used when caring for patients with known or suspected COVID-19.
All non-dedicated, non-disposable medical equipment used for patient care should be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies.
Ensure that environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly.
Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures (e.g., using cleaners and water to pre-clean surfaces prior to applying an EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectant to frequently touched surfaces or objects for appropriate contact times as indicated on the product’s label) are appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings, including those patient-care areas in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2.
Management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should also be performed in accordance with routine procedures.
Additional information about recommended practices for terminal cleaning of rooms and PPE to be worn by environmental services personnel is available in the Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control FAQs for COVID-19
11. Establish Reporting within and between Healthcare Facilities and to Public Health Authorities
Implement mechanisms and policies that promote situational awareness for facility staff including infection control, healthcare epidemiology, facility leadership, occupational health, clinical laboratory, and frontline staff about known or suspected COVID-19 patients and facility plans for response.
Communicate and collaborate with public health authorities.
Facilities should designate specific persons within the healthcare facility who are responsible for communication with public health officials and dissemination of information to HCP.
Communicate information about known or suspected COVID-19 patients to appropriate personnel before transferring them to other departments in the facility (e.g., radiology) and to other healthcare facilities.
12. Appendix: Additional Information about Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms, Respirators and Facemasks
Information about Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (AIIRs):
A respirator is a personal protective device that is worn on the face, covers at least the nose and mouth, and is used to reduce the wearer’s risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles (including dust particles and infectious agents), gases, or vapors. Respirators are certified by the CDC/NIOSH, including those intended for use in healthcare.
). HCP should be medically cleared and fit-tested if using respirators with tight-fitting facepieces (e.g., a NIOSH-approved N95 respirator) and trained in the proper use of respirators, safe removal and disposal, and medical contraindications to respirator use.
A commonly used respirator in healthcare settings is a filtering facepiece respirator (commonly referred to as an N95). FFRs are disposable half facepiece respirators that filter out particles.
Facemasks are cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as medical devices. Facemasks should be used once and then thrown away in the trash.

Frequently Asked Questions: Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control
Updated PPE recommendations for the care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19:
When the supply chain is restored, facilities with a respiratory protection program should return to use of respirators for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Facilities that do not currently have a respiratory protection program, but care for patients infected with pathogens for which a respirator is recommended, should implement a respiratory protection program.
Included are considerations for designating entire units within the facility, with dedicated HCP, to care for known or suspected COVID-19 patients and options for extended use of respirators, facemasks, and eye protection on such units.  Updated recommendations regarding need for an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR).
Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should be cared for in a single-person room with the door closed. Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (AIIRs) (See definition of AIIR in appendix) should be reserved for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures (See Aerosol-Generating Procedures Section)
Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.
Increased emphasis on early identification and implementation of source control (i.e., putting a face mask on patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory infection).

Frequently Asked Questions about Hand Hygiene for Healthcare Personnel Responding to COVID-2019
What method of hand hygiene is recommended for healthcare personnel in response to COVID-2019?
The CDC continues to recommend the use of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) as the primary method for hand hygiene in most clinical situations1. ABHR effectively reduces the number of pathogens that may be present on the hands of healthcare personnel after brief interactions with patients or the care environment. In addition, frequent use of ABHR formulated with emollients is less damaging to the skin than frequent hand washing. This factor, along with ease of use and greater access, leads to greater overall compliance with use of ABHR than hand washing with soap and water.  Hands should be washed for at least 20 seconds with soap and water when visibly soiled, before eating, and after using the restroom.
Are benzalkonium chloride-containing hand rub products an acceptable alternative to ABHR for COVID-19?
for use in the formulation of healthcare personnel hand rubs2.  However, available evidence indicates benzalkonium chloride has less reliable activity against coronavirus than either of the alcohols3.
How should healthcare organizations respond to severe shortages of ABHR?
Healthcare organizations that encounter severe shortages of ABHR (and have exhausted supply chain access to efficacious products) may consider local production of formulations as described by the FDA Policy for Compounding of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products
. This policy remains in effect through April 30, 2020. Formulations included in the FDA guidance are consistent with World Health Organization production guidance
. These locally produced products are intended for routine healthcare personnel hand cleaning, must not contain active ingredients other than those specified in the FDA guidance, and should not take the place of other regulated skin antiseptics (e.g. surgical hand rub). To avoid contamination with spore-forming organisms, WHO formulations require a 72-hour post-production quarantine. Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
Can healthcare facilities substitute unformulated ethanol in concentrations greater than 60% or isopropanol greater than 70% for use as alcohol-based hand rub?
Given the drying effect of alcohols and the importance of maintaining skin integrity of healthcare personnel with their need to perform hand hygiene frequently, alcohols should not be used unless properly formulated with emollients.

CDC Statement for Healthcare Personnel on Hand Hygiene during the Response to the International Emergence of COVID-19
CDC recommendations reflect the important role of hand hygiene for preventing the transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings for a wide range of pathogens. The ability of hand hygiene, including hand washing or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers to prevent infections is related to reductions in the number of viable pathogens that transiently contaminate the hands. Hand washing mechanically removes pathogens, while laboratory data demonstrate that 60% ethanol and 70% isopropanol, the active ingredients in CDC-recommended alcohol-based hand sanitizers, inactivates viruses that are genetically related to, and with similar physical properties as, the 2019-nCoV.
While the exact role of direct and indirect spread of coronaviruses between people that could be reduced by hand hygiene is unknown at this time, hand hygiene for infection prevention is an important part of the U.S. response to the international emergence of COVID-19.
CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with greater than 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol as the preferred form of hand hygiene in healthcare settings, based upon greater access to hand sanitizer. Health care providers who use alcohol-based hand sanitizers as part of their hand hygiene routine can inform patients that they are following CDC guidelines.

Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control FAQs for COVID-19
This page was updated on March 10, 2020 to align with the revised Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
Who is this for: Healthcare personnel who may care for patients who are confirmed with or under investigation for COVID-19.
What is it for: This creates FAQs to support the existing Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Guidance for COVID-19.
How is it used: To assist healthcare facilities in preventing transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare settings.
1. What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by individuals transporting patients who are confirmed with or under investigation for COVID-19 within a healthcare facility? For example, what PPE should be worn when transporting a patient to radiology for imaging that cannot be performed in the patient room?
In general, transport and movement of the patient outside of  their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet.
If the patient is wearing a facemask, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patient’s room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask).
Interim guidance for EMS personnel transporting patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is available here. EMS personnel should wear all recommended PPE because they are providing direct medical care and in close contact with the patient for longer periods of time.
2. What PPE should be worn by HCP providing care to asymptomatic patients with a history of exposure to COVID-19 who are being evaluated for a non-infectious complaint (e.g., hypertension or hyperglycemia)?
Standard Precautions should be followed when caring for any patient, regardless of suspected or confirmed COVID-19. If the patient is afebrile (temperature is less than 100.0oF) and otherwise without even mild symptoms* that might be consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., cough, sore throat, shortness of breath), then precautions specific to COVID-19 are not required. However, until the patient is determined to be without such symptoms, HCP should wear all recommended PPE for the patient encounter. If the primary evaluation confirms the patient is without symptoms, management and need for any Transmission-Based Precautions should be based with the condition for which they are being evaluated (e.g., patient colonized with a drug-resistant organism), rather than potential exposure to COVID-19.
This public health response is an important opportunity to reinforce the importance of strict adherence to Standard Precautions during all patient encounters. Standard Precautions are based on the principles that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions except sweat, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. The application of Standard Precautions is determined by the nature of the HCP-patient interaction and the extent of anticipated blood, body fluids, and pathogen exposure. For example, a facemask and eye protection should be worn during the care of any patient if splashes, sprays, or coughs could occur during the patient encounter. Similarly, gloves should be worn if contact with body fluids, mucous membranes, or nonintact skin are anticipated.
*Note: In addition to cough and shortness of breath, nonspecific symptoms such as sore throat, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea have been noted as initial symptoms in some cases of COVID-19. These symptoms can have several alternative explanations; however, failure to identify and implement proper precautions in a healthcare setting for persons infected with COVID-19 can contribute to widespread transmission in that facility due to the presence of susceptible patients and close interactions with healthcare personnel. For this reason, a lower temperature of 100.0oF and the inclusion of mild and non-specific symptoms should be used by healthcare settings evaluating these patients to increase the ability to detect even mild cases of COVID-19.
3. What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by environmental services (EVS) personnel who clean and disinfect rooms of hospitalized patients with COVID-19?
In general, only essential personnel should enter the room of patients with COVID-19. Healthcare facilities should consider assigning daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to nursing personnel who will already be in the room providing care to the patient. If this responsibility is assigned to EVS personnel, they should wear all recommended PPE when in the room. PPE should be removed upon leaving the room, immediately followed by performance of hand hygiene.
After discharge, terminal cleaning may be performed by EVS personnel. They should delay entry into the room until a sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. We do not yet know how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in the air. Regardless, EVS personnel should refrain from entering the vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available). After this time has elapsed, EVS personnel may enter the room and should wear a gown and gloves when performing terminal cleaning. A facemask and eye protection should be added if splashes or sprays during cleaning and disinfection activities are anticipated or otherwise required based on the selected cleaning products. Shoe covers are not recommended at this time for personnel caring for patients with COVID-19.
4. Where should nasopharyngeal swabs be performed on a known or suspected COVID-19 patient, and with what PPE?
The collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from patients with known or suspected COVID-19 can be performed in a regular examination room with the door closed. Use of an airborne infection isolation room for nasopharyngeal specimen collection is not required. HCP in the room should wear an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown. If respirators are not readily available, they should be prioritized for other procedures at higher risk for producing infectious aerosols (e.g., intubation), instead of for collecting NP swabs.
5. Do all patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be placed in airborne infection isolation rooms?
No. Updated CDC Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings recommends placing patients in a regular examination room with the door closed. Airborne infection isolation rooms should be reserved for patients undergoing aerosol generating procedures or for diagnoses such as active tuberculosis.
6. How long does an examination room need to remain vacant after being occupied by a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19?
Although spread of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be primarily via respiratory droplets, the contribution of small respirable particles to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. Airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely.
For these higher risk scenarios, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period as that used for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis) and to restrict HCP and patients without PPE from entering the room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles.
In addition to ensuring sufficient time for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles, HCP should clean and disinfect environmental surfaces and shared equipment before the room is used for another patient.

CDC Grows SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in Cell Culture
Virus isolates will be used for research by the scientific and medical community
One important way that CDC is supporting global efforts to study and learn about the virus that causes COVID-19 in the laboratory is growing the virus in cell-culture so that researchers in the scientific and medical community can use the virus in their studies.
On January 22, 2020, CDC received a clinical specimen collected from the first U.S. patient infected with SARS-CoV-2. CDC immediately placed the specimen into cell-culture in order to grow a sufficient amount of virus for study.
On February 2, 2020, CDC generated enough SARS-CoV-2 grown in cell culture to distribute externally.
On February 4, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was shipped from CDC to the BEI Resources Repository. The BEI Resources Repository is affiliated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is a central repository that supplies organisms and reagents to the broader community of microbiology and infectious disease researchers.
 expands the material that they received from CDC, CDC’s SARS-CoV-2 isolate can be requested by public and academic institutions that maintain appropriate facilities and safety programs, as well as have the appropriate expertise, as required by BEI. Some areas of COVID-19 research that public and academic institutions may study include:
Antiviral research: This includes research aimed at testing the ability of existing or experimental antiviral medications to treat or prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Pathogenesis research: This includes research to determine the various ways the virus can be transmitted to a host, the severity of illness it causes in a host, how much virus is produced in the body, and what organs the virus can spread to within the body.
Virus stability research: This is research that indicates how long the virus can survive under certain conditions, such as how long the virus can remain viable and infectious on surfaces, and the temperatures at which it can survive.

Cómo se propaga el COVID-19
Los conocimientos actuales sobre cómo se propaga el virus que causa la enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) se basan en su mayoría en lo que se sabe sobre coronavirus similares.
Se cree que el virus se propaga principalmente de persona a persona.
Podría ser posible que una persona contraiga el COVID-19 al tocar una superficie u objeto que tenga el virus y luego se toque la boca, la nariz o posiblemente los ojos, aunque no se cree que esta sea la principal forma en que se propaga el virus.
Podría ser posible que haya algo de propagación antes de que las personas presenten síntomas; ha habido informes sobre esto con relación a este nuevo coronavirus, aunque no se cree que esta sea la principal forma en que se propaga el virus.
¿Qué tan eficientemente se propaga el virus?
La facilidad con que se propaga un virus de persona a persona puede variar. Algunos virus son altamente contagiosos (como el sarampión), mientras que otros virus no lo son tanto. Otro factor es si la propagación continúa por múltiples generaciones de personas (si la propagación es continua). El virus que causa el COVID-19 parece estar propagándose fácilmente y en forma continua en la provincia de Hubei y otras partes de China. En los Estados Unidos, la propagación de persona a persona ha ocurrido solo entre unos pocos contactos cercanos y no se ha propagado mucho más hasta la fecha.
El COVID-19 es una enfermedad emergente y hay mucho más que aprender sobre su transmisibilidad, gravedad y otras características, y sobre lo que pasará en los Estados Unidos. La nueva información que se obtenga fundamentará más la evaluación de riesgos.

COVID-19 是如何传播的
目前对引起冠状病毒疾病 2019 (COVID-19) 的病毒是如何传播的理解很大程度上是基于对类似冠状病毒的了解。
一个人可能通过接触被病毒污染的表面或物体，然后接触自己的口、鼻或可能接触自己的眼睛而感染 COVID-19，但这并不被认为是病毒传播的主要方式。
病毒在人与人之间传播的容易程度可能各不相同。一些病毒具有高度传染性（如麻疹），而其他病毒的传染性较低。另一个因素是传播是否在多代人中持续（如果传播持续存在）。导致 COVID-19 的病毒似乎在湖北省和中国其他地区容易持续传播。在美国，人与人之间的传播只发生在少数密切接触者中，迄今没有进一步传播。
COVID-19 是一种新出现的疾病，关于其传播性、严重程度和其他特征以及对美国影响等的更多内容需要探索。新信息将进一步为风险评估提供信息。

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. More information on Are you at higher risk for serious illness?
There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.
Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.
Clean and disinfect
Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect:
Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. Use disinfectants appropriate for the surface.
Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.
Alcohol solutions.
Ensure solution has at least 70% alcohol.
Other common EPA-registered household disinfectants.
 claims are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).

How Coronavirus Spreads
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.
The President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America: 15 Days to Slow the Spread
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Can someone spread the virus without being sick?
Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
How easily the virus spreads
How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.
The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Different parts of the country are seeing different levels of COVID-19 activity. The United States nationally is in the initiation phase of the pandemic. States in which community spread is occurring are in the acceleration phase. The duration and severity of each pandemic phase can vary depending on the characteristics of the virus and the public health response.
CDC and state and local public health laboratories are testing for the virus that causes COVID-19. View CDC’s Public Health Laboratory Testing map.
All 50 states have reported cases of COVID-19 to CDC.
U.S. COVID-19 cases include:
Twenty-seven U.S. states are reporting some community spread of COVID-19.

CDC Tests for COVID-19
CDC has developed a new laboratory test kit for use in testing patient specimens for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. The test kit is called the “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel.” It is intended for use with the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast DX Real-Time PCR Instrument with SDS 1.4 software. This test is intended for use with upper and lower respiratory specimens collected from persons who meet CDC criteria for COVID-19 testing. CDC’s test kit is intended for use by laboratories designated by CDC as qualified, and in the United States, certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) to perform high complexity tests.
On Monday, February 3, 2020, CDC submitted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) package to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to expedite FDA permitted use of the CDC diagnostic panel in the United States. The EUA process enables FDA to consider and authorize the use of unapproved, but potentially life-saving medical or diagnostic products during a public health emergency. The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services declared the SARS-CoV-2 virus a U.S. public health emergency on Friday, January 31, 2020. FDA issued the EUA on February 4, 2020. IRR began distribution of the test kits to states, but shortly thereafter performance issues were identified related to a problem in the manufacturing of one of the reagents which led to laboratories not being able to verify the test performance. CDC is remanufacturing the reagents with more robust quality control measures. New tests will be distributed once this issue has been addressed. CDC continues to perform initial and confirmatory testing.
This is a picture of CDC’s laboratory test kit for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CDC tests are provided to U.S. state and local public health laboratories, Department of Defense (DOD) laboratories and select international laboratories.
Serology Test for COVID-19
CDC is working to develop a new laboratory test to assist with efforts to determine how much of the U.S. population has been exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19.
The serology test will look for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections.  Antibodies can be found in the blood and in other tissues of those who are tested after infection.  The antibodies detected by this test indicate that a person had an immune response to SARS-CoV-2, whether symptoms developed from infection or the infection was asymptomatic.  Antibody test results are important in detecting infections with few or no symptoms.
Initial work to develop a serology test for SARS-CoV-2 is underway at CDC.  In order to develop the test, CDC needs blood samples from people who had COVID-19 at least 21 days after their symptoms first started. Researchers are currently working to develop the basic parameters for the test, which will be refined as more samples become available. Once the test is developed, CDC will need additional samples to evaluate whether the test works as intended.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. More information on Are you at higher risk for serious illness?
There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.
Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.
Clean and disinfect
Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect:
Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. Use disinfectants appropriate for the surface.
Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.
Alcohol solutions.
Ensure solution has at least 70% alcohol.
Other common EPA-registered household disinfectants.
 claims are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
How Coronavirus Spreads
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.
The President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America: 15 Days to Slow the Spread
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Can someone spread the virus without being sick?
Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
How easily the virus spreads
How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.
The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Different parts of the country are seeing different levels of COVID-19 activity. The United States nationally is in the initiation phase of the pandemic. States in which community spread is occurring are in the acceleration phase. The duration and severity of each pandemic phase can vary depending on the characteristics of the virus and the public health response.
CDC and state and local public health laboratories are testing for the virus that causes COVID-19. View CDC’s Public Health Laboratory Testing map.
All 50 states have reported cases of COVID-19 to CDC.
U.S. COVID-19 cases include:
Twenty-seven U.S. states are reporting some community spread of COVID-19.

Updated core disinfection/cleaning guidance
There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is currently known about the virus, and about similar coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, but disease transmission via infectious aerosols is currently uncertain. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through fomites. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings.
It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection.  Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air.
This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of households where persons under investigation (PUI) or those with confirmed COVID-19 reside or may be in self- isolation. It is aimed at limiting the survival of the virus in the environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.
Disinfecting refers to using chemicals, for example, EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection.
General Recommendations for Routine Cleaning and Disinfection of Households
Community members can practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks, and electronics (see below for special electronics cleaning and disinfection instructions)) with household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants
For electronics follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.
General Recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection of Households with People Isolated in Home Care (e.g. Suspected/Confirmed to have COVID-19)
Household members should educate themselves about COVID-19 symptoms and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in homes.
Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, keyboards, handles, desks, toilets, sinks)
The caregiver can provide personal cleaning supplies for an ill person’s room and bathroom, unless the room is occupied by child or another person for whom such supplies would not be appropriate. These supplies include tissues, paper towels, cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants (see examples
If a separate bathroom is not available, the bathroom should be cleaned and disinfected after each use by an ill person. If this is not possible, the caregiver should wait as long as practical after use by an ill person to clean and disinfect the high-touch surfaces.
Household members should follow home care guidance when interacting with persons with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 and their isolation rooms/bathrooms.
How to clean and disinfect:
Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.
If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.
A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here
. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products for (concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Additionally, diluted household bleach solutions (at least 1000ppm sodium hypochlorite) can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute, and allowing proper ventilation during and after application. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.
Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.
If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.
Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and then discard after each use. If using reusable gloves, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other household purposes. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.
If possible, do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.
Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If possible, consider placing a bag liner that is either disposable (can be thrown away) or can be laundered.
Household members should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.
Consider consulting with your local health department about trash disposal guidance if available.

Interim Guidance: Public Health Communicators Get Your Community Ready for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this interim guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available.
Before a COVID-19 outbreak occurs: Plan
During a COVID-19 outbreak: Act
After a COVID-19 outbreak has ended: Follow Up
This interim guidance is intended for state and local public health information officers, health communication specialists, health educators, and other public health professionals responsible for planning communication strategies before, during, and after an outbreak of corognavirus disease (COVID-19).
This guidance provides information about nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and their use during a COVID-19 outbreak. NPIs are actions, apart from getting vaccinated and taking antiviral medications, that people and communities can take to help slow the spread of respiratory illnesses like COVID-19.
COVID-19 is an emerging disease and there is more to learn about its transmission, severity, and how it will take shape in the United States. Everyone can do their part to help plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat.
CDC has developed recommendations for how to communicate with people in your community about a COVID-19 outbreak. The Before, During, and After sections of this guide offer suggested strategies to help you plan for and implement these recommendations.

CDC has developed recommendations for how to communicate with people in your community about a COVID-19 outbreak. The Before, During, and After sections of this guide offer suggested strategies to help you plan for and implement these recommendations.
Before a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community: Plan
A good emergency communication plan encourages community leaders and stakeholders to plan now for a COVID-19 outbreak and other types of emergencies. Before an outbreak occurs, focus on raising awareness and educating audiences about nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and other public health respiratory infection-prevention strategies. Identify key community relationships and leverage them to help educate and prepare audiences. It takes time to build relationships. Engage internal and external partners and stakeholders early in your planning process. Coordinating your planning efforts with them can help establish strong lines of communication and ensure that information is consistent before and during a COVID-19 outbreak in your community.
Become familiar with key COVID-19 prevention messages and NPI recommendations
Read and understand “Everyday Preventive Actions”. This list identifies personal health habits that people should use all the time, including to help protect themselves and their families against COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses.
Read and understand CDC’s audience-specific COVID-19 NPI guidance documents and communication materials. Tailored guidance and resources addressing COVID-19 planning are available for individuals and communities.
Take CDC’s NPI 101 Web-based training. State, tribal, local, and territorial public health officials can complete an interactive course (developed by CDC for pandemic influenza preparedness) to increase their understanding of NPIs and how to plan for the use of NPIs before, during, and after a pandemic to help slow spread of disease. The NPI training
 is applicable to COVID-19. Register for “NPI 101” External on CDC TRAIN. The following free CE credits are provided: 0.2 CEU/CE, 1.5 CHES, 1.75 CME, 1.5 CNE Contact Hours, and 2 CPHCE.
Update your existing emergency communication plan
Meet with your existing emergency planning and operations team to update the emergency communication plan for your state or local community.
Develop or update your plan based on various scenarios your state or local community may face during a COVID-19 outbreak.
Identify everyone in your chain of communication (e.g., new and existing partners and stakeholders, others in your own agency, and other health departments), and create or update a comprehensive contact list.
Help community members prepare for COVID-19
Encourage community members to plan for COVID-19.
Promote the practice of everyday preventive actions before an outbreak occurs (e.g., staying home when sick, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue, washing hands often, and cleaning frequently touched surfaces). Identify up-to-date resources and tools to household members plan and prepare for COVID-19.
Create a COVID-19 communication workgroup with representatives from key partners and stakeholders.
Include communication, marketing, and public relations professionals who work in various community settings, such as childcare programs, healthcare facilities, pharmacies, schools, workplaces, community- and faith-based organizations, and public and private organizations.
Discuss with the workgroup the emergency communication plan for your state or local community.
Determine how to coordinate COVID-19 outbreak communication between workgroup members. Encourage their participation in other community-wide COVID-19 readiness activities.
Note: Inform workgroup members about workshops, programs, and other activities they can implement within their organizations to inspire the public to consistently practice good personal health habits and prepare for emergencies.
Engage communities in a dialogue about COVID-19 readiness.
Conduct needs assessments or focus groups with community members to gather information about their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and challenges related to NPIs and COVID-19. Use their feedback to improve your communication strategies, messages, and materials.
Note: Work closely with workgroup members and key partners and stakeholders to address COVID-19 readiness challenges and barriers identified by audiences in your community. Identifying solutions to help audiences move past barriers may help people change habits and better adapt to changing circumstances during an outbreak.
Note: Some NPI actions may draw public attention and can have negative psychosocial and economic consequences on groups and individuals to which they are applied during an outbreak, especially to high-risk and vulnerable populations. Include in your communication plan strategies and messages that address fear, stigmatization, and discrimination.
Ensure communicators across sectors have the necessary skills and understanding to develop emergency communication plans and promote COVID-19 readiness within their organizations.
Become a resource for COVID-19 information.
Visit CDC’s website for messages and materials about NPIs and COVID-19. Visit CDC’s Health Literacy page for more information about plain language.
Assess procedures and technology resources needed for timely communication during a COVID-19 outbreak
Make sure information is accurate and consistent during an emergency and flows promptly and frequently to the correct audiences.
Note: Communication after-action reports and improvement plans (AARs/IPs) from recent public health emergency responses can offer practical and helpful insights.
If needed resources do not exist inside your organization, create a plan for acquiring them or identify sources from which you can access technology during a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for the dissemination of COVID-19 information
Experts who will serve as spokespersons should be experienced in public health emergencies and COVID-19. Include representatives from limited English-speaking communities.
Emergency Risk Communication: By Leaders
Develop a communication evaluation plan. Use these questions to help you measure the effectiveness of your emergency communication plan:
Can you confirm that timely information is being provided throughout the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak?
Test and update your emergency communication plan.
Ensure systems and procedures support communication activities needed during a COVID-19 outbreak.
Encourage workgroup members to test the emergency communication plans for their organizations.
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community: Act
Maintain ongoing communication with your workgroup members, partners, and stakeholders once COVID-19 is in your local community. Coordinate COVID-19 communication activities with news media and other channels to ensure consistent messaging. If you must use technical terminology and concepts, be sure to define them and include examples to help improve understanding. For example, create messages that clearly explain COVID-19 and NPIs.
Your communication should be early, empathetic, accurate, and effective. Early communication of COVID-19 information helps limit misinformation and rumors that could contribute to confusion and fear. Empathetic communication conveys concern and reassurance, empowers people, and reduces emotional turmoil. Accurate communication provides the facts about a situation and what is being done to resolve it. Effective communication helps build understanding and guide the public, media, healthcare providers, and other groups in responding to COVID-19 and complying with public health recommendations.
Put your emergency plan into action
Stay informed about the COVID-19 situation.
Visit the CDC website to get up-to-date information about COVID-19.
Explain why NPIs are necessary and effective when implemented early and practiced throughout an outbreak. Give details about what, how, when, and where NPIs will be implemented in the community.
To learn more about NPIs as an important community mitigation measure, visit Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza — United States, 2017. Visit CDC’s Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) website for more information about communicating during an emergency.
Provide frequent updates to the public to ensure they understand their risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 and how to reduce their risk.
Encourage people to stay home and away from others when they are sick, to practice good health habits, and to comply with CDC or local public health recommendations to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Be transparent and share what is known and unknown about the COVID-19 situation in your state or local community.
Use a variety of communication channels to distribute audience-specific health messages and materials.
Provide additional resources and web links where the public can find reliable NPI and COVID-19 information. See Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication: Spokesperson
Communicate COVID-19 prevention information to those who are vulnerable and at high risk for complications.
Learn how community- and faith-based organizations can help vulnerable populations during an outbreak.
After a COVID-19 outbreak has ended in your community: Follow Up
Health communicators can distribute well-designed information that achieves behavior change
Work with workgroup members to identify criteria for phasing out and ending COVID-19 prevention communication activities. Maintain an attitude of preparedness by continuing to collaborate with workgroup members, partners, and stakeholders to enhance their communication skills on COVID-19 readiness and other public health issues. Use data from the response to identify new communication strategies and campaigns to facilitate long-term behavior change.
Evaluate the effectiveness your emergency communication plan
Maintain and expand your COVID-19 communication workgroup.
Identify trusted representatives from the community and federal, state, or local agencies or organizations needed to help you prepare for COVID-19.
The timing of a COVID-19 outbreak cannot be predicted but having a plan in place is very important. Communication is an essential part of any successful public health response. Coordinate your planning activities with internal and external partners and stakeholders to help prepare your community for COVID-19 and achieve your emergency communication goals and objectives.

Interim Guidance for Public Health Professionals Managing People With COVID-19 in Home Care and Isolation Who Have Pets or Other Animals
This document is based on the limited available data as of the release date and general recommendations for zoonotic disease infection prevention and control. This is a rapidly evolving situation. Guidance will be updated as new information becomes available. States may have their own specific requirements for these circumstances.
This interim guidance is for public health professionals managing the home care and isolation of people with COVID-19 who have pets or other animals (including service or working animals) in the same home. The intent of this guidance is to facilitate preparedness and establish practices that can help people and animals stay safe and healthy. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19.
Household animals, for the purposes of this document, refers to companion animals, including pets and service animals, that live in a home or on the premises of a home. This document does not address instances where a person with COVID-19 interacts with livestock (e.g., pigs, goats, sheep or cattle), wildlife, or other animals on their premises or through duties outside their home.
Public health veterinarian, for the purposes of this document, refers to the state public health veterinarian or designated public health official responsible for handling animal-related public health issues in their jurisdiction.
When to Contact a State Public Health Veterinarian
A state public health veterinarian
should be contacted by public health professionals, animal health professionals or veterinarians that have discovered a household animal with a new, concerning illness and that resides with a person with COVID-19. Some jurisdictions do not have state public health veterinarians, or geographic, resource, or time limitations may prevent public health veterinarian from managing a situation involving household animals.
In addition to other prevention measures, people with COVID-19 and in-home isolation should be advised to limit interaction with household animals. Specifically, while a person infected with COVID-19 is symptomatic, they should maintain separation from household animals as they would with other household members, and avoid direct contact with pets, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, sleeping in the same location, and sharing food. In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act
, service animals should be permitted to remain with their handlers. If possible, a household member should be designated to care for pets in the home and should follow standard handwashing practices before and after interacting with the household animal. If a person with COVID-19 must care for pets, they should ensure they wash their hands before and after caring for pets.
Care for household animals that are sick or injured should be coordinated with the household’s local veterinarian. In order to ensure the veterinary clinic is prepared for the household animal, the owner should call ahead and arrange the hospital or clinic visit. If an owner is sick with COVID-19, a family member or friend from outside the household may bring the animal to a veterinary hospital or clinic. Telemedicine may also be appropriate to provide consultation with a veterinarian if the owner is a COVID-19 case and is unable to find an alternative caretaker to bring the pet to the hospital. Veterinarians that see animals that have a new, concerning illness and reside with a person with COVID-19 should contact their state public health veterinarian
In some instances, household animals may require alternative care or re-homing if the owner is unable to care for the animal or has surrendered the animal. A home receiving a new household animal should follow standard handwashing practices before and after interacting with the animal. Shelters receiving household animals should ensure they review and adhere to their established biosafety and biosecurity practices for infectious diseases.
At this time there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can become sick with or spread COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread to people from the skin or fur of companion animals.
Veterinarians and their staff should review and adhere to their biosafety and biosecurity protocols for infectious diseases to ensure the safety of their patients.
Veterinarians and their staff should review the concepts in NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions for Zoonotic Disease Prevention in Veterinary Personnel
. This document outlines routine infection prevention practices designed to minimize transmission of zoonotic pathogens from animals to veterinary personnel.
These infection prevention and control guidelines should be consistently implemented in veterinary hospitals, regardless of ongoing outbreaks of infectious diseases, but are especially important during an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as COVID-19.
Contact your state public health veterinarian
if you are seeing a new, concerning illness in an animal that has had close contact with a person with COVID-19.

Information for Health Departments on Reporting Cases of COVID-19
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. To prevent further spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to collect information to better understand the virus and its impact on health outcomes, CDC has developed a form that provides a standardized approach to reporting COVID-19 cases (individuals with at least one respiratory specimen that tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19). These data are needed to track the impact of the outbreak and inform public health response.
The COVID-19 Case Report Form
 is designed to collect key information on COVID-19 case-patients, including:
Additional resources to assist in the completion and analysis of the COVID-19 Case Report Form are available:
COVID-19 Case Report Form Instructions
Healthcare providers who are concerned that a patient may have COVID-19 should contact their local
 health department immediately.
For reporting jurisdictions who are able to assign nCoV IDs for COVID-19 case-patients and use CDC’s electronic reporting system: The jurisdiction should enter all cases into CDC’s electronic reporting system with the jurisdiction-issued nCoV ID, unless other arrangements to transmit data have been made and approved by CDC. At this time, we ask that jurisdictions prioritize case reporting. However, jurisdictions can use the CDC’s electronic reporting system to manage PUI data based on their local needs.
Please refer to the following page for guidance on respiratory specimen collection, storage, and shipment (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html). Current CDC guidance recommends collection of a single respiratory nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. Please contact your state or territorial health department for more information on submitting reports of PUI COVID-19 cases.

Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposures: Geographic Risk and Contacts of Laboratory-confirmed Cases
Recommendations in this document for actions by public health authorities apply primarily to US jurisdictions that are not experiencing sustained community transmission. CDC will provide separate guidance for US jurisdictions with sustained community transmission.
CDC has provided separate guidance for healthcare settings.
Definitions for congregate settings and social distancing were revised
Clarified that in jurisdictions without sustained community transmission, decisions for public health action should be based priorities of public health authorities (e.g., surveillance, contact tracing)., In jurisdictions with sustained community transmission, travelers and other potentially exposed individuals should follow local guidance. Also provided a rationale for these changes.
Updated definitions for self-observation, self-monitoring, and self-monitoring with public health supervision
Added links to information on discontinuation of isolation for patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
Clarified that a potentially exposed person’s risk level does not change if symptoms develop
CDC is closely monitoring an epidemic of respiratory illness (COVID-19) caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  Chinese health officials have reported tens of thousands of illnesses with COVID-19 in China and the virus is spreading from person-to-person in many parts of that country. Cases of COVID-19 are also being reported in a growing number of international locations, several of which are experiencing sustained community-level or widespread person-to-person transmission. Cases of COVID-19 without direct links to travel have been reported in the United States and sustained transmission is occurring in some US communities.
The purpose of this interim guidance to provide public health authorities and other partners in US jurisdictions that are not experiencing sustained community transmission of COVID-19 with a framework for assessing and managing risk of potential exposures to SARS-CoV-2 and implementing public health actions based on a person’s risk level and clinical presentation. Public health actions may include monitoring or the application of movement restrictions, including isolation and quarantine, when needed to delay the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in these communities.
The recommendations in this guidance apply to US-bound travelers who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and people identified through contact investigations of laboratory-confirmed cases. CDC acknowledges that state and local jurisdictions may make risk management decisions that differ from those recommended here. Public health management decisions should be based on the situation in the jurisdiction and the priorities of public health authorities. The guidance will be updated based on the evolving circumstances of the epidemic.
The guidance was designed for a “containment” approach in the absence of sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission in US communities in order to delay introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2. It focuses on decreasing the risk of unrecognized case importation from international locations with sustained transmission and managing contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases. In US jurisdictions that are not experiencing sustained community transmission, these activities are still important; however, a resource-intense containment approach that focuses on international travelers poses a risk of diverting public health resources from other priority activities, including surveillance and case finding, contact tracing, and preparing for community mitigation measures. Allowing health departments the flexibility to prioritize public health actions in their jurisdictions enables prudent deployment of public health resources where they can have the most benefit based on the local situation. State and local health departments are best positioned to make such decisions within their jurisdictions.
In US jurisdictions with sustained community transmission, shifting from containment to mitigation conserves public health resources and directs them to where they can have the most benefit. In such jurisdictions, residents may have the same exposure risk as international travelers from countries with sustained transmission; therefore, applying stringent containment measures to international travelers (e.g., staying home for 14 days) no longer has a public health benefit and would be arbitrary in the context of similar risk among others in the community.  Applying such containment measures (e.g., asking people to stay home) community-wide would have severe detrimental effects on community infrastructure. When SARS-CoV-2 is spreading in a community, it is also not feasible to identify all people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or identify all potentially exposed contacts. Applying stringent containment measures to people who are tested and have laboratory confirmation and their contacts, but not to others who are not tested and their contacts, would have no public health benefit. Such an approach could hamper surveillance efforts and ability of public health authorities to make data-driven decisions for the implementation of community mitigation measures. Separate CDC guidance is in development that harmonizes recommendations for people who are tested and confirmed positive for COVID-19 and others in the community who are symptomatic but not tested, as well as their contacts.
Symptoms compatible with COVID-19, for the purpose of these recommendations, include subjective or measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.
Self-observation means people should remain alert for subjective fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. If they feel feverish or develop cough or difficulty breathing during the self-observation period, they should take their temperature, self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider or their local health department to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.
Self-monitoring means people should monitor themselves for fever by taking their temperatures twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing. If they feel feverish or develop measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing during the self-monitoring period, they should self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider or their local health department to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.
Self-monitoring with delegated supervision means, for certain occupational groups (e.g., some healthcare or laboratory personnel, airline crew members), self-monitoring with oversight by the appropriate occupational health or infection control program in coordination with the health department of jurisdiction. The occupational health or infection control personnel for the employing organization should establish points of contact between the organization, the self-monitoring personnel, and the local or state health departments with jurisdiction for the location where personnel will be during the self-monitoring period. This communication should result in agreement on a plan for medical evaluation of personnel who develop fever, cough, or difficulty breathing during the self-monitoring period. The plan should include instructions for notifying occupational health and the local public health authority, and transportation arrangements to a pre-designated hospital, if medically necessary, with advance notice if fever, cough, or difficulty breathing occur. The supervising organization should remain in contact with personnel through the self-monitoring period to oversee self-monitoring activities.
Self-monitoring with public health supervision means public health authorities assume the responsibility for oversight of self-monitoring for certain groups of people. The ability of jurisdictions to initiate or provide continued oversight will depend on other competing priorities (e.g., contact tracing, implementation of community mitigation strategies). Depending on local priorities, CDC recommends that health departments consider establishing initial communication with these people, provide a plan for self-monitoring and clear instructions for notifying the health department before the person seeks health care if they develop fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. As resources allow, health authorities may also check in intermittently with these people over the course of the self-monitoring period. If travelers for whom public health supervision is recommended are identified at a US port of entry, CDC will notify state and territorial health departments with jurisdiction for the travelers’ final destinations.
Active monitoring means that the state or local public health authority assumes responsibility for establishing regular communication with potentially exposed people to assess for the presence of fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. For people with high-risk exposures, CDC recommends this communication occurs at least once each day. The mode of communication can be determined by the state or local public health authority and may include telephone calls or any electronic or internet-based means of communication.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)
Public health orders are legally enforceable directives issued under the authority of a relevant federal, state, or local entity that, when applied to a person or group, may place restrictions on the activities undertaken by that person or group, potentially including movement restrictions or a requirement for monitoring by a public health authority, for the purposes of protecting the public’s health. Federal, state, or local public health orders may be issued to enforce isolation, quarantine or conditional release. The list of quarantinable communicable diseases for which federal public health orders are authorized is defined by Executive Order and includes “severe acute respiratory syndromes.” COVID-19 meets the definition for “severe acute respiratory syndromes” as set forth in Executive Order 13295, as amended by Executive Order 13375 and 13674, and, therefore, is a federally quarantinable communicable disease.
Isolation means the separation of a person or group of people known or reasonably believed to be infected with a communicable disease and potentially infectious from those who are not infected to prevent spread of the communicable disease. Isolation for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health order.
Quarantine in general means the separation of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease.
Conditional release defines a set of legally enforceable conditions under which a person may be released from more stringent public health movement restrictions, such as quarantine in a secure facility. These conditions may include public health supervision through in-person visits by a health official or designee, telephone, or any electronic or internet-based means of communication as determined by the CDC Director or state or local health authority. A conditional release order may also place limits on travel or require restriction of a person’s movement outside their home.
Controlled travel involves exclusion from long-distance commercial conveyances (e.g., aircraft, ship, train, bus). For people subject to active monitoring, any long-distance travel should be coordinated with public health authorities to ensure uninterrupted monitoring. Air travel is not allowed by commercial flight but may occur via approved noncommercial air transport. CDC may use public health orders or federal public health travel restrictions to enforce controlled travel. CDC also has the authority to issue travel permits to define the conditions of interstate travel within the United States for people under certain public health orders or if other conditions are met.
Social distancing means remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.
CDC has established the following exposure risk categories to help guide public health management of people following potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure in jurisdictions that are not experiencing sustained community transmission. These categories may not cover all potential exposure scenarios. They should not replace an individual assessment of risk for the purpose of clinical decision making or individualized public health management.
For country-level risk classifications, see Coronavirus Disease 2019 Information for Travel.
CDC has provided separate guidance for healthcare settings.
Table 1. Risk Categories for Exposures Associated with Travel or Identified during Contact Investigations of Laboratory-confirmed Cases
Table 1: Risk Categories for Exposures Associated with International Travel or Identified during Contact Investigations of Laboratory-confirmed Cases
High Not applicable Living in the same household as, being an intimate partner of, or providing care in a nonhealthcare setting (such as a home) for a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection without using recommended precautions for home care and home isolation
Close contact with a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
On an aircraft, being seated within 6 feet (two meters) of a traveler with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection; this distance correlates approximately with 2 seats in each direction
Living in the same household as, an intimate partner of, or caring for a person in a nonhealthcare setting (such as a home) to a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection while consistently using recommended precautions for home care and home isolation
Not applicable Being in the same indoor environment (e.g., a classroom, a hospital waiting room) as a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time but not meeting the definition of close contact
No identifiable risk Not applicable Interactions with a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection that do not meet any of the high-, medium- or low-risk conditions above, such as walking by the person or being briefly in the same room.
State and local authorities have primary jurisdiction for isolation and other public health orders within their respective jurisdictions. Federal public health authority primarily extends to international arrivals at ports of entry and to preventing interstate communicable disease threats.
CDC recognizes that decisions and criteria to use such public health measures may differ by jurisdiction. Consistent with principles of federalism, state and local jurisdictions may choose to make decisions about isolation, other public health orders, and monitoring that exceed those recommended in federal guidance. As the domestic COVID-19 situation evolves, public health authorities should base their decisions about application of individual-level monitoring or movement restrictions on the situation in their jurisdictions, including whether sustained community transmission is occurring and competing priorities.
The issuance of public health orders should be considered in the context of other less restrictive means that could accomplish the same public health goals. People under public health orders must be treated with respect, fairness, and compassion, and public health authorities should take steps to reduce the potential for stigma (e.g., through outreach to affected communities, public education campaigns). Considerable, thoughtful planning by public health authorities is needed to implement public health orders properly.  Specifically, measures must be in place to provide shelter, food, water, and other necessities for people whose movement is restricted under public health orders, and to protect their dignity and privacy.
CDC’s recommendations for public health management of international travelers with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and people identified through contact investigations of laboratory-confirmed cases, including monitoring and the application of travel or movement restrictions, are summarized in Table 2.
CDC and the Federal Aviation Administration have jointly provided interim health guidance for air carriers and crews
. This FAA-CDC guidance includes recommendations for air crews to self-monitor under the supervision of their employer’s occupational health program and to remain in their hotel rooms and practice social distancing while on overnight layovers in the United States (applies to US-based crews and crews based in other countries) or internationally (applies to US-based crews). These recommendations were made because SARS-CoV-2 is spreading in all regions internationally as well as in the United States. Also, the rapidly changing situation means country-level geographic risk assessments cannot be relied on to accurately judge the risk to crewmembers in any given location. As long as they remain asymptomatic, crew members may continue to work on flights into, within, or departing from the United States. Crew members who follow their carrier’s occupational health plan as well as the FAA-CDC guidance are not subject to restrictions applied to other travelers. If they develop fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, crew members should self-isolate and be excluded from work on commercial flights immediately, and remain excluded until cleared to work by their occupational health program and public health authorities.
Regardless of residence or travel history, crew members who have known exposure to persons with COVID-19 should be assessed and managed on a case-by-case basis.
Some personnel (e.g., emergency first responders) fill essential (critical) infrastructure roles within communities. Based on the needs of individual jurisdictions, and at the discretion of state or local health authorities, these personnel may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (either travel-associated or close contact to a confirmed case), provided they remain asymptomatic. Personnel who are permitted to work following an exposure should self-monitor under the supervision of their employer’s occupational health program including taking their temperature before each work shift to ensure they remain afebrile. On days these individuals are scheduled to work, the employer’s occupational health program could consider measuring temperature and assessing symptoms prior to their starting work. Exposed healthcare personnel who are considered part of critical infrastructure should follow existing CDC guidance.
People with Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19 and Symptomatic People Under Investigation for COVID-19
CDC has established criteria for determining when an individual can be considered non-infectious to guide discontinuation of transmission-based precautions for hospitalized patients or home isolation. While individuals are considered infectious, local or long-distance travel should occur only by medical transport (e.g., ambulance or air medical transport) or private vehicle. Isolation and travel restrictions are removed upon determination by public health authorities that the person is no longer considered to be infectious.
Symptomatic people who meet CDC’s definition of Persons Under Investigation (PUI) should be evaluated by healthcare providers in conjunction with local health authorities.  PUIs awaiting results of rRT-PCR testing for COVID-19 should remain in isolation at home or in a healthcare facility until their test results are known.  Depending on the clinical suspicion of COVID-19, PUIs for whom an initial rRT-PCR test is negative may be candidates for removal of any isolation and travel restrictions specific to symptomatic people, but any restrictions for asymptomatic people according to the assigned risk level should still apply.  Management decisions of PUIs who are not tested should be made on a case-by-case basis, using available epidemiologic and clinical information, in conjunction with CDC guidance.
Contacts of Asymptomatic People Exposed to COVID-19
CDC does not recommend testing, symptom monitoring or special management for people exposed to asymptomatic people with potential exposures to SARS-CoV-2 (such as in a household), i.e., “contacts of contacts;” these people are not considered exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
Table 2. Summary of CDC Recommendations for Management of Exposed Persons by Risk Level and Presence of Symptoms
The public health actions recommended in the table below apply to people who have been determined to have at least some risk for COVID-19. People who are being managed as asymptomatic in a particular risk level who develop signs or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 should be moved immediately into the symptomatic category in the same risk level and be managed accordingly. The risk level does not change if symptoms develop.
Risk Level Management if Asymptomatic Management if Symptomatic1
Quarantine (voluntary or under public health orders) in a location to be determined by public health authorities.
Immediate isolation with consideration of public health orders
Public health assessment to determine the need for medical evaluation; if medical evaluation warranted, diagnostic testing should be guided by CDC’s PUI definition
If medical evaluation is needed, it should occur with pre-notification to the receiving HCF and EMS, if EMS transport indicated, and with all recommended infection control precautions in place.
Controlled travel: Air travel only via air medical transport. Local travel is only allowed by medical transport (e.g., ambulance) or private vehicle while symptomatic person is wearing a face mask.
Practice social distancing

EMS = emergency medical services; HCF = healthcare facility; PUI = Person Under Investigation for COVID-19
Note: The public health management recommendations made above are primarily intended for jurisdictions not experiencing sustained community transmission. In jurisdictions not experiencing sustained community transmission, CDC recommends that post-exposure public health management for asymptomatic exposed individuals continue until 14 days after the last potential exposure; however, these decisions should be made based on the local situation, available resources, and competing priorities. These factors should also guide decisions about managing symptomatic exposed individuals.

Water Transmission and COVID-19
Can the COVID-19 virus spread through drinking water?
The COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.
Is the COVID-19 virus found in feces?
The virus that causes COVID-19 has been detected in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The amount of virus released from the body (shed) in stool, how long the virus is shed, and whether the virus in stool is infectious are not known.
The risk of transmission of COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person is also unknown. However, the risk is expected to be low based on data from previous outbreaks of related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). There have been no reports of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 to date.
Can the COVID-19 virus spread through pools and hot tubs?
There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools and hot tubs. Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (e.g., with chlorine and bromine) of pools and hot tubs should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.
Can the COVID-19 virus spread through sewerage systems?
CDC is reviewing all data on COVID-19 transmission as information becomes available. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through sewerage systems is thought to be low. Although transmission of COVID-19 through sewage may be possible, there is no evidence to date that this has occurred. This guidance will be updated as necessary as new evidence is assessed.
SARS, a similar coronavirus, has been detected in untreated sewage for up to 2 to 14 days. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, there was documented transmission associated with sewage aerosols. Data suggest that standard municipal wastewater system chlorination practices may be sufficient to inactivate coronaviruses, as long as utilities monitor free available chlorine during treatment to ensure it has not been depleted.
Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from the COVID-19 virus?
Wastewater treatment plant operations should ensure workers follow routine practices to prevent exposure to wastewater. These include using engineering and administrative controls, safe work practices, and PPE normally required for work tasks when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19–specific protections are recommended for employees involved in wastewater management operations, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.

Interim Guidance for Public Health Personnel Evaluating Persons Under Investigation (PUIs) and Asymptomatic Close Contacts of Confirmed Cases at Their Home or Non-Home Residential Settings
CDC guidance for COVID-19 may be adapted by state and local health departments to respond to rapidly changing local circumstances.
As part of the risk assessment and public health management of persons with potential COVID-19, public health personnel will typically conduct interviews and assess these individuals for fever or other symptoms of COVID-19. In certain circumstances they will also obtain respiratory specimens. This guidance is intended to address recommended infection prevention and control practices when these activities are performed at a home or non-home residential settings, which warrant additional considerations beyond those described for healthcare settings.
For recommendations on the evaluation of PUIs in healthcare settings refer to the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
Interviewing and assessing persons with symptoms (PUIs for COVID-19):
If public health personnel must interview a PUI in their home, the public health personnel should wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), including a gown, gloves, eye protection (e.g., goggles, a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face), and respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirator, as recommended in the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
Hand hygiene should be performed before putting on and after removing PPE using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol.
If unable to put on all PPE outside of the home, it is still preferred that face protection (i.e., respirator and eye protection) be put on before entering the home. Alert persons within the home that the public health personnel will be entering the home and ask them to move to a different room, if possible, or keep a 6-foot distance in the same room. Once the entry area is clear, enter the home and put on a gown and gloves.
PPE should ideally be removed outside of the home and discarded by placing in external trash can before departing location. PPE should not be taken from the PUI’s home in public health personnel’s vehicle.
If unable to remove all PPE outside of the home, it is still preferred that face protection (i.e., respirator and eye protection) be removed after exiting the home. If gown and gloves must be removed in the home, ask persons within the home to move to a different room, if possible, or keep a 6-foot distance in the same room. Once the entry area is clear, remove gown and gloves and exit the home. Once outside the home, perform hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, remove face protection and discard PPE by placing in external trash can before departing location. Perform hand hygiene again.
Interviewing and assessing persons without symptoms (asymptomatic close contacts who have been exposed to a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19):
Make every effort to interview the asymptomatic close contact by telephone, text monitoring system, or video conference.
If public health personnel must interview the asymptomatic close contact in person, the public health personnel should stay at least 6 feet away from the asymptomatic close contact and ask them if they have had fevers or respiratory symptoms. If the interview and assessment is occurring in the home environment, the public health personnel should not enter the home until these questions have been asked and the asymptomatic close contact has been determined to be afebrile by temperature measurement.
If the asymptomatic close contact reports fever or symptoms, they should be considered a PUI and referred for further medical evaluation as appropriate. Public health personnel should document temperature measurement and description of symptoms.
If the asymptomatic close contact does not report fever or symptoms, they should be instructed to take their own temperature and report the result. If the asymptomatic close contact denies symptoms and fever is not detected, it remains appropriate to stay at least 6 feet away during further interactions even if entering the home environment. If they are not able to take their own temperature, the public health personnel should:
Put on a facemask and eye protection (consider adding gloves if entering the asymptomatic close contact’s home)
Proceed with checking the asymptomatic close contact’s temperature
Perform hand hygiene using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol
Diagnostic respiratory specimen collection for all individuals (i.e., PUIs for COVID-19 or asymptomatic) at home:
Testing for the virus that causes COVID-19 should be conducted outdoors if climate allows. If conducted in the home, specimen collection should be performed in the area of the house where the individual being tested self-isolates.
Only the public health personnel and individual being tested should be in the room when testing is performed.
Public health personnel collecting specimens should wear recommended PPE, including a gown, gloves, eye protection, and respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirator, as recommended in the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
Hand hygiene should be performed before putting on and after removing PPE using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol.
If unable to put on all PPE outside of the home, it is still preferred that face protection (i.e., respirator and eye protection) be put on before entering the home. Alert persons within the home that the public health personnel will be entering the home and ask them to move to a different room, if possible, or keep a 6-foot distance in the same room. Once the entry area is clear, enter the home and put on a gown and gloves.
PPE should ideally be removed outside of the home and discarded by placing in external trash can before departing location. PPE should not be taken from the home of the person being tested in public health personnel’s vehicle.

A guide to help you make decisions and see appropriate medical care
There are laboratory tests that can identify the virus that causes COVID-19 in respiratory specimens. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. All of these tests are Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panels, that can provide results in 4 to 6 hours.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. Here is some information that might help in making decisions about seeking care or testing.
There is no treatment specifically approved for this virus.
CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians.
Clinicians should work with their state and local health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories, or work with clinical or commercial laboratories.
If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, try calling your state or local health department or a medical provider. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.
If you test positive for COVID-19, see If You Are Sick or Caring for Someone.
If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your specimen was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. It is possible that you were very early in your infection at the time of your specimen collection and that you could test positive later, or you could be exposed later and then develop illness. In other words, a negative test result does not rule out getting sick later.
CDC expects that widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur. In the coming months, most of the U.S. population will be exposed to this virus. You should continue to practice all the protective measures recommended to keep yourself and others free from illness. See How to Protect Yourself.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this interim guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available.
This interim guidance is to help household members plan for community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages household members to prepare for the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak in their community.
COVID-19 is caused by a new virus. There is much to learn about its transmissibility, severity, and other features of the disease. We want to help everyone prepare to respond to this public health threat.
Before a COVID-19 outbreak occurs: Plan
During a COVID-19 outbreak: Act
After a COVID-19 outbreak has ended: Follow Up
Before a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community: Plan
A COVID-19 outbreak could last for a long time in your community. Depending on the severity of the outbreak, public health officials may recommend community actions designed to help keep people healthy, reduce exposures to COVID-19, and slow the spread of the disease. Local public health officials may make recommendations appropriate to your local situation. Creating a household plan can help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community. You should base the details of your household plan on the needs and daily routine of your household members.
Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan. Meet with household members, other relatives, and friends to discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community and what the needs of each person will be.
Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications. There is limited information about who may be at risk for severe complications from COVID-19 illness. From the data that are available for COVID-19 patients, and from data for related coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is possible that older adults and persons who have underlying chronic medical conditions may be at risk for more serious complications. Early data suggest older people are more likely to have serious COVID-19 illness. If you or your household members are at increased risk for COVID-19 complications, please consult with your health care provider for more information about monitoring your health for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. CDC will recommend actions to help keep people at high risk for complications healthy if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community.
Get to know your neighbors. Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning. If your neighborhood has a website or social media page, consider joining it to maintain access to neighbors, information, and resources.
Identify aid organizations in your community. Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, health care services, support, and resources. Consider including organizations that provide mental health or counseling services, food, and other supplies.
Create an emergency contact list. Ensure your household has a current list of emergency contacts for family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other community resources.
Practice good personal health habits and plan for home-based actions
Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent and water prior to disinfection. For disinfection, a list of products with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved emerging viral pathogens claims, maintained by the American Chemistry Council Center for Biocide Chemistries (CBC), is available at Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Fighting Products
. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Always wash your hands with soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.
Choose a room in your home that can be used to separate sick household members from those who are healthy. Identify a separate bathroom for the sick person to use, if possible. Plan to clean these rooms, as needed, when someone is sick. Learn how to care for someone with COVID-19 at home.
Learn about the emergency operations plan at your child’s school or childcare facility. During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, local public health officials may recommend temporary school dismissals to help slow the spread of illness. School authorities also may decide to dismiss a school if too many students or staff are absent. Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the school’s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Learn about your employer’s emergency operations plan. Discuss sick-leave policies and telework options for workers who are sick or who need to stay home to care for sick household members. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community: Act
During an outbreak in your community, protect yourself and others by:
Staying home from work, school, and all activities when you are sick with COVID-19 symptoms, which may include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Get up-to-date information about local COVID-19 activity from public health officials
Stay home if you are sick. Stay home if you have COVID-19 symptoms. If a member of your household is sick, stay home from school and work to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others.
If your children are in the care of others, urge caregivers to watch for COVID-19 symptoms.
Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.
Use the separate room and bathroom you prepared for sick household members (if possible). Learn how to care for someone with COVID-19 at home. Avoid sharing personal items like food and drinks. Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others. Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent and water prior to disinfection. For disinfection, a list of products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims, maintained by the CBC, is available at Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Fighting Products
. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.
Stay in touch with others by phone or email. If you live alone and become sick during a COVID-19 outbreak, you may need help. If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends with chronic medical conditions.
Take care of the emotional health of your household members. Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your schedule changes. Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily.
Take the following steps to help protect your children during an outbreak
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
After a COVID-19 outbreak has ended in your community: Follow Up
Remember, a COVID-19 outbreak could last a long time. The impact on individuals, households, and communities might be great. When public health officials determine the outbreak has ended in your community, take time to improve your household’s plan. As public health officials continue to plan for COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks, you and your household also have an important role to play in ongoing planning efforts.
Discuss and note lessons learned. Were your COVID-19 preparedness actions effective at home, school, and work? Talk about problems found in your plan and effective solutions. Identify additional resources needed for you and your household.
Participate in community discussions about emergency planning. Let others know about what readiness actions worked for you and your household. Maintain communication lines with your community (e.g., social media and email lists). Promote the importance of practicing good personal health habits.
Take care of the emotional health of your household members. Make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade. Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories about COVID-19. Connect with family and friends. Share your concerns and how you are feeling with others.
Help your child/children cope after the outbreak. Provide children with opportunities to talk about what they went through or what they think about it. Encourage them to share concerns and ask questions. Because parents, teachers, and other adults see children in different situations, it is important for them to work together to share information about how each child is coping after the outbreak.

Tips to keep children healthy while school’s out
Talking to Children About COVID-19
Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on Are you at higher risk for severe illness.
Clean hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer
Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets, sinks)
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities. Additional information on how COVID-19 is spread is available at How COVID-19 Spreads.
Children may present with mild symptoms
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is more to learn about how the disease impacts children.
No. If your child is healthy, there is no need for them to wear a facemask. Only people who have symptoms of illness or who are providing care to those who are ill should wear masks.
Limit Social Interactions: The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit contact as much as possible. While school is out, children should not have playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.
Practice Social Distancing: If you have small meetups, consider hanging out with another family or friend who is also taking extra measures to put distance between themselves and others (social distancing).
Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may only have mild symptoms. However, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions.
Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity.
Keep children healthy
If you see any sign of illness consistent with symptoms of COVID-19, particularly fever, cough, or shortness of breath, call your healthcare provider and keep your child at home and away from others as much as possible. Follow CDC’s guidance on “What to do if you are sick.”
Some common changes to watch for include excessive worry or sadness, unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, and difficulty with attention and concentration. For more information, see the “For Parents” section on CDC’s website, Manage Anxiety and Stress.
Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand.
Go to CDC’s Helping Children Cope with Emergencies or Talking with Children About COVID-19 for more information.
Parents and caretakers play an important role in teaching children to wash their hands. Explain that hand washing can keep them healthy and stop the virus from spreading to others.
Encourage your child to play outdoors—it’s great for physical and mental health. Take a walk with your child or go on a bike ride.
Use indoor activity breaks (e.g., stretch breaks, dance breaks) throughout the day to help your child stay healthy and focused.
Limit time with older adults, relatives, and people with serious underlying medical conditions
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
If others in your home are at particularly high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider extra precautions to separate your child from those people.
If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals, carefully consider who might be best positioned to provide child care. If someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult, such as a grandparent or someone with a chronic medical condition), limit your children’s contact with other people.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in certain types of animals.
Coronaviruses that infect animals can become able to infect people, but this is rare.
We do not know the exact source of the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
We do not have evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19.
We do not have evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products imported pose a risk for spreading the 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. CDC regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health; USDA regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and FWS regulates importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources.
Some coronaviruses that infect animals have become able to infect humans and then spread between people, but this is rare. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are examples of diseases caused by coronaviruses that originated in animals and spread to people. This is what is suspected to have happened with the virus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19. However, we do not know the exact source of this virus. Public health officials and partners are working hard to identify the source of COVID-19. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person to person. The coronavirus most similar to the virus causing COVID-19 is the one that causes SARS.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19 or that they might be a source of infection in the United States.
CDC does not have evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
How to stay healthy around animals
In the United States, there is no evidence to suggest that any animals, including pets, livestock, or wildlife, might be a source of COVID-19 infection at this time. However, because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals.
Take pets to the veterinarian regularly and talk to your veterinarian if you have questions about your pet’s health.
For more information, visit CDC’s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
CDC has not received any reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.
If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed), you should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. This can help ensure both you and your animals stay healthy.

Children and teens react, in part, on what they see from the adults around them. When parents and caregivers deal with the COVID-19 calmly and confidently, they can provide the best support for their children. Parents can be more reassuring to others around them, especially children, if they are better prepared.
Unhealthy eating or sleeping habits
Use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs
Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand.
Responding to COVID-19 can take an emotional toll on you. There are things you can do to reduce secondary traumatic stress (STS) reactions:
Learn the symptoms including physical (fatigue, illness) and mental (fear, withdrawal, guilt).
Allow time for you and your family to recover from responding to the pandemic.
Take a break from media coverage of COVID-19.
Ask for help if you feel overwhelmed or concerned that COVID-19 is affecting your ability to care for your family and patients as you did before the outbreak.
Learn more tips for taking care of yourself during emergency response.
Being separated from others if a healthcare provider thinks you may have been exposed to COVID-19 can be stressful, even if you do not get sick. Everyone feels differently after coming out of quarantine. Some feelings include :
Fear and worry about your own health and the health of your loved ones
Stress from the experience of monitoring yourself or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of COVID-19
Sadness, anger, or frustration because friends or loved ones have unfounded fears of contracting the disease from contact with you, even though you have been determined not to be contagious

COVID-19 FAQs
Public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are stressful times for people and communities. Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to social stigma (1) toward people, places, or things. For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population or nationality, even though not everyone in that population or from that region is specifically at risk for the disease. Stigma can also occur after a person has been released from COVID-19 quarantine even though they are not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others.
It is important to remember that people – including those of Asian descent – who do not live in or have not recently been in an area of ongoing spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, or have not been in contact with a person who is a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 are not at greater risk of spreading COVID-19 than other Americans.
Some groups of people who may be experiencing stigma because of COVID-19 include:
Emergency responders or healthcare professionals
Denials of healthcare, education, housing or employment
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health (2) of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient (3). See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
Communicators and public health officials can help counter stigma during the COVID-19 response.
Maintain privacy and confidentiality of those seeking healthcare and those who may be part of any contact investigation.
Raise awareness about COVID-19 without increasing fear.
Share accurate information about how the virus spreads.
Thank healthcare workers and responders. People who have traveled to areas where the COVID-19 outbreak is happening to help have performed a valuable service to everyone by helping make sure this disease does not spread further.
Stigma occurs when people associate a risk with a specific people, place, or thing – like a minority population group – and there is no evidence that the risk is greater in that group than in the general population. Stigmatization is especially common in disease outbreaks. (https://emergency.cdc.gov/cerc/cerccorner/article_123016.asp)
Mental health is defined by the World Health Organization as a state of well being in which a person realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response
Resilience is the ability to withstand and recover from stress. (https://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2017/08/predicting-community-resilience-and-recovery-after-a-disaster/)

Talking with children about Coronavirus Disease 2019
As public conversations around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increase, children may worry about themselves, their family, and friends getting ill with COVID-19. Parents, family members, school staff, and other trusted adults can play an important role in helping children make sense of what they hear in a way that is honest, accurate, and minimizes anxiety or fear. CDC has created guidance to help adults have conversations with children about COVID-19 and ways they can avoid getting and spreading the disease.
Remember that viruses can make anyone sick, regardless of a person’s race or ethnicity. Avoid making assumptions about who might have COVID-19.
Consider reducing the amount of screen time focused on COVID-19. Too much information on one topic can lead to anxiety.
Talk to children about how some stories on COVID-19 on the Internet and social media may be based on rumors and inaccurate information.
If soap and water are not available, teach them to use hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol. Supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol, especially in schools and child care facilities.
Facts about COVID-19 for discussions with children
Try to keep information simple and remind them that health and school officials are working hard to keep everyone safe and healthy.
What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is the short name for “coronavirus disease 2019.” It is a new virus. Doctors and scientists are still learning about it.
Recently, this virus has made a lot of people sick. Scientists and doctors think that most people will be ok, especially kids, but some people might get pretty sick.
Doctors and health experts are working hard to help people stay healthy.
What can I do so that I don’t get COVID-19?
You can practice healthy habits at home, school, and play to help protect against the spread of COVID-19:
Keep things clean. Older children can help adults at home and school clean the things we touch the most, like desks, doorknobs, light switches, and remote controls. (Note for adults: you can find more information about cleaning and disinfecting on CDC’s website.)
What happens if you get sick with COVID-19?
COVID-19 can look different in different people. For many people, being sick with COVID-19 would be a little bit like having the flu. People can get a fever, cough, or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID-19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems. From what doctors have seen so far, most children don’t seem to get very sick. While a lot of adults get sick, most adults get better.
If you do get sick, it doesn’t mean you have COVID-19. People can get sick from all kinds of germs. What’s important to remember is that if you do get sick, the adults at home and school will help get you any help that you need.
If you suspect your child may have COVID-19, call the healthcare facility to let them know before you bring your child in to see them.

Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This interim guidance is for staff at local and state health departments, infection prevention and control professionals, and healthcare personnel who are coordinating the home care and isolation1 of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, including persons under investigation (see Criteria to Guide Evaluation of Persons Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19). This includes patients evaluated in an outpatient setting who do not require hospitalization (i.e., patients who are medically stable and can receive care at home) or patients who are discharged home following a hospitalization with confirmed COVID-19 infection.
In general, people should adhere to home isolation until the risk of secondary transmission is thought to be low. Visit the Preventing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Homes and Residential Communities page for more information.
Preventing 2COVID-19 from Spreading in Homes and Communities: Interim guidance that may help prevent COVID-19 from spreading among people in homes and in communities.
This document does not apply to patients in healthcare settings. For interim healthcare infection prevention and control recommendations, see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Known or Persons Under Investigation forCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting. CDC will update this interim guidance as needed and as more information becomes available.
In consultation with state or local health department staff, a healthcare professional should assess whether the residential setting is appropriate for home care. Considerations for care at home include whether:
The patient and other household members have access to appropriate, recommended personal protective equipment (at a minimum, gloves and facemask) and are capable of adhering to precautions recommended as part of home care or isolation (e.g., respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, hand hygiene);
There are household members who may be at increased risk of complications from COVID-19 infection (.e.g., people >65 years old, young children, pregnant women, people who are immunocompromised or who have chronic heart, lung, or kidney conditions).
A healthcare professional should
Provide CDC’s Interim Guidance for Preventing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Spreading to Others in Homes and Communities to the patient, caregiver, and household members; and
Contact their state or local health department to discuss criteria for discontinuing any such measures. Check available hours when contacting local health departments.
1Isolation is defined as the separation or restriction of activities of an ill person with a contagious disease from those who are well.

Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response
Release of Stockpiled N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators Beyond the Manufacturer-Designated Shelf Life: Considerations for the COVID-19 Response
Audience: These considerations are intended for use by federal, state, and local public health officials, respiratory protection program managers, occupational health service leaders, infection prevention and control program leaders, and other leaders in healthcare settings who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing pathogen transmission in healthcare settings.
Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called “N95 respirators”) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities:  Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.
The following strategies are based upon these assumptions:  1) facilities understand their current N95 respirator inventory and supply chain, 2) facilities understand their N95 respirators utilization rate, and 3) facilities are in communication with state and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) and healthcare coalitions. While these strategies are targeted for optimizing the supply of N95 respirators, some of these strategies may be applicable to optimizing the supply of other personal protective equipment such as gowns, gloves, and eye protection.
To prevent infectious disease transmission, elimination (physically removing the hazard) and substitution (replacing the hazard) are not typically options for the healthcare setting. However, exposures to transmissible respiratory pathogens in healthcare facilities can often be reduced or possibly avoided through engineering and administrative controls and PPE. Prompt detection and effective triage and isolation of potentially infectious patients are essential to prevent unnecessary exposures among patients, healthcare personnel (HCP), and visitors at the facility.
N95 respirators are the PPE most often used to control exposures to infections transmitted via the airborne route, though their effectiveness is highly dependent upon proper fit and use. The optimal way to prevent airborne transmission is to use a combination of interventions from across the hierarchy of controls, not just PPE alone. Applying a combination of controls can provide an additional degree of protection, even if one intervention fails or is not available.
Respirators, when required to protect HCP from airborne contaminants such as infectious agents, must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that meets the requirements of OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard
. The program should include medical evaluations, training, and fit testing.
Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 response. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve N95 respirator supplies along the continuum of care.1
Conventional capacity: measures consist of providing patient care without any change in daily contemporary practices. This set of measures, consisting of engineering, administrative, and PPE controls should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings.
Consultation with entities that include some combination of: local healthcare coalitions, federal, state, or local public health officials, appropriate state agencies that are managing the overall emergency response related to COVID-19, and state crisis standards of care committees. Even when state/local coalitions or public health authorities can shift resources between health care facilities, these strategies may still be necessary.

Burden of Disease and Risk Factors
Clinical Course and Complications
Burden of COVID-19 and epidemiologic risk factors in children
Relatively few cases of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported in children compared with the total number of cases in the general population. As of Feb. 20, 2020, 2.4% of the 75,465 cases (confirmed and suspected) in China had occurred among persons younger than 19 years old. An analysis from one large city in southern China suggests that, among all cases, the proportion of children younger than 15 years old may have increased from 2% to 13% from early to later in the outbreak.
Of the cases reported in China to date, most children had exposure to household members with confirmed COVID-19. In one case, a three-month-old child visited a healthcare setting before COVID-19 was confirmed and was thought to be the first case in a family cluster—the source of infection (healthcare or community) was not determined. At least one child who primarily had gastrointestinal symptoms sought care at multiple outpatient healthcare centers before becoming a confirmed case.
During previous outbreaks caused by related zoonotic beta coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the majority of confirmed cases occurred among adults. During the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, less than 5% of cases were diagnosed in patients younger than 18. The majority of SARS cases in patients younger than 18 were thought to have occurred through household transmission, though some cases were hospital-acquired. The majority of MERS-CoV cases in children were also thought to be due to household transmission.
Children may play a role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. In one report examining 10 infected children in China, SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) was detected in respiratory specimens up to 22 days after symptoms began and in stool up to 30 days after symptoms began. A case report of a 6-month-old infant describes detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood, stool, and multiple nasopharyngeal swab samples, even though the infant’s only documented manifestation of illness was one recorded temperature of 38.5° C (101.3° F). Viral culture was not performed on specimens in these reports; therefore, it is uncertain whether persistent or asymptomatic RNA detection represented potentially transmissible virus.
Currently, it is unknown if differences in reported incidence of confirmed COVID-19 among children versus adults in China is because of difference in exposures (e.g., children are less likely to care for sick contacts), disease severity, testing, or surveillance (e.g., symptoms at presentation differ from case definitions for surveillance or diagnosis).
Symptoms in Pediatric Patients
symptoms of respiratory infection
The predominant signs and symptoms of COVID-19 reported to date among all patients are similar to other viral respiratory infections. These include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, were reported in a minority of adult patients.
In a report of nine hospitalized infants in China with confirmed COVID-19, only half presented with fever. At least one child to date had primarily gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia at initial presentation. There have been multiple reports to date of children with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Data from pediatric cases of SARS and MERS also show milder symptoms among children compared with adults, and adolescents with SARS had more severe symptoms compared with younger children. Co-detection of other respiratory pathogens (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) have been described in children with COVID-19.
Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children may be similar to those for common viral respiratory infections or other childhood illnesses. It is important for pediatric providers to have an appropriate suspicion of COVID-19, but also to continue to consider and test for other diagnoses, such as influenza (see CDC’s Flu Information for Healthcare Professionals for more information).
Clinical course and complications in children
Complications of COVID-19 appear to be milder among children compared with adults based on limited reports from China. Severe complications (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock) were reported in one case of a 13-month old with confirmed COVID-19. Other reports describe a mild disease course, including in infants. As of February 20, 2020, just one of the 2,114 deaths among 55,924 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China occurred among children younger than 20 years old. No further details were provided about this patient.
Chest X-rays of children with COVID-19 show patchy infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonia, and chest CT scans have shown nodular ground glass opacities.
During the 2003-2004 SARS outbreak, patients younger than 12 years old had milder and shorter illnesses than adults, and no deaths were reported. Death was rare among children with MERS. One pediatric death from MERS was reported in a child with cystic fibrosis who had respiratory specimens also positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas.
Though symptoms and disease course for COVID-19 may be milder in children than adults, it is unknown if children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of severe disease.
Currently, there are no antiviral drugs recommended or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for COVID-19. Clinical management includes promptly using recommended infection prevention and control measures (e.g., a respirator or facemask, gloves, gown, eye protection) in healthcare settings and supportive management of complications.
Lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-alpha have been used for treatment of children with COVID-19 in China but safety and efficacy of these drugs have not been determined. Remdesivir is an investigational antiviral drug that has been reported to have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Some adult patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir through clinical trials or compassionate use, although remdesivir has not been used for treatment of children with COVID-19. For additional information on investigational therapeutics, please see Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).

Checklist for Healthcare Facilities
Based on the current COVID-19 situation and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), CDC has specific recommendations, summarized below. As we learn more about COVID-19 and as the needs of the response or availability of PPE within U.S. healthcare facilities changes, we will update our guidance.
Patients with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection should wear a facemask when being evaluated medically.
Healthcare personnel should adhere to Standard and Transmission-based Precautions when caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recommended PPE is described in the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
Cases of COVID-19 are being reported in China as well as other countries. Given decreases in exports from select countries (e.g., China, India, Taiwan) and increases in demand due to the outbreak, manufacturers of select types of PPE are reporting increased volume of orders and challenges in meeting order demands. Plans to surge manufacturing globally are underway.
Emergency Use Authorization of Respiratory Protective Devices:
On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary declared that circumstances exist to justify the authorization of emergency use of additional respiratory protective devices in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 outbreak. Manufacturers, facilities, and local/state jurisdictions with respirators held in stockpile can submit a request to FDA in order to have their products added to the Emergency Use Authorization. Healthcare personnel can access a list of authorized respirators in Appendix B.
 More information can be found on FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization website

Interim Infection Prevention and Control Guidance for Dental Settings During the COVID-19 Response
Postpone elective procedures, surgeries, and non-urgent dental visits, and contact patients prior to emergency procedures. Stay at home if sick and know steps to take if a patient with COVID-19 symptoms enters your facility.
  The following dental-specific recommendations should be used with CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for patients with COVID-19. This information supplements, but does not replace, the general infection prevention and control (IPC) recommendations for COVID-19.
The practice of dentistry involves the use of rotary dental and surgical instruments (e.g., handpieces or ultrasonic scalers) and air-water syringes. These instruments create a visible spray that contains large particle droplets of water, saliva, blood, microorganisms, and other debris. This spatter travels only a short distance and settles out quickly, landing on the floor, nearby operatory surfaces, dental health care personnel (DHCP1), or the patient. The spray also might contain certain aerosols.
Caring for patients requiring Transmission-Based Precautions is not possible in most dental settings as they are not designed for or equipped to provide this standard of care. For example, most dental settings do not have airborne infection isolation rooms or single-patient rooms, do not have a respiratory protection program, and do not routinely stock N95 respirators.
Services should be limited to urgent and emergency visits only during this period of the pandemic. These actions help staff and patients stay safe, preserve personal protective equipment and patient care supplies, and expand available health system capacity.
Implement sick leave policies for DHCP that are flexible, non-punitive, and consistent with public health guidance (e.g., allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection). Ask staff to stay home if they are sick and send staff home if they develop symptoms while at work.
  Contact Patients Prior to Clinically Urgent/Emergency2 Dental Treatment
Call all patients before their scheduled appointments and screen for symptoms of respiratory illness over the phone (e.g., fever3, cough, shortness of breath). If the patient reports signs or symptoms of fever or respiratory illness, DHCP and medical providers should work together to determine the appropriate facility for emergency treatment.
  People with COVID-19 who have completed home isolation clearance can receive emergency dental care. This is defined as:
At least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms, e.g., cough, shortness of breath), and at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first occurred.
For individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have not had any symptoms, at least 7 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test and have had no subsequent illness
  Know Actions to Take if a Patient Has Suspected/Confirmed COVID-19
If a patient at your facility is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, take the following actions:
Refer the patient to a medical facility if acutely sick (e.g., trouble breathing)
Clean and disinfect the room and equipment according to the Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health-Care Settings—2003
Clean, disinfect, or discard the surface, supplies, or equipment located within 6 feet of symptomatic patients
on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program from use against SARS-CoV-2

Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of Isolation Gowns
Audience: These considerations are intended for use by federal, state, and local public health officials; leaders in occupational health services and infection prevention and control programs; and other leaders in healthcare settings who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing pathogen transmission in healthcare settings.
Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of isolation gowns in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness plans.
Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no widely accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of isolation gowns during the COVID-19 response. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve isolation gown supplies along the continuum of care.
Conventional capacity: measures consist of providing patient care without any change in daily contemporary practices. This set of measures, consisting of engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment (PPE) controls should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings.
Contingency capacity: measures may change daily standard practices but may not have any significant impact on the care delivered to the patient or the safety of healthcare personnel (HCP). These practices may be used temporarily during periods of expected isolation gown shortages.
Crisis capacity: strategies that are not commensurate with standard U.S. standards of care. These measures, or a combination of these measures, may need to be considered during periods of known isolation gown shortages.
Facilities understand their current isolation gown inventory and supply chain
Facilities understand their isolation gown utilization rate
Facilities are in communication with local healthcare coalitions, federal, state, and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) regarding identification of additional supplies
Reducing the number of patients going to the hospital or outpatient settings
Excluding visitors to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19
Use isolation gown alternatives that offer equivalent or higher protection.
Several fluid-resistant and impermeable protective clothing options are available in the marketplace for HCP. These include isolation gowns and surgical gowns. When selecting the most appropriate protective clothing, employers should consider all of the available information on recommended protective clothing, including the potential limitations. Nonsterile, disposable patient isolation gowns, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for use by HCP when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In times of gown shortages, surgical gowns should be prioritized for surgical and other sterile procedures. Current U.S. guidelines do not require use of gowns that conform to any standards.
Shift gown use towards cloth isolation gowns.
specifies the minimum design, performance, testing, documentation, and certification requirements for new single-use and new multiple-use emergency medical operations protective clothing, including coveralls for HCP.
The majority of isolation gowns do not have a manufacturer-designated shelf life. However, consideration can be made to using gowns that do and are past their manufacturer-designated shelf life. If there is no date available on the gown label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer.
Current guidelines do not require use of gowns that conform to any standards. In times of shortages, healthcare facilities can consider using international gowns and coveralls. Gowns and coveralls that conform to international standards, including with EN 13795 and EN14126, could be reserved for activities that may involve moderate to high amounts of body fluids.
Extended use of isolation gowns.
Consideration can be made to extend the use of isolation gowns (disposable or cloth) such that the same gown is worn by the same HCP when interacting with more than one patient known to be infected with the same infectious disease when these patients housed in the same location (i.e., COVID-19 patients residing in an isolation cohort). This can be considered only if there are no additional co-infectious diagnoses transmitted by contact (such as Clostridioides difficile) among patients. If the gown becomes visibly soiled, it must be removed and discarded as per usual practices
Re-use of cloth isolation gowns.
Disposable gowns are not typically amenable to being doffed and re-used because the ties and fasteners typically break during doffing. Cloth isolation gowns could potentially be untied and retied and could be considered for re-use without laundering in between.
In a situation where the gown is being used as part of standard precautions to protect HCP from a splash, the risk of re-using a non-visibly soiled cloth isolation gown may be lower. However, for care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, HCP risk from re-use of cloth isolation gowns without laundering among (1) single HCP caring for multiple patients using one gown or (2) among multiple HCP sharing one gown is unclear. The goal of this strategy is to minimize exposures to HCP and not necessarily prevent transmission between patients. Any gown that becomes visibly soiled during patient care should be disposed of and cleaned.
During the following high-contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of healthcare providers, such as:
In situation of severely limited or no available isolation gowns, the following pieces of clothing can be considered as a last resort for care of COVID-19 patients as single use. However, none of these options can be considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Preferable features include long sleeves and closures (snaps, buttons) that can be fastened and secured.
Combinations of clothing: Combinations of pieces of clothing can be considered for activities that may involve body fluids and when there are no gowns available:

Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of facemasks in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness plans.
Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of facemasks during the COVID-19 response. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve facemask supplies along the continuum of care.
Conventional capacity: measures consist of providing patient care without any change in daily contemporary practices. This set of measures, consisting of engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment (PPE) controls should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings.
Contingency capacity: measures may change daily standard practices but may not have any significant impact on the care delivered to the patient or the safety of healthcare personnel (HCP). These practices may be used temporarily during periods of expected facemask shortages.
Facilities are in communication with local healthcare coalitions, federal, state, and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) regarding identification of additional supplies.
Reducing the number of patients going to the hospital or outpatient settings
Excluding visitors to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19
Facemasks that are not regulated by FDA, such as some procedure masks, which are typically used for isolation purposes, may not provide protection against splashes and sprays.
Healthcare facilities can consider removing all facemasks from public areas. Facemasks can be available to provide to symptomatic patients upon check in at entry points. All facemasks should be placed in a secure and monitored site. This is especially important in high-traffic areas like emergency departments.
Have patients with symptoms of respiratory infection use tissues or other barriers to cover their mouth and nose.
Limited re-use of facemasks is the practice of using the same facemask by one HCP for multiple encounters with different patients but removing it after each encounter. As it is unknown what the potential contribution of contact transmission is for SARS-CoV-2, care should be taken to ensure that HCP do not touch outer surfaces of the mask during care, and that mask removal and replacement be done in a careful and deliberate manner.
Exclude HCP at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 from contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
During severe resource limitations, consider excluding HCP who may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Designate convalescent HCP for provision of care to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
It may be possible to designate HCP who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 to preferentially provide care for additional patients with COVID-19. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection may have developed some protective immunity, but this has not yet been confirmed.
Consider use of expedient patient isolation rooms for risk reduction.
Portable fan devices with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration that are carefully placed can increase the effective air changes per hour of clean air to the patient room, reducing risk to individuals entering the room without respiratory protection. NIOSH has developed guidance for using portable HEPA filtration systems to create expedient patient isolation rooms. The expedient patient isolation room approach involves establishing a high-ventilation-rate, negative pressure, inner isolation zone that sits within a “clean” larger ventilated zone.
NIOSH has developed the ventilated headboard that draws exhaled air from a patient in bed into a HEPA filter, decreasing risk of HCP exposure to patient-generated aerosol. This technology consists of lightweight, sturdy, and adjustable aluminum framing with a retractable plastic canopy. The ventilated headboard can be deployed in combination with HEPA fan/filter units to provide surge isolation capacity within a variety of environments, from traditional patient rooms to triage stations, and emergency medical shelters.
In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.

During a large-scale public health emergency involving a respiratory disease like COVID-19, federal, state, or local stockpiled ventilators should be deployed in a way that optimizes the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of this scarce resource. Decisions on the allocation of stockpiled ventilators to facilities should be based on multiple factors, including:1
State and local planners can use the strategies in this guide to assist them when allocating ventilators from public health stockpiles to hospitals and other facilities during a pandemic.
Number of hospitalizations
Percentage of hospitalizations with critical illness requiring critical care
Determine the population size that each hospital serves and assess the capacity of each facility to serve vulnerable and high-risk populations within this area.
Consider whether each hospital serves as a referral hospital/regional hospital or serves a high-density population area, rural area, or underserved populations.
Does the allocation plan apply criteria consistently across all hospitals/facilities in the jurisdiction?

Similarly, non-healthcare facilities (e.g., correctional facilities) may find this tool useful for planning and optimizing PPE use as part of the response to COVID-19. This tool can also be used for planning PPE use outside the context of COVID-19, where PPE shortages may also occur due to supply chain issues related to the COVID-19 response (e.g. manufacturing facilities).

Reducing the number of patients going to the hospital or outpatient settings
Excluding visitors to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19
Ensure appropriate cleaning and disinfection between users if goggles or reusable face shields are used.
If a disposable face shield is reprocessed, it should be dedicated to one HCP and reprocessed whenever it is visibly soiled or removed (e.g., when leaving the isolation area) prior to putting it back on. See protocol for removing and reprocessing eye protection below.
Exclude HCP at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 from contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
During severe resource limitations, consider excluding HCP who may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Designate convalescent HCP for provision of care to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
It may be possible to designate HCP who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 to preferentially provide care for additional patients with COVID-19. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection may have developed some protective immunity, but this has not yet been confirmed.
Adhere to recommended manufacturer instructions for cleaning and disinfection.
When manufacturer instructions for cleaning and disinfection are unavailable, such as for single use disposable face shields, consider:
Carefully wipe the outside of the face shield or goggles using a wipe or clean cloth saturated with EPA-registered hospital disinfectant solution.
Wipe the outside of face shield or goggles with clean water or alcohol to remove residue.

Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Patients
There are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.  At present clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care, including supplementary oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated.  An array of drugs approved for other indications as well as several investigational drugs are being studied in several hundred clinical trials that are underway across the globe. The purpose of this document is to provide information on two of the approved drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and one of the investigational agents (remdesivir) currently in use in the United States.
Remdesivir is an investigational intravenous drug with broad antiviral activity that inhibits viral replication through premature termination of RNA transcription and has in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and in-vitro and in-vivo activity against related betacoronaviruses [1-3].
There are currently four options for obtaining remdesivir for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia in the United States:
A National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored adaptive double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of remdesivir versus placebo in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and hypoxia is enrolling non-pregnant persons aged 18 years and older with oxygen saturation of ≤94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705
). Exclusion criteria include alanine aminotransaminase or aspartate aminotransaminase levels >5 times the upper limit of normal, stage 4 severe chronic kidney disease or a requirement for dialysis (i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30);
Two phase 3 randomized open-label trials of remdesivir (5-days versus 10-days versus standard of care) are open to enrollment in persons aged 18 years and older with COVID-19, radiographic evidence of pneumonia and oxygen saturation of ≤94% on room air (severe disease https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292899
) or >94% on room air (moderate disease https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292730
). Exclusion criteria include alanine aminotransaminase or aspartate aminotransaminase levels >5 times the upper limit of normal, participation in another clinical trial of an experimental treatment for COVID-19, requirement for mechanical ventilation, or creatinine clearance <50 mL/min; and
Finally, in areas without clinical trials, COVID-19 patients in the United States and other countries have been treated with remdesivir on an uncontrolled compassionate use basis. The manufacturer is currently transitioning the provision of emergency access to remdesivir from individual compassionate use requests to an expanded access program.  The expanded access program for the United States is under rapid development. Further information is available at: https://rdvcu.gilead.com/
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are oral prescription drugs that have been used for treatment of malaria and certain inflammatory conditions. Chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and chemoprophylaxis, and hydroxychloroquine is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyria cutanea tarda. Both drugs have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, with hydroxychloroquine having relatively higher potency against SARS-CoV-2 [1,4,5]. A study in China reported that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group, and chloroquine was added as a recommended antiviral for treatment of COVID-19 in China [6]. Based upon limited in-vitro and anecdotal data, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are currently recommended for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in several countries. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have known safety profiles with the main concerns being cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT syndrome) with prolonged use in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and immunosuppression but have been reportedly well-tolerated in COVID-19 patients.
Due to higher in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its wider availability in the United States compared with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine has been administered to hospitalized COVID-19 patients on an uncontrolled basis in multiple countries, including in the United States. One small study reported that hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin reduced detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens compared with a non-randomized control group but did not assess clinical benefit [7]. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are associated with QT prolongation and caution is advised when considering these drugs in patients with chronic medical conditions (e.g. renal failure, hepatic disease) or who are receiving medications that might interact to cause arrythmias.
Hydroxychloroquine is currently under investigation in clinical trials for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and treatment of patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. In the United States, several clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection are planned or will be enrolling soon.  More information on trials can be found at:  https://clinicaltrials.gov/
There are no currently available data from Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) to inform clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Although optimal dosing and duration of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 are unknown, some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotally different hydroxychloroquine dosing such as: 400mg BID on day one, then daily for 5 days; 400 mg BID on day one, then 200mg BID for 4 days; 600 mg BID on day one, then 400mg daily on days 2-5.
Lopinavir-ritonavir did not show promise for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia in a recent clinical trial in China [8].  This trial was underpowered, and lopinavir-ritonavir is under investigation in a World Health Organization study.
Several other drugs are under investigation in clinical trials or are being considered for clinical trials of prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 in the United States and worldwide. Information on registered clinical trials for COVID-19 in the United States is available at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/

Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings
Prehospital Considerations
During Hospitalization
These infection prevention and control considerations are for healthcare facilities providing obstetric care for pregnant patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or pregnant persons under investigation (PUI) in inpatient obstetric healthcare settings including obstetrical triage, labor and delivery, recovery and inpatient postpartum settings.
This information is intended to aid hospitals and clinicians in applying broader CDC interim guidance on infection control (Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings).
Since maternity and newborn care units vary in physical configuration, each facility should consider their appropriate space and staffing needs to prevent transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. These considerations include appropriate isolation of pregnant patients who have confirmed COVID-19 or are PUIs; basic and refresher training for all healthcare personnel on those units to include correct adherence to infection control practices and personal protective equipment (PPE) use and handling; sufficient and appropriate PPE supplies positioned at all points of care; and processes to protect newborns from risk of COVID-19.
These considerations are based upon the limited evidence available to date about transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19, and knowledge of other viruses that cause severe respiratory illness including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The approaches outlined below are intentionally cautious until additional data become available to refine recommendations for prevention of person-to-person transmission in inpatient obstetric care settings.
Prehospital Considerations
Pregnant patients who have confirmed COVID-19 or who are PUIs should notify the obstetric unit prior to arrival so the facility can make appropriate infection control preparations (e.g., identifying the most appropriate room for labor and delivery, ensuring infection prevention and control supplies and PPE are correctly positioned, informing all healthcare personnel who will be involved in the patient’s care of infection control expectations) before the patient’s arrival.
If a pregnant patient who has confirmed COVID-19 or is a PUI is arriving via transport by emergency medical services, the driver should contact the receiving emergency department or healthcare facility and follow previously agreed-upon local or regional transport protocols. For more information refer to the Interim Guidance for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems and 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for COVID-19 in the United States.
Healthcare providers should promptly notify infection control personnel at their facility of the anticipated arrival of a pregnant patient who has confirmed COVID-19 or is a PUI.
During Hospitalization
Healthcare facilities should ensure recommended infection control practices for hospitalized pregnant patients who have confirmed COVID-19 or are PUIs are consistent with Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
All healthcare facilities that provide obstetric care must ensure that their personnel are correctly trained and capable of implementing recommended infection control interventions. Individual healthcare personnel should ensure they understand and can adhere to infection control requirements.
Healthcare facilities should follow the above infection control guidance on managing visitor access, including essential support persons for women in labor (e.g., spouse, partner).
Infants born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19 should be considered PUIs. As such, infants should be isolated according to the Infection Prevention and Control Guidance for PUIs.
It is unknown whether newborns with COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe complications. Transmission after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is a concern. To reduce the risk of  transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 from the mother to the newborn, facilities should consider temporarily separating (e.g., separate rooms) the mother who has confirmed COVID-19 or is a PUI from her baby until the mother’s transmission-based precautions are discontinued, as described in the Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19. See the considerations below for temporary separation:
The risks and benefits of temporary separation of the mother from her baby should be discussed with the mother by the healthcare team.
A separate isolation room should be available for the infant while they remain a PUI. Healthcare facilities should consider limiting visitors, with the exception of a healthy parent or caregiver. Visitors should be instructed to wear appropriate PPE, including gown, gloves, face mask, and eye protection. If another healthy family or staff member is present to provide care (e.g., diapering, bathing) and feeding for the newborn, they should use appropriate PPE. For healthy family members, appropriate PPE includes gown, gloves, face mask, and eye protection. For healthcare personnel, recommendations for appropriate PPE are outlined in the Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations.
The decision to discontinue temporary separation of the mother from her baby should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health officials. The decision should take into account disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Considerations to discontinue temporary separation are the same as those to discontinue transmission-based precautions for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Please see Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19.
If colocation (sometimes referred to as “rooming in”) of the newborn with his/her ill mother in the same hospital room occurs in accordance with the mother’s wishes or is unavoidable due to facility limitations, facilities should consider implementing measures to reduce exposure of the newborn to the virus that causes COVID-19.
If no other healthy adult is present in the room to care for the newborn, a mother who has confirmed COVID-19 or is a PUI should put on a facemask and practice hand hygiene1 before each feeding or other close contact with her newborn. The facemask should remain in place during contact with the newborn. These practices should continue while the mother is on transmission-based precautions in a healthcare facility.
During temporary separation, mothers who intend to breastfeed should be encouraged to express their breast milk to establish and maintain milk supply. If possible, a dedicated breast pump should be provided. Prior to expressing breast milk, mothers should practice hand hygiene.1 After each pumping session, all parts that come into contact with breast milk should be thoroughly washed and the entire pump should be appropriately disinfected per the manufacturer’s instructions. This expressed breast milk should be fed to the newborn by a healthy caregiver.
Hospital Discharge
Discharge for postpartum women should follow recommendations described in the Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19.
For infants with pending testing results or who test negative for the virus that causes COVID-19 upon hospital discharge, caretakers should take steps to reduce the risk of transmission to the infant, including following the Interim Guidance for Preventing Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Homes and Residential Communities.
1 Hand hygiene includes use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60% to 95% alcohol before and after all patient contact, contact with potentially infectious material, and before putting on and upon removal of PPE, including gloves. Hand hygiene can also be performed by washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are visibly soiled, use soap and water before returning to alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Interim Guidance for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems and 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for COVID-19 in the United States
This guidance applies to all first responders, including law enforcement, fire services, emergency medical services, and emergency management officials, who anticipate close contact with persons with confirmed or possible COVID-19 in the course of their work.
Updated PPE recommendations for the care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19:
When the supply chain is restored, fit-tested EMS clinicians should return to use of respirators for patients with known or suspected COVID-19.
Updated guidance about recommended EPA-registered disinfectants to include reference to a list now posted on the EPA website.
Emergency medical services (EMS) play a vital role in responding to requests for assistance, triaging patients, and providing emergency medical treatment and transport for ill persons. However, unlike patient care in the controlled environment of a healthcare facility, care and transports by EMS present unique challenges because of the nature of the setting, enclosed space during transport, frequent need for rapid medical decision-making, interventions with limited information, and a varying range of patient acuity and jurisdictional healthcare resources.
When preparing for and responding to patients with confirmed or possible coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), close coordination and effective communications are important among 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs)— commonly known as 911 call centers, the EMS system, healthcare facilities, and the public health system. Each PSAP and EMS system should seek the involvement of an EMS medical director to provide appropriate medical oversight. For the purposes of this guidance, “EMS clinician” means prehospital EMS and medical first responders. When COVID-19 is suspected in a patient needing emergency transport, prehospital care providers and healthcare facilities should be notified in advance that they may be caring for, transporting, or receiving a patient who may have COVID-19 infection.
Updated information about COVID-19
Additional information for healthcare personnel
Case Definition for COVID-19
CDC’s most current case definition for a person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19.
Municipalities and local EMS authorities should coordinate with state and local public health, PSAPs, and other emergency call centers to determine need for modified caller queries about COVID-19, outlined below.
Development of these modified caller queries should be closely coordinated with an EMS medical director and informed by local, state, and federal public health authorities, including the city or county health department(s), state health department(s), and CDC.
PSAPs or Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) centers (as appropriate) should question callers and determine the possibility that this call concerns a person who may have signs or symptoms and risk factors for COVID-19. The query process should never supersede the provision of pre-arrival instructions to the caller when immediate lifesaving interventions (e.g., CPR or the Heimlich maneuver) are indicated. Patients in the United States who meet the appropriate criteria should be evaluated and transported as a PUI. Information on COVID-19 will be updated as the public health response proceeds. PSAPs and medical directors can access CDC’s PUI definitions here.
Information on a possible PUI should be communicated immediately to EMS clinicians before arrival on scene in order to allow use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). PSAPs should utilize medical dispatch procedures that are coordinated with their EMS medical director and with the local or state public health department.
PSAPs and EMS units that respond to ill travelers at US international airports or other ports of entry to the United States (maritime ports or border crossings) should be in contact with the CDC quarantine station of jurisdiction for the port of entry (see: CDC Quarantine Station Contact List) for planning guidance. They should notify the quarantine station when responding to that location if a communicable disease is suspected in a traveler. CDC has provided job aids for this purpose to EMS units operating routinely at US ports of entry. The PSAP or EMS unit can also call CDC’s Emergency Operations Center at (770) 488-7100 to be connected with the appropriate CDC quarantine station.
Recommendations for EMS Clinicians and Medical First Responders
EMS clinician practices should be based on the most up-to-date COVID-19 clinical recommendations and information from appropriate public health authorities and EMS medical direction.
If PSAP call takers advise that the patient is suspected of having COVID-19, EMS clinicians should put on appropriate PPE before entering the scene. EMS clinicians should consider the signs, symptoms, and risk factors of COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html).
If information about potential for COVID-19 has not been provided by the PSAP, EMS clinicians should exercise appropriate precautions when responding to any patient with signs or symptoms of a respiratory infection. Initial assessment should begin from a distance of at least 6 feet from the patient, if possible. Patient contact should be minimized to the extent possible until a facemask is on the patient. If COVID-19 is suspected, all PPE as described below should be used. If COVID-19 is not suspected, EMS clinicians should follow standard procedures and use appropriate PPE for evaluating a patient with a potential respiratory infection.
EMS clinicians who will directly care for a patient with possible COVID-19 infection or who will be in the compartment with the patient should follow Standard, Precautions and use the PPE as described below. Recommended PPE includes:
A single pair of disposable patient examination gloves. Change gloves if they become torn or heavily contaminated, and isolation gown.,
When the supply chain is restored, fit-tested EMS clinicians should return to use of respirators for patients with known or suspected COVID-19.
Other required aspects of Standard Precautions (e.g., injection safety, hand hygiene) are not emphasized in this document but can be found in the guideline titled Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings.
If possible, consult with medical control before performing aerosol-generating procedures for specific guidance.
EMS clinicians should exercise caution if an aerosol-generating procedure (e.g., bag valve mask (BVM) ventilation, oropharyngeal suctioning, endotracheal intubation, nebulizer treatment, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bi-phasic positive airway pressure (biPAP), or resuscitation involving emergency intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)) is necessary.
EMS Transport of a PUI or Patient with Confirmed COVID-19 to a Healthcare Facility (including interfacility transport)
If a patient with an exposure history and signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 requires transport to a healthcare facility for further evaluation and management (subject to EMS medical direction), the following actions should occur during transport:
EMS clinicians should notify the receiving healthcare facility that the patient has an exposure history and signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 so that appropriate infection control precautions may be taken prior to patient arrival.
Family members and other contacts of patients with possible COVID-19 should not ride in the transport vehicle, if possible. If riding in the transport vehicle, they should wear a facemask.
Follow routine procedures for a transfer of the patient to the receiving healthcare facility (e.g., wheel the patient directly into an examination room).
Any written documentation should match the verbal communication given to the emergency department providers at the time patient care was transferred.
EMS documentation should include a listing of EMS clinicians and public safety providers involved in the response and level of contact with the patient (for example, no contact with patient, provided direct patient care). This documentation may need to be shared with local public health authorities.
Cleaning EMS Transport Vehicles after Transporting a PUI or Patient with Confirmed COVID-19
Ensure that environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly, to include the provision of adequate ventilation when chemicals are in use. Doors should remain open when cleaning the vehicle.
Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures (e.g., using cleaners and water to pre-clean surfaces prior to applying an EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectant to frequently touched surfaces or objects for appropriate contact times as indicated on the product’s label) are appropriate for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare settings, including those patient-care areas in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are recommended for use against SARS-CoV-2. Refer to List N
on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2.
Clean and disinfect the vehicle in accordance with standard operating procedures. All surfaces that may have come in contact with the patient or materials contaminated during patient care (e.g., stretcher, rails, control panels, floors, walls, work surfaces) should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected using an EPA-registered hospital grade disinfectant in accordance with the product label.
Clean and disinfect reusable patient-care equipment before use on another patient, according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and regulated medical waste.
Follow-up and/or Reporting Measures by EMS Clinicians After Caring for a PUI or Patient with Confirmed COVID-19
EMS clinicians should be aware of the follow-up and/or reporting measures they should take after caring for a PUI or patient with confirmed COVID-19:
State or local public health authorities should be notified about the patient so appropriate follow-up monitoring can occur.
EMS agencies should develop policies for assessing exposure risk and management of EMS personnel potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in coordination with state or local public health authorities. Decisions for monitoring, excluding from work, or other public health actions for HCP with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 should be made in consultation with state or local public health authorities. Refer to the Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for additional information.
EMS agencies should develop sick-leave policies for EMS personnel that are nonpunitive, flexible, and consistent with public health guidance. Ensure all EMS personnel, including staff who are not directly employed by the healthcare facility but provide essential daily services, are aware of the sick-leave policies.
EMS personnel who have been exposed to a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should notify their chain of command to ensure appropriate follow-up.
Any unprotected exposure (e.g., not wearing recommended PPE) should be reported to occupational health services, a supervisor, or a designated infection control officer for evaluation.
EMS clinicians should be alert for fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat). If symptoms develop, they should self-isolate and notify occupational health services and/or their public health authority to arrange for appropriate evaluation.
The responsibilities described in this section are not specific for the care and transport of PUIs or patients with confirmed COVID-19. However, this interim guidance presents an opportunity to assess current practices and verify that training and procedures are up-to-date.
Ensure EMS clinicians are medically cleared, trained, and fit tested for respiratory protection device use (e.g., N95 filtering facepiece respirators), or medically cleared and trained in the use of an alternative respiratory protection device (e.g., Powered Air-Purifying Respirator, PAPR) whenever respirators are required. OSHA has a number of respiratory training videos
Ensure an adequate supply of or access to EPA-registered hospital grade disinfectants (see above for more information) for adequate decontamination of EMS transport vehicles and their contents.

Collection and Submission of Postmortem Specimens from Deceased Persons with Known or Suspected COVID-19, March 2020 (Interim Guidance)
Recognition that COVID-19 testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), is becoming available in public health and clinical laboratories.
Considerations for when collection and submission of postmortem specimens might be considered for both known and suspected COVID-19 cases.
CDC guidance for COVID-19 may be adapted by state and local health departments to respond to rapidly changing local circumstances.
Medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists should immediately notify their local
health department in the event of the identification of a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19.
State and local health departments who have identified a deceased known or suspected COVID-19 case can notify CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for urgent consultation if an autopsy is being considered or submission of autopsy tissue specimens or postmortem swabs to CDC for COVID-19 testing is desired. The EOC will assist local/state health departments to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately to CDC, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays.
This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Current knowledge about the disease and transmission is based on preliminary data and on what is known about similar coronaviruses. Most often, spread from a living person happens with close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. This route of transmission is not a concern when handling human remains or performing postmortem procedures. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. CDC will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available.
This document provides specific guidance for the collection and submission of postmortem specimens from deceased known or suspected COVID-19 cases. This document also provides recommendations for biosafety and infection control practices during specimen collection and handling, including during autopsy procedures. The guidance can be utilized by medical examiners, coroners, pathologists, other workers involved in providing postmortem care, and local and state health departments. Postmortem activities should be conducted with a focus on avoiding aerosol generating procedures and ensuring that if aerosol generation is likely (e.g., when using an oscillating saw) that appropriate engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) are used. These precautions and the use of Standard Precautions should ensure that appropriate work practices are used to prevent direct contact with infectious material, percutaneous injury, and hazards related to moving heavy remains and handling embalming chemicals.
Medical examiners, coroners, and other healthcare professionals should use their judgment to determine if a decedent had signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 during life and whether postmortem testing should be pursued. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). There are epidemiologic factors that may also help guide decisions about COVID-19 testing, such as documented COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction, known community transmission, contact with a known COVID-19 case, or being a part of a cluster of respiratory illness in a closed setting (e.g., a long-term care facility). Testing for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza) is strongly encouraged.
Recommendations about the type of postmortem specimens to collect vary based on whether the case of COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, as well as whether an autopsy is performed.
The following factors should be considered when determining if an autopsy will be performed for a deceased known or suspected COVID-19 case: medicolegal jurisdiction, facility environmental controls, availability of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), and family and cultural wishes.
If an autopsy is performed for a suspected COVID-19 case, collection of the following postmortem specimens is recommended:
Postmortem swab specimens for COVID-19 testing:
If an autopsy is NOT performed for a suspected COVID-19 case, collection of the following postmortem specimens is recommended:
Postmortem Nasopharyngeal Swab (NP swab) specimen for COVID-19 testing
If an autopsy is performed for a confirmed COVID-19 case, collection of the following postmortem specimens should be considered:
Other postmortem microbiologic and infectious disease testing, as indicated
In addition to postmortem specimens, any remaining specimens (e.g., NP swab, sputum, serum, stool) that may have been collected prior to death should be retained. Please refer to Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for more information.
Instructions in this section apply if only postmortem NP swabs are being collected from a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19. If an autopsy is being performed or aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) are being conducted, instructions in the section Autopsy Procedures should be followed.
If only a postmortem NP swab is being collected, individuals in the room during specimen collection should be limited to healthcare personnel (HCP) obtaining the specimen. HCP should follow Standard Precautions.
Wear a clean, long-sleeved fluid-resistant or impermeable gown to protect skin and clothing.
Use a plastic face shield or a face mask and goggles to protect the face, eyes, nose, and mouth from splashes of potentially infectious bodily fluids.
Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection (goggles or a face shield) should be followed during autopsy. Many of the following procedures are consistent with existing guidelines for safe work practices in the autopsy setting; see Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories.
AGPs such as use of an oscillating bone saw should be avoided for known or suspected COVID-19 cases. Consider using hand shears as an alternative cutting tool. If an oscillating saw is used, attach a vacuum shroud to contain aerosols.
Use a biosafety cabinet for the handling and examination of smaller specimens and other containment equipment whenever possible.
Autopsies on known or suspected COVID-19 cases should be conducted in Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (AIIRs). These rooms are at negative pressure to surrounding areas, have a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (ACH) for existing structures and 12 ACH for renovated or new structures, and have air exhausted directly outside or through a HEPA filter. Doors to the room should be kept closed except during entry and egress. If an AIIR is not available, ensure the room is negative pressure with no air recirculation to adjacent spaces. A portable HEPA recirculation unit could be placed in the room to provide further reduction in aerosols. Local airflow control (i.e., laminar flow systems) can be used to direct aerosols away from personnel. If use of an AIIR or HEPA unit is not possible, the procedure should be performed in the most protective environment possible. Air should never be returned to the building interior, but should be exhausted outdoors, away from areas of human traffic or gathering spaces and away from other air intake systems.
Fluid-resistant or impermeable gown
) that includes medical exams, fit-testing, and training.
After removing PPE, discard the PPE in the appropriate laundry or waste receptacle. Reusable PPE (e.g., goggles, face shields, and PAPRs) must be cleaned and disinfected according to the manufacturer’s recommendations before reuse. Immediately after doffing PPE, wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If hands are not visibly dirty and soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water before using alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching the face with gloved or unwashed hands. Ensure that hand hygiene facilities are readily available at the point of use (e.g., at or adjacent to the PPE doffing area).
Additional safety and health guidance is available for workers handling deceased known or suspected COVID-19 cases at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), COVID-19 website
Implementing proper biosafety and infection control practices is critical when collecting specimens. Please refer to Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for additional information.
Collection of Postmortem Swab Specimens for COVID-19 Testing
For suspected COVID-19 cases, CDC recommends collecting and testing postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs (NP swabs) and if an autopsy is performed, lower respiratory specimens (lung swabs). If the diagnosis of COVID-19 was established before death, collection of these specimens for COVID-19 testing may not be necessary. Medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists should work with their local or state health department to determine capacity for testing postmortem swab specimens.
Use only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts. Do not use calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts, as they may contain substances that inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR testing. Place swabs immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 ml of viral transport media. NP and lung swab specimens should be kept in separate vials. Refrigerate specimen at 2-8°C and ship overnight to CDC on ice pack.
First wipe the surface of each lung with an iodine-containing disinfectant clean and dry the surface; then use a sterile scalpel to cut a slit of the lung and insert the swab to collect sample on either side.
Separate postmortem specimens (e.g., NP or lung swabs) should be collected for routine testing of respiratory pathogens at either clinical or public health labs. Note that clinical laboratories should NOT attempt viral isolation from specimens collected from known or suspected COVID-19 cases.
Viral antigens and nucleic acid may be focal or sparsely distributed in patients with respiratory viral infections and are most frequently detected in respiratory epithelium of large airways. For example, larger airways (particularly primary and segmental bronchi) have the highest yield for detection of respiratory viruses by molecular testing and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Performance of specific immunohistochemical, molecular, or other assays will be determined using clinical and epidemiologic information provided by the submitter and the histopathologic features identified in the submitted tissue specimens.
Submission of Postmortem Swab Specimens for COVID-19 Testing
Medical examiners, coroners, and other healthcare professionals should work with their state and local health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories. In addition, COVID-19 testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), is becoming available in clinical laboratories. State and local health departments can contact CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on weekends or holidays, if testing of postmortem swab specimens is not available in their public health laboratory.
Label each specimen container with the patient’s ID number (e.g., medical record number), unique specimen ID (e.g., laboratory requisition number), specimen type (e.g., serum) and the date the sample was collected.
In the upper left box of the form provide the following: (1) for test requested select “Respiratory virus molecular detection (non-influenza) CDC-10401” and (2) for At CDC, bring to the attention of enter “Stephen Lindstrom: COVID-19 PUI – Autopsy specimens”.
Postmortem swab specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 cases must be packaged, shipped, and transported according to the current edition of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations
. Additional useful and detailed information on packing, shipping, and transporting specimens can be found at Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
CDC’s Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch (IDPB) can receive fixed autopsy tissue specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 cases. IDPB will perform histopathologic evaluation; testing for COVID-19, as well as other respiratory viral pathogens (e.g., influenza); and bacterial and other infections, as indicated.
Contact CDC’s Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch at pathology@cdc.gov who will provide a pre-populated CDC Form 50.34 for your convenience. Include in the email:
Enter “COVID-19” and provide any applicable CDC and State NCOV Case ID numbers in the Comments section on Page 2 of the CDC 50.34 form.
The following are general guidelines for cleaning and waste disposal following an autopsy of a decedent with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Current evidence suggests that novel coronavirus may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials.
Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures (e.g., using cleaners and water to pre-clean surfaces prior to applying Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectant products with emerging viral pathogens claims
 that are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses in these settings.
After an autopsy of a decedent with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the following recommendations apply for the autopsy room (and anteroom if applicable):
Keep ventilation systems active while cleaning is conducted; before cleaning, wait 24 hours in a non-healthcare setting, or if you know the air changes per hour of the room or area in a healthcare setting, follow the recommended wait time before cleaning.
Wear disposable gloves recommended by the manufacturer of the cleaner or disinfectant while cleaning and when handling cleaning or disinfecting solutions.
Use eye protection, such as a faceshield or goggles, if splashing of water, cleaner/disinfectant, or other fluids, is expected.
Wear a clean, long-sleeved fluid-resistant gown to protect skin and clothing.
Additional PPE may be required to protect workers against potential hazards associated with the cleaning and disinfectant products used and in accordance with the label instructions.
) that includes medical exams, fit-testing, and training.
Use disinfectant products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims
 that are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Clean the surface first, and then apply the disinfectant as instructed on the disinfectant manufacturer’s label. Ensure adequate contact time for effective disinfection.
Large areas contaminated with body fluids should be treated with disinfectant following removal of the fluid with absorbent material. The area should then be cleaned and given a final disinfection.
Small amounts of liquid waste (e.g., body fluids) can be flushed or washed down ordinary sanitary drains without special procedures.
Hard, nonporous surfaces may then be cleaned and disinfected as described above.
Follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and regulated medical waste. State and local governments should be consulted for appropriate disposal decisions.
Clean and disinfect or autoclave non-disposable instruments using routine procedures, taking appropriate precautions with sharp objects.
Wash reusable, non-launderable items (e.g., aprons) with detergent solution on the warmest setting possible, rinse with water, decontaminate using disinfectant, and allow items to dry completely before next use.
Keep camera, telephones, computer keyboards, and other items that remain in the autopsy suite (or anteroom, if applicable) as clean as possible, but treat as if they are contaminated and handle with gloves. Wipe the items after use with appropriate Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectant products with emerging viral pathogens claims
 that are expected to be effective against COVID-19. If being removed from the autopsy suite, ensure complete decontamination with appropriate disinfectant according to the manufacturer’s recommendations prior to removal and reuse.
When cleaning is complete and PPE has been removed, wash hands immediately with soap and water for 20 seconds. If hands are not visibly dirty and soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water before using alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching the face with gloved or unwashed hands. Ensure that hand hygiene facilities are readily available at the point of use (e.g., at or adjacent to the PPE doffing area).
Follow standard routine procedures when transporting the body after specimens have been collected and the body has been bagged. Disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims
 expected to be effective against COVID-19 applied according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.

Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Patients with COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings (Interim Guidance)
CDC guidance for COVID-19 may be adapted by state and local health departments to respond to rapidly changing local circumstances.
Who this is for: Healthcare personnel managing patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
What this is for: To help prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.
How to use: Reference to guide healthcare regarding discontinuing transmission-based precautions and discharging hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
Clarified that patients with COVID-19 can be discharged from a healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Meeting criteria for discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions is not a prerequisite for discharge.
Discontinuation of empiric transmission-based precautions for patients suspected of having COVID-19.
This guidance is based on available information about COVID-19 and subject to change as additional information becomes available.
For discontinuation of home isolation for COVID-19, see (Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19).
For return-to-work criteria for healthcare personnel with COVID-19, see (Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19).
Discontinuation of transmission-based precautions for patients with COVID-19:
Improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), and
Negative results of an FDA Emergency Use Authorized COVID-19 molecular assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from at least two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) [1]. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
At least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and,
At least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared
Hospitalized patients may have longer periods of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection compared to patients with mild or moderate disease. Severely immunocompromised patients (e.g., medical treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, bone marrow or solid organ transplant recipients, inherited immunodeficiency, poorly controlled HIV) may also have longer periods of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and prolonged shedding of infectious recovery. These groups may be contagious for longer than others.  In addition, placing a patient in a setting where they will have close contact with individuals at risk for severe disease warrants a conservative approach.
Hospitalized or
If testing is not readily available, facilities should use the non-test-based strategy for discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or extend the period of isolation beyond the non-test-based-strategy duration, on a case by case basis in consultation with local and state public health authorities.
Discontinuation of empiric transmission-based precautions for patients suspected of having COVID-19:
The decision to discontinue empiric Transmission-Based Precautions by excluding the diagnosis of COVID-19 for a suspected COVID-19 patient can be made based upon having negative results from at least one FDA Emergency Use Authorized COVID-19 molecular assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2.
If a higher level of clinical suspicion for COVID-19 exists, consider maintaining Transmission-Based Precautions and performing a second test for SARS-CoV-2.
If a patient suspected of having COVID-19 is never tested, the decision to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions can be made based upon using the non-test-based strategy described above.
Ultimately, clinical judgement and suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection determines whether to continue or discontinue empiric Transmission-Based Precautions.
Disposition of Patients with COVID-19:
Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated.
Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions. The decision to send the patient home should be made in consultation with the patient’s clinical care team and local or state public health departments. It should include considerations of the home’s suitability for and patient’s ability to adhere to home isolation recommendations. Guidance on implementing home care of persons who do not require hospitalization and the discontinuation of home isolation for persons with COVID-19 is available.
Transmission-Based Precautions are still required, they should go to a facility with an ability to adhere to infection prevention and control recommendations for the care of COVID-19 patients. Preferably, the patient would be placed in a location designated to care for COVID-19 residents.
Transmission-Based Precautions have been discontinued, but the patient has persistent symptoms from COVID-19 (e.g., persistent cough), they should be placed in a single room, be restricted to their room, and wear a facemask during care activities until all symptoms are completely resolved or until 14 days after illness onset, whichever is longer.
Transmission-Based Precautions have been discontinued and the patient’s symptoms have resolved, they do not require further restrictions, based upon their history of COVID-19.

Comprehensive Hospital Preparedness Checklist for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Planning for community spread of COVID-19 is critical for maintaining healthcare services during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. All U.S. hospitals should be prepared for the possible arrival of patients with COVID-19. All hospitals should ensure their staff are trained, equipped and capable of practices needed to:
Prevent the spread of respiratory diseases including COVID-19 within the facility
Promptly identify and isolate patients with possible COVID-19 and inform the correct facility staff and public health authorities
Care for a limited number of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 as part of routine operations
Potentially care for a larger number of patients in the context of an escalating outbreak while maintaining adequate care for other patients
Monitor and manage any healthcare personnel that might be exposed to COVID-19
Communicate effectively within the facility and plan for appropriate external communication related to COVID-19
The following checklist can help hospitals assess and improve their preparedness for responding to a community-wide outbreak of COVID-19. Each hospital will need to adapt this checklist to meet its unique needs and circumstances. This checklist should be used as one of several tools for evaluating current plans or in developing a comprehensive COVID-19 preparedness plan.

Preventing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Homes and Residential Communities
Recommended precautions for household members, intimate partners, and caregivers in a nonhealthcare setting1 of
A patient with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
Household members, intimate partners, and caregivers in a nonhealthcare setting may have close contact2 with a person with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a person under investigation. Close contacts should monitor their health; they should call their healthcare provider right away if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath) (see Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings.)
Make sure that you understand and can help the patient follow their healthcare provider’s instructions for medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the home and provide support for getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs.
Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or her healthcare provider and tell them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that the patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.
Household members should care for any pets in the home. Do not handle pets or other animals while sick.  For more information, see COVID-19 and Animals.
Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.
Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the patient’s blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.
When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and dispose of facemask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after removing your gloves.
Place all used disposable gloves, facemasks, and other contaminated items in a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.
Discuss any additional questions with your state or local health department or healthcare provider. Check available hours when contacting your local health department.
1Home healthcare personnel should refer to Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Known or Patients Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case

Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)
Updating recommendations regarding HCP contact tracing, monitoring, and work restrictions in selected circumstances. These include allowances for asymptomatic HCP who have had an exposure to a COVID-19 patient to continue to work after options to improve staffing have been exhausted and in consultation with their occupational health program. (See Additional Considerations and Recommendations at the end of the document)
Removed requirement under “self monitoring with delegated supervision” for healthcare facilities to actively verify absence of fever and respiratory symptoms when healthcare personnel (HCP) report for work. This is now optional.
Added language advising HCP to inform their occupational health program if they have travel or community-associated exposures as defined in Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in humans and in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now with SARS-CoV-2.
Published and early reports suggest spread from person-to-person most frequently happens during close exposure to a person infected with COVID-19. Person-to-person appears to occur similar to other respiratory viruses, mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.  Although not likely to be the predominant mode of transmission, it is not clear the extent to which touching a surface contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes contributes to transmission.
This interim guidance is intended to assist with assessment of risk, monitoring, and work restriction decisions for HCP with potential exposure to COVID-19.  For guidance on assessment and management of exposure risk in non-healthcare settings, refer to the Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings.  The guidance for non-healthcare settings can also be used to identify the movement, public activity and travel restrictions that apply to the HCP included here.
Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable individuals in healthcare settings, a conservative approach to HCP monitoring and restriction from work was taken to quickly identify early symptoms and prevent transmission from potentially contagious HCP to patients, HCP, and visitors.  The signs and symptoms* described in this guidance are broader than those described when assessing exposures for individuals not working in healthcare.  Healthcare facilities should have a low threshold for evaluating symptoms and testing symptomatic HCP, particularly those who fall into the high- and medium- risk categories described in this guidance.
This guidance is based on currently available data about COVID-19. Recommendations regarding which HCP are restricted from work may not anticipate every potential scenario and will change if indicated by new information.
Healthcare facilities, in consultation with public health authorities, should use clinical judgement as well as the principles outlined in this guidance to assign risk and determine need for work restrictions.  CDC remains available for further consultation by calling the Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States.
For guidance on risk assessment and public health management of persons not working in a U.S. healthcare setting refer to:  Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings.
For infection prevention and control guidance for healthcare settings caring for Persons with Known or Under Investigation (PUI) for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), refer to the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Known or Patients Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting.
Self-monitoring means HCP should monitor themselves for fever by taking their temperature twice a day and remain alert for respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat)*. Anyone on self-monitoring should be provided a plan for whom to contact if they develop fever or respiratory symptoms during the self-monitoring period to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.
Active monitoring means that the state or local public health authority assumes responsibility for establishing regular communication with potentially exposed people to assess for the presence of fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat)*. For HCP with high- or medium-risk exposures, CDC recommends this communication occurs at least once each day. The mode of communication can be determined by the state or local public health authority and may include telephone calls or any electronic or internet-based means of communication.
For HCP, active monitoring can be delegated by the health department to the HCP’s healthcare facility occupational health or infection control program, if both the health department and the facility are in agreement. Note, inter-jurisdictional coordination will be needed if HCP live in a different local health jurisdiction than where the healthcare facility is located.
Self-Monitoring with delegated supervision in a healthcare setting means HCP perform self-monitoring with oversight by their healthcare facility’s occupational health or infection control program in coordination with the health department of jurisdiction, if both the health department and the facility are in agreement. On days HCP are scheduled to work, healthcare facilities could consider measuring temperature and assessing symptoms prior to starting work.  Alternatively, a facility may consider having HCP report temperature and absence of symptoms to occupational health prior to starting work.  Modes of communication may include telephone calls or any electronic or internet-based means of communication.
Occupational health or infection control personnel should establish points of contact between the organization, the self-monitoring personnel, and the local or state health departments of authority in the location where self-monitoring personnel will be during the self-monitoring period. This communication should result in agreement on a plan for medical evaluation of personnel who develop fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat)* during the self-monitoring period. The plan should include instructions for notifying occupational health and the local public health authority, and transportation arrangements to a designated hospital, if medically necessary, with advance notice if fever or respiratory symptoms occur. The supervising organization should remain in contact with HCP through the self-monitoring period to manage self-monitoring activities and provide timely and appropriate follow-up if symptoms occur in a HCP. Note, inter-jurisdictional coordination will be needed if HCP live in a different local health jurisdiction than where the healthcare facility is located.
Close contact for healthcare exposures is defined as follows: a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), of a person with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time (such as caring for or visiting the patient; or sitting within 6 feet of the patient in a healthcare waiting area or room); or b) having unprotected direct contact with infectious secretions or excretions of the patient (e.g., being coughed on, touching used tissues with a bare hand).
Data are limited for definitions of close contact.  Factors for consideration include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), clinical symptoms of the patient (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk) and whether the patient was wearing a facemask (which can efficiently block respiratory secretions from contaminating others and the environment), PPE used by personnel, and whether aerosol-generating procedures were performed.
Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure.  However, until more is known about transmission risks, it is reasonable to consider an exposure greater than a few minutes as a prolonged exposure.  Brief interactions are less likely to result in transmission; however, clinical symptoms of the patient and type of interaction (e.g., did the patient cough directly into the face of the HCP) remain important.  Recommendations will be updated as more information becomes available.
Risk stratification can be made in consultation with public health authorities.  Examples of brief interactions include: briefly entering the patient room without having direct contact with the patient or their secretions/excretions, brief conversation at a triage desk with a patient who was not wearing a facemask. See Table 1 for more detailed information.
Healthcare Personnel:  For the purposes of this document HCP refers to all paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials, including body substances; contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; contaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air. For this document, HCP does not include clinical laboratory personnel.
While body fluids other than respiratory secretions have not been clearly implicated in transmission of COVID-19, unprotected contact with other body fluids, including blood, stool, vomit, and urine, might put HCP at risk of COVID-19.
Table 1 describes possible scenarios that can be used to assist with risk assessment.  These scenarios do not cover all potential exposure scenarios and should not replace an individual assessment of risk for the purpose of clinical decision making or individualized public health management. Any public health decisions that place restrictions on an individual’s or group’s movements or impose specific monitoring requirements should be based on an assessment of risk for the individual or group.  Healthcare facilities, in consultation with public health authorities should use the concepts outlined in this guidance along with clinical judgement to assign risk and determine need for work restrictions.
For this guidance high-risk exposures refer to HCP who have had prolonged close contact with patients with COVID-19 who were not wearing a facemask while HCP nose and mouth were exposed to material potentially infectious with the virus causing COVID-19.  Being present in the room for procedures that generate aerosols or during which respiratory secretions are likely to be poorly controlled (e.g., cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation, extubation, bronchoscopy, nebulizer therapy, sputum induction) on patients with COVID-19 when the healthcare providers’ eyes, nose, or mouth were not protected, is also considered high-risk.
Medium-risk exposures generally include HCP who had prolonged close contact with patients with COVID-19 who were wearing a facemask while HCP nose and mouth were exposed to material potentially infectious with the virus causing COVID-19.  Some low-risk exposures are considered medium-risk depending on the type of care activity performed.  For example, HCP who were wearing a gown, gloves, eye protection and a facemask (instead of a respirator) during an aerosol-generating procedure would be considered to have a medium-risk exposure.  If an aerosol-generating procedure had not been performed, they would have been considered low-risk.  See Table 1 for additional examples.
Low-risk exposures generally refer to brief interactions with patients with COVID-19 or prolonged close contact with patients who were wearing a facemask for source control while HCP were wearing a facemask or respirator. Use of eye protection, in addition to a facemask or respirator would further lower the risk of exposure.
Proper adherence to currently recommended infection control practices, including all recommended PPE, should protect HCP having prolonged close contact with patients infected with COVID-19.  However, to account for any inconsistencies in use or adherence that could result in unrecognized exposures HCP should still perform self-monitoring with delegated supervision.
HCP with no direct patient contact and no entry into active patient management areas who adhere to routine safety precautions do not have a risk of exposure to COVID-19 (i.e., they have no identifiable risk.)
Currently, this guidance applies to HCP with potential exposure in a healthcare setting to patients with confirmed COVID-19.  However, HCP exposures could involve a PUI who is awaiting testing.  Implementation of monitoring and work restrictions described in this guidance could be applied to HCP exposed to a PUI if test results for the PUI are not expected to return within 48 to 72 hours.  A record of HCP exposed to a PUI should be maintained and HCP should be encouraged to perform self-monitoring while awaiting test results.  If the results will be delayed more than 72 hours or the patient is positive for COVID-19, then the monitoring and work restrictions described in this document should be followed.
Table 1: Epidemiologic Risk Classification1 for Asymptomatic Healthcare Personnel Following Exposure to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) or their Secretions/Excretions in a Healthcare Setting, and their Associated Monitoring and Work Restriction Recommendations
Both high- and medium-risk exposures place HCP at more than low-risk for developing infection; therefore, the recommendations for active monitoring and work restrictions are the same for these exposures.  However, these risk categories were created to align with risk categories described in the Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings, which outlines criteria for quarantine and travel restrictions specific to high-risk exposures.  Use that Interim Guidance for information about the movement, public activity, and travel restrictions that apply to the HCP included here.
Note:  While respirators confer a higher level of protection than facemasks, and are recommended when caring for patients with COVID-19, facemasks still confer some level of protection to HCP, which was factored into our assessment of risk.        
Table 1: Epidemiologic Risk Classification for Asymptomatic Healthcare Personnel Following Exposure to Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection or their Secretions/Excretions in a Healthcare Setting, and their Associated Monitoring and Work Restriction Recommendations
Epidemiologic risk factors Exposure category Recommended Monitoring for COVID-19 (until 14 days after last potential exposure) Work Restrictions for Asymptomatic HCP
Prolonged close contact with a COVID-19 patient who was wearing a facemask (i.e., source control)
Prolonged close contact with a COVID-19 patient who was not wearing a facemask (i.e., no source control)
HCP=healthcare personnel; PPE=personal protective equipment
Proper adherence to currently recommended infection control practices, including all recommended PPE, should protect HCP having prolonged close contact with patients infected with COVID-19. However, to account for any inconsistencies in use or adherence that could result in unrecognized exposures, HCP should still perform self-monitoring with delegated supervision.
III. Recommendations for Monitoring Based on COVID-19 Exposure Risk
HCP in any of the risk exposure categories who develop signs or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 must contact their established point of contact (public health authorities or their facility’s occupational health program) for medical evaluation prior to returning to work
HCP in the high- or medium-risk category should undergo active monitoring, including restriction from work in any healthcare setting until 14 days after their last exposure. If they develop any fever (measured temperature >100.0oF or subjective fever) OR respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat)* they should immediately self-isolate (separate themselves from others) and notify their local or state public health authority and healthcare facility promptly so that they can coordinate consultation and referral to a healthcare provider for further evaluation.
HCP in the low-risk category should perform self-monitoring with delegated supervision until 14 days after the last potential exposure.  Asymptomatic HCP in this category are not restricted from work.  They should check their temperature twice daily and remain alert for respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat)*. They should ensure they are afebrile and asymptomatic before leaving home and reporting for work. If they do not have fever or respiratory symptoms they may report to work.  If they develop fever (measured temperature > 100.0 oF or subjective fever) OR respiratory symptoms they should immediately self-isolate (separate themselves from others) and notify their local or state public health authority or healthcare facility promptly so that they can coordinate consultation and referral to a healthcare provider for further evaluation.On days HCP are scheduled to work, healthcare facilities could consider measuring  temperature and assessing symptoms prior to starting work.  Alternatively, facilities could consider having HCP report temperature and symptoms to occupational health prior to starting work.  Modes of communication may include telephone calls or any electronic or internet-based means of communication.
Proper adherence to currently recommended infection control practices, including all recommended PPE, should protect HCP having prolonged close contact with patients infected with COVID-19.  However, to account for any inconsistencies in use or adherence that could result in unrecognized exposures, HCP should still perform self-monitoring with delegated supervision as described under the low-risk exposure category.
HCP with potential exposures to COVID-19 in community settings, should have their exposure risk assessed according to CDC guidance.  HCP should inform their facility’s occupational health program that they have had a community or travel-associated exposure.  HCP who have a community or travel-associated exposure should undergo monitoring as defined by that guidance.  Those who fall into the high- or medium- risk category described there should be excluded from work in a healthcare setting until 14 days after their exposure. HCP who develop signs or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 should contact their established point of contact (public health authorities or their facility’s occupational health program) for medical evaluation prior to returning to work.
While contact tracing and risk assessment, with appropriate implementation of HCP work restrictions, of potentially exposed HCP remains the recommended strategy for identifying and reducing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to HCP, patients, and others, it is not practical or achievable in all situations.  Community transmission of COVID-19 in the United States has been reported in multiple areas. This development means some recommended actions (e.g., contact tracing and risk assessment of all potentially exposed HCP) are impractical for implementation by healthcare facilities.  In the setting of community transmission, all HCP are at some risk for exposure to COVID-19, whether in the workplace or in the community.  Devoting resources to contact tracing and retrospective risk assessment could divert resources from other important infection prevention and control activities.  Facilities should shift emphasis to more routine practices, which include asking HCP to report recognized exposures, regularly monitor themselves for fever and symptoms of respiratory infection and not report to work when ill.  Facilities should develop a plan for how they will screen for symptoms and evaluate ill HCP.  This could include having HCP report absence of fever and symptoms prior to starting work each day.
Facilities could consider allowing asymptomatic HCP who have had an exposure to a COVID-19 patient to continue to work after options to improve staffing have been exhausted and in consultation with their occupational health program.  These HCP should still report temperature and absence of symptoms each day prior to starting work.  Facilities could have exposed HCP wear a facemask while at work for the 14 days after the exposure event if there is a sufficient supply of facemasks. If HCP develop even mild symptoms consistent with COVID-19, they must cease patient care activities, don a facemask (if not already wearing), and notify their supervisor or occupational health services prior to leaving work.
* Fever is either measured temperature >100.0oF or subjective fever. Note that fever may be intermittent or may not be present in some patients, such as those who are elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs). Clinical judgement should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations. Respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat. Medical evaluation may be recommended for lower temperatures (<100.0oF) or other symptoms (e.g., muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain headache, runny nose, fatigue) based on assessment by public health authorities.

CDC’s guidance for Considerations for Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids outlines the scientific evidence and information on national and international standards, test methods, and specifications for fluid-resistant and impermeable gowns and coveralls used in healthcare.
Many organizations have published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in medical settings. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Association of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI): ANSI/AAMI PB70:2012
describes the liquid barrier performance and a classification of surgical and isolation gowns for use in health care facilities.
As with any type of PPE, the key to proper selection and use of protective clothing is to understand the hazards and the risk of exposure. Some of the factors important to assessing the risk of exposure in health facilities include source, modes of transmission, pressures and types of contact, and duration and type of tasks to be performed by the user of the PPE. (Technical Information Report (TIR) 11
What type of gown is recommended for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?
Nonsterile, disposable patient isolation gowns, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for use by patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
What types of gowns are available for healthcare personnel to protect from COVID-19?
While the transmissibility of COVID-19 is not fully understood, gowns are available that protect against microorganisms. The choice of gown should be made based on the level of risk of contamination. Certain areas of surgical and isolation gowns are defined as “critical zones” where direct contact with blood, body fluids, and/or other potentially infectious materials is most likely to occur. (ANSI/AAMI PB70
If there is a medium to high risk of contamination and need for a large critical zone, isolation gowns that claim moderate to high barrier protection (ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 3 or 4
For healthcare activities with low, medium, or high risk of contamination, surgical gowns (ANSI/AAMI PB70 Levels 1-4
), can be used. These gowns are intended to be worn by healthcare personnel during surgical procedures.
If the risk of bodily fluid exposure is low or minimal, gowns that claim minimal or low levels of barrier protection (ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 1 or 2
CDC’s guidance for Considerations for Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids provides additional comparisons between gowns and coveralls.
Gowns are easier to put on and, in particular, to take off. They are generally more familiar to healthcare workers and hence more likely to be used and removed correctly. These factors also facilitate training in their correct use.
Coveralls typically provide 360-degree protection because they are designed to cover the whole body, including the back and lower legs, and sometimes the head and feet as well. Surgical/isolation gowns do not provide continuous whole-body protection (e.g., they have possible openings in the back, and typically provide coverage to the mid-calf only).
It is important for Health Care Providers (HCP) to perform hand hygiene before and after removing PPE. Hand hygiene should be performed by using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60-95% alcohol or washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are visibly soiled, soap and water should be used before returning to alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Is it acceptable for emergency medical services to wear coveralls as an alternative to gowns when COVID-19 is suspected in a patient needing emergency transport?
Unlike patient care in the controlled environment of a healthcare facility, care and transport by EMS present unique challenges because of the nature of the setting. Coveralls are an acceptable alternative to gowns when caring for and transporting suspect COVID-19 patients.  While no clinical studies have been done to compare gowns and coveralls, both have been used effectively by healthcare workers in clinical settings during patient care. CDC’s Considerations for Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids guidance provides a comparison between gowns and coveralls, including test methods and performance requirements. Coveralls typically provide 360-degree protection because they are designed to cover the whole body, including the back and lower legs, and sometimes the head and feet as well.  This added coverage may be necessary for some work tasks involved in medical transport. However, coveralls may lead to increased heat stress compared to gowns due to the total area covered by the fabric. Training on how to properly remove (doff) a coverall is important to prevent self-contamination. Comparatively, gowns are easier to put on and, in particular, to take off.
What type of glove is recommended to care for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in healthcare settings?
Nonsterile disposable patient examination gloves, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
Is double gloving necessary when caring for suspected or confirmed CoVID-19 patients in healthcare settings?
Are extended length gloves necessary when caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in healthcare settings?
According to CDC Guidance, extended length gloves are not necessary when providing care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Extended length gloves can be used, but CDC is not specifically recommending them at this time.
It is important for HCP to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE. Hand hygiene should be performed by using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60-95% alcohol or washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.  If hands are visibly soiled, soap and water should be used before returning to alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

CDC does not recommend the routine use of respirators outside of workplace settings (in the community). Most often, spread of respiratory viruses from person-to-person happens among close contacts (within 6 feet). CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as avoiding people who are sick, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue. People who are sick should stay home and not go into crowded public places or visit people in hospitals. Workers who are sick should follow CDC guidelines and stay home when they are sick.
A respirator is a personal protective device that is worn on the face or head and covers at least the nose and mouth. A respirator is used to reduce the wearer’s risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles (including infectious agents), gases or vapors. Respirators, including those intended for use in healthcare settings, are certified by the CDC/NIOSH.
An N95 FFR is a type of respirator which removes particles from the air that are breathed through it. These respirators filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles. N95 FFRs are capable of filtering out all types of particles, including bacteria and viruses.
N95 respirators reduce the wearer’s exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets. N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.
Not everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able to wear a respirator safely.
Unlike NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales.
The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes.  Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated.
A surgical N95 (also referred as a medical respirator) is recommended only for use by healthcare personnel (HCP) who need protection from both airborne and fluid hazards (e.g., splashes, sprays). These respirators are not used or needed outside of healthcare settings. In times of shortage, only HCP who are working in a sterile field or who may be exposed to high velocity splashes, sprays, or splatters of blood or body fluids should wear these respirators, such as in operative or procedural settings. Most HCP caring for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients should not need to use surgical N95 respirators and can use standard N95 respirators.
If a surgical N95 is not available for use in operative or procedural settings, then an unvalved N95 respirator may be used with a faceshield to help block high velocity streams of blood and body fluids.
The requirements for surgical N95 respirators that make them resistant to high velocity streams of body fluids and help protect the sterile field can result in a design that has a higher breathing resistance (makes it more difficult to breath) than a typical N95 respirator. Also, surgical N95 respirators are designed without exhalation valves which are sometimes perceived as warmer inside the mask than typical N95 respirators. If you are receiving complaints, you may consider having employees who are not doing surgery, not working in a sterile field, or not potentially exposed to high velocity streams of body fluids wear a standard N95 with an exhalation valve.
In times of increased demand and decreased supply, consideration can be made to use N95 respirators past their intended shelf life. However, the potential exists that the respirator will not perform to the requirements for which it was certified. Over time, components such as the strap and nose bridge may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Prior to use of N95 respirators, the HCP should inspect the respirator and perform a seal check. Additionally, expired respirators may potentially no longer meet the certification requirements set by NIOSH. For further guidance, visit Release of Stockpiled N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators Beyond the Manufacturer-Designated Shelf Life: Considerations for the COVID-19 Response.
What methods should healthcare facilities consider in order to avoid unintentional loss of PPE during COVID-19?
Monitoring PPE supply inventory and maintaining control over PPE supplies may help prevent unintentional product losses that may occur due to theft, damage, or accidental loss. Inventory systems should be employed to track daily usage and identify areas of higher than expected use.  This information can be used to implement additional conservation strategies tailored to specific patient care areas such as hospital units or outpatient facilities.  Inventory tracking within a health system may also assist in confirming PPE deliveries and optimizing distribution of PPE supplies to specific facilities.

This interim guidance is for clinicians caring for patients with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Characteristics of patients with confirmed COVID-19 based on recent epidemiologic data from China, including characteristics of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit and data on pediatric cases

Among reports that describe the clinical presentation of patients with confirmed COVID-19, most are limited to hospitalized patients with pneumonia. The incubation period is estimated at 4 days (interquartile range: 2 to 7 days). [1] Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2-14 days. Frequently reported signs and symptoms of patients admitted to the hospital include fever (77–98%), cough (46%–82%), myalgia or fatigue (11–52%), and shortness of breath (3-31%) at illness onset. [2–5] Among 1,099 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, fever was present in 44% at hospital admission, and developed in 89% during hospitalization. [6]  Other less commonly reported respiratory symptoms include sore throat, headache, cough with sputum production and/or hemoptysis. Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. The fever course among patients with COVID-19 is not fully understood; it may be prolonged and intermittent. A limited number of reports describe identification of asymptomatic or subclinical infection on the basis of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or live virus from throat swab specimens of contacts of confirmed patients. [7–8]
Risk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness. Among more than 44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China as of Feb 11, 2020, most occurred among patients aged 30–69 years (77.8%), and approximately 19% were severely or critically ill [9]. Case-fatality proportion among cases aged ≥60 years was: 60-69 years: 3.6%; 70-79 years: 8%; ≥80 years: 14.8%. Patients who reported no underlying medical conditions had an overall case fatality of 0.9%, but case fatality was higher for patients with comorbidities: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7% for diabetes, and 6% each for chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer. Case fatality for patients who developed respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction was 49%. [9]
Limited information is available about the clinical presentation, clinical course, and risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children. Of confirmed COVID-19 patients in China as of Feb 11, 2020, only 2.1% were aged <20 years, and no deaths were reported among those <10 years of age [9]. From limited published reports, signs and symptoms among children with COVID-19 may be more mild than adults, with most pediatric patients presenting with fever, cough, congestion, and rhinorrhea [10, 12–13], and one report of primarily gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea) [13]. Prolonged detection of SARS-CoV RNA has been reported in respiratory specimens (up to 22 days after illness onset) and stool specimens (at least 30 days after illness onset) [10–11]. Severe complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock were reported in a 13-month old with COVID-19 in China [13].
Clinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection to mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.[2,5] In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5–13 days). [2] In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.[1] Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17–29% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. [2,4] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.[3]
Approximately 20-30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support.[2–3] Compared to patients not admitted to an intensive care unit, critically ill patients were older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), and were more likely to have underlying co-morbid conditions (72% versus 37%). [3] Among critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 11–64% received high-flow oxygen therapy and 47-71% received mechanical ventilation; some hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (4–42%).[3–4,9] A small proportion have also been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3–12%).[3–4,9] Other reported complications include cardiac injury, arrhythmia, septic shock, liver dysfunction, acute kidney injury, and multi-organ failure. Post-mortem biopsies in one patient who died of ARDS reported pulmonary findings of diffuse alveolar damage. [14]
An overall case fatality proportion of 2.3% has been reported among confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China. [9] However, the majority of these cases were among hospitalized patients and therefore this estimate of mortality is likely biased upward. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4–15%.[2–4] Among critically ill COVID-19 patients in China, the reported case fatality proportion was 49%. In a report from one hospital, 61.5% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 had died by day 28 of ICU admission. [9,15]
Information on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection 2019-Novel Coronavirus. After initial confirmation of COVID-10, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.
The most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9–25%), leukocytosis (24–30%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%). [2,4] Among 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphocytopenia was present in 83%; 36% had thrombocytopenia, and 34% had leukopenia. [6] Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission. Chest CT images have shown bilateral involvement in most patients. Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date. [2–4, 16–24] However, one study that evaluated the time from symptom onset to initial CT scan found that 56% of patients who presented within 2 days had a normal CT. [20]
Limited data are available about the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious virus in clinical specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the virus has been isolated in cell culture from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In one case series  SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA levels in the first 3 days after symptom onset were higher in specimens collected from the nose than from the throat (as demonstrated by lower cycle threshold values in the nose). [25] A similar time course and pattern of viral RNA detection was reported in one asymptomatic patient after exposure to a patient with confirmed COVID-19. [25]
SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. [26–29]. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known. It is possible that RNA could be detected for weeks, which has occurred in some cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. [30–37] Viable SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens. In contrast, viable MERS-CoV has been isolated only from respiratory tract specimens. [37–39]
For information regarding infection prevention and control recommendations, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
Patients with a mild clinical presentation may not initially require hospitalization. However, clinical signs and symptoms may worsen with progression to lower respiratory tract disease in the second week of illness; all patients should be monitored closely. Possible risk factors for progressing to severe illness may include, but are not limited to, older age, and underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, and pregnancy.
The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. For more information, see Evaluating and Reporting Persons Under Investigation (PUI)
No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.
Corticosteroids should be avoided, because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients, unless indicated for other reasons. [31, 40–42] For example, for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or for septic shock per Surviving Sepsis guidelines for adults

There are currently no antiviral drugs licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients with COVID-19. In the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and collaborators are working on development of candidate vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. Some in-vitro or in-vivo studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of compounds against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at this time.
Remdesivir is an investigational antiviral drug that was reported to have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. [43]  Some patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting. In China, multiple clinical trials of investigational therapeutics have been implemented, including two clinical trials of remdesivir. An NIH adaptive randomized controlled clinical trial
of investigational therapeutics for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States was approved by the Food and Drug Administration; the first investigational therapeutic to be studied is remdesivir. Other remdesivir trials for COVID-19 patients in the U.S. are available (participants with severe
coronavirus disease). Some COVID-19 patients have received uncontrolled treatment with other investigational antivirals. [4, 28, 44] For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19, see clinicaltrials.gov
In the absence of an approved vaccine, community mitigation measures are the primary way to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission among persons in the community, and adherence to recommended infection prevention and control measures can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread in healthcare facilities. In the absence of an approved therapeutic with demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19, clinical management of COVID-19 patients includes avoidance of corticosteroids, and supportive care of complications, including advanced organ support.
Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation
For recommendations on discontinuation of transmission-based precautions or home isolation for patients who have recovered from COVID-19 illness, please see: Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 and Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19

Information for Healthcare Professionals: COVID-19 and Underlying Conditions
Patients at higher risk for infection, severe illness, and poorer outcomes from COVID-19 should protect themselves. Guidance for patients includes:
Call your healthcare provider if you are sick with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
Follow CDC travel guidelines and the recommendations of your state and local health officials.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based upon available information to date, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include:
People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
People who have heart disease with complications
People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [(BM]I)≥40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver disease might also be at risk
People who are pregnant should be monitored since they are known to be at risk with severe viral illness, however, to date data on COVID-19 has not shown increased risk
Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications

Discontinuation of Home Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 (Interim Guidance)
CDC guidance for COVID-19 may be adapted by state and local health departments to respond to rapidly changing local circumstances.
Healthcare providers and public health officials managing persons with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) under home isolation.
New guidance is added for a strategy to discontinue home isolation without testing.
Limited information is available to characterize the spectrum of clinical illness, transmission efficiency, and the duration of viral shedding for persons with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This guidance is based on available information about COVID-19 and  subject to change as additional information becomes available.
For Hospitalized Patients, see (Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions Among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19).
For Persons with COVID-19 Under Home Isolation:
The decision to discontinue home isolation should be made in the context of local circumstances. Options now include both 1) a time-since-illness-onset and time-since-recovery (non-test-based) strategy, and 2) a test-based strategy.
Persons with COVID-19 who have symptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue home isolation under the  following conditions:
At least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and,
At least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.
Persons who have COVID-19 who have symptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue home isolation under the following conditions:
Improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) and
Negative results of an FDA Emergency Use Authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected ≥24 hours apart** (total of two negative specimens). See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons Under Investigation (PUIs) for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)for specimen collection guidance.
Individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have not had any symptoms may discontinue home isolation when at least 7 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic  test and have had no subsequent illness.
**All test results should be final before isolation is ended. Testing guidance is based upon limited information and is subject to change as more information becomes available.

Q: Who is at risk for COVID-19?
A: Currently, those at greatest risk of infection are persons who have had prolonged, unprotected close contact with a patient with symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 and those who live in or have recently been to areas with sustained transmission.
Q. My patient has one of the underlying medical conditions listed what should I tell my patient?
You know your patient – their overall health and how well their conditions are managed. Use your clinical judgement to evaluate on a case by case basis.
Tell patients with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness or poorer outcomes from COVID-19:
Encourage patients to closely follow their care plans for management of their chronic disease, including better glycemic or blood pressure control
Call your healthcare provider if you are sick with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
Follow CDC travel guidelines and the recommendations of your state and local health officials.
Fear and anxiety about a disease can feel overwhelming, especially for those who might be at higher risk or are experiencing social isolation, and for healthcare providers that are treating patients at higher risk. Do what you can to take care of your mental health and encourage your patients to do the same.
Q. What is my patient’s risk if they have one of the underlying medical conditions listed?
There is insufficient information on COVID-19 to determine risk for each underlying medical condition. Epidemiologists at CDC are analyzing data around the clock to help us more precisely understand the risks of COVID-19. Information will be shared as soon as it’s available.
You know your patient – their overall health and how well their conditions are managed. Use your clinical judgement to evaluate on a case by case basis.
Q: Who is at risk for severe disease from COVID-19?
A. COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based upon available information to date, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include:
People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
People who have heart disease with complications
People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [(BM]I)≥40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver disease might also be at risk
People who are pregnant should be monitored since they are known to be at risk with severe viral illness, however, to date data on COVID-19 has not shown increased risk
Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications
A: The onset and duration of viral shedding and period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infection with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, but it is not yet known what role asymptomatic infection plays in transmission. Similarly, the role of pre-symptomatic transmission (infection detection during the incubation period prior to illness onset) is unknown. Existing literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2–14 days.
Q: Which body fluids can spread infection?
A: Very limited data are available about detection of SARS-CoV-2 and infectious virus in clinical specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but whether infectious virus is present in extrapulmonary specimens is currently unknown. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer, which has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, in contrast – viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2.
Q: Can people who recover from COVID-19 be infected again?
A: The immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood. Patients with MERS-CoV infection are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover, but it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19.
Q: How should healthcare personnel protect themselves when evaluating a patient who may have COVID-19?
A: Although the transmission dynamics have yet to be determined, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19. Healthcare personnel evaluating PUI or providing care for patients with confirmed COVID-19 should use, Standard  Transmission-based Precautions. See the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Known or Patients Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.
Q: Are pregnant healthcare personnel at increased risk for adverse outcomes if they care for patients with COVID-19?
A: Pregnant healthcare personnel (HCP) should follow risk assessment and infection control guidelines for HCP exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all HCP in healthcare settings. Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited; facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on staffing availability.
Q: Should any diagnostic or therapeutic interventions be withheld due to concerns about transmission of COVID-19?
A: Patients should receive any interventions they would normally receive as standard of care. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use Standard and Transmission-based Precautions.
Q: How do you test a patient for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?
A: See recommendations for reporting, testing, and specimen collection at Interim Guidance for Healthcare Professionals.
Q: Will existing respiratory virus panels, such as those manufactured by Biofire or Genmark, detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?
A: No. These multi-pathogen molecular assays can detect a number of human respiratory viruses, including other coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory illness, but they do not detect COVID-19.
Q: How is COVID-19 treated?
Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is focused on supportive care of complications, including advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted.
There are currently no antiviral drugs licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat COVID-19. Some in-vitro or in-vivo studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of some agents against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from observational studies or randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at this time. Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, was reported to have in-vitro activity against COVID-19. A small number of patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting. A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir
for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory disease has been implemented in China. A randomized open label trial
of combination lopinavir-ritonavir treatment has been also been conducted in patients with COVID-19 in China, but no results are available to date. trials of other potential therapeutics for COVID-19 are being planned. For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection, see clinicaltrials.gov
See Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Q: Should post-exposure prophylaxis be used for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19?
A: There is currently no FDA-approved post-exposure prophylaxis for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19. For more information on movement restrictions, monitoring for symptoms, and evaluation after possible exposure to COVID-19 See Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings and Interim U.S Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Q: Whom should healthcare providers notify if they suspect a patient has COVID-19?
A: Healthcare providers should consult with local or state health departments to determine whether patients meet criteria for a Persons Under Investigation (PUI). Providers should immediately notify infection control personnel at their facility if they suspect COVID-19 in a patient.
Q: Do patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be admitted to the hospital?
A: Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate isolation precautions. Some patients with an initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness. The decision to monitor these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in monitoring, the ability for safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. For more information, see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Known or Patients Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting and Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Q: When can patients with confirmed COVID-19 be discharged from the hospital?
A: Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital Transmission-Based Precautions described below.
Decisions to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for COVID-19 in respiratory specimens.
Criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions can be found in: Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19
Q: Are pregnant healthcare personnel at increased risk for adverse outcomes if they care for patients with COVID-19?
A: Pregnant healthcare personnel (HCP) should follow risk assessment and infection control guidelines for HCP exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all HCP in healthcare settings. Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited; facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on staffing availability.
Q: What do I need to know if a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 asks about having a pet or other animal in the home?
A: See COVID-19 and Animals.
Q: What do waste management companies need to know about wastewater and sewage coming from a healthcare facility or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or person under investigation (PUI)?
A: Waste generated in the care of PUIs or patients with confirmed COVID-19 does not present additional considerations for wastewater disinfection in the United States. Coronaviruses are susceptible to the same disinfection conditions in community and healthcare settings as other viruses, so current disinfection conditions in wastewater treatment facilities are expected to be sufficient. This includes conditions for practices such as oxidation with hypochlorite (i.e., chlorine bleach) and peracetic acid, as well as inactivation using UV irradiation.
Q: Do wastewater and sewage workers need any additional protection when handling untreated waste from healthcare or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or PUI?
A: Wastewater workers should use standard practices including basic hygiene precautions and wear the recommended PPE as prescribed for their current work tasks when handling untreated waste. There is no evidence to suggest that employees of wastewater plants need any additional protections in relation to COVID-19.
Q: Should medical waste or general waste from healthcare facilities treating PUIs and patients with confirmed COVID-19 be handled any differently or need any additional disinfection?
A: Medical waste (trash) coming from healthcare facilities treating COVID-2019 patients is no different than waste coming from facilities without COVID-19 patients. CDC’s guidance states that management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should be performed in accordance with routine procedures. There is no evidence to suggest that facility waste needs any additional disinfection.

What Healthcare Personnel Should Know about Caring for Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19 Infection
Healthcare personnel (HCP) are on the front lines of caring for patients with confirmed or possible infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and therefore have an increased risk of exposure to this virus. HCPs can minimize their risk of exposure when caring for confirmed or possible COVID-19 patients by following Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
How COVID-19 Spreads
There is much to learn about the newly emerged COVID-19, including how and how easily it spreads. Based on what is currently known about COVID-19 and what is known about other coronaviruses, spread is thought to occur mostly from person-to-person via respiratory droplets among close contacts.
being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a patient with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time.
having direct contact with infectious secretions from a patient with COVID-19. Infectious secretions may include sputum, serum, blood, and respiratory droplets.
If close contact occurs while not wearing all recommended PPE, healthcare personnel may be at risk of infection.
Healthcare personnel caring for patients with confirmed or possible COVID-19 should adhere to CDC recommendations for infection prevention and control (IPC):
Assess and triage these patients with acute respiratory symptoms and risk factors for COVID-19 to minimize chances of exposure, including placing a facemask on the patient and placing them in an examination room with the door closed.
Use Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for patients with confirmed or possible COVID-19.
Perform hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand rub before and after all patient contact, contact with potentially infectious material, and before putting on and upon removal of PPE, including gloves. Use soap and water if hands are visibly soiled.
Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection
Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures are appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings, including those patient-care areas in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are recommended for use against SARS-CoV-2. Management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should also be performed in accordance with routine procedures.
When to Contact Occupational Health Services
If you have an unprotected exposure (i.e., not wearing recommended PPE) to a confirmed or possible COVID-19 patient, contact your supervisor or occupational health immediately.
If you develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, cough, or difficulty breathing), do not report to work. Contact your occupational health services.

CDC Health Advisory
Update and Interim Guidance on Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
CDC continues to closely monitor an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 that was initially detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. This HAN Update provides a situational update and guidance to state and local health departments and health care providers.
Contact your local or state health department
Healthcare providers should immediately notify their local
 health department in the event of the identification of a PUI for COVID-19. When working with your local or state health department check their available hours.
Criteria to Guide Evaluation and Laboratory Testing for COVID-19
Clinicians considering testing of persons with possible COVID-19 should continue to work with their local and state health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories, or use COVID-19 diagnostic testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) through clinical laboratories.  Increasing testing capacity will allow clinicians to consider COVID-19 testing for a wider group of symptomatic patients.
Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever1 and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). Priorities for testing include:
Other considerations that may guide testing are epidemiologic factors such as the occurrence of local community transmission of COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction. Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness.
Priorities for testing patients with suspected COVID-19 infection
Priorities for Laboratory Testing for COVID-19
Ensure optimal care options for all hospitalized patients, lessen the risk of nosocomial infections, and maintain the integrity of the healthcare system
Hospitalized patients
Symptomatic healthcare workers
Patients in long-term care facilities with symptoms
Patients 65 years of age and older with symptoms
Patients with underlying conditions with symptoms
First responders with symptoms
As resources allow, test individuals in the surrounding community of rapidly increasing hospital cases to decrease community spread, and ensure health of essential workers
Critical infrastructure workers with symptoms
Individuals who do not meet any of the above categories with symptoms
Health care workers and first responders
Individuals with mild symptoms in communities experiencing high COVID-19 hospitalizations
Individuals without symptoms
Clinicians should immediately implement recommended infection prevention and control practices if a patient is suspected of having COVID-19. They should also notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their state or local health department if a patient is classified as a PUI for COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a PUI or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a PUI and Case Report form through the processes identified on CDC’s Coronavirus Disease 2019 website. State and local health departments can contact CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on weekends or holidays.
For initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal swab). CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for COVID-19. The induction of sputum is not recommended. For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified, regardless of the time of symptom onset. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 and Biosafety FAQs for handling and processing specimens from suspected cases and PUIs.
2For healthcare personnel, testing may be considered if there has been exposure to a person with suspected COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation. Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable patients in healthcare settings, even mild signs and symptoms (e.g., sore throat) of COVID-19 should be evaluated among potentially exposed healthcare personnel. Additional information is available in CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)
Additional information is available in CDC’s updated Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to healthcare personnel exposed in healthcare settings as described in CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with COVID-19.
4Documentation of laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 may not be possible for travelers or persons caring for COVID-19 patients in other countries.
5Affected areas are defined as geographic regions where sustained community transmission has been identified. For a list of relevant affected areas, see CDC’s Coronavirus Disease 2019 Information for Travel.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
CDC is responding to a pandemic of respiratory disease spreading from person-to-person caused by a novel (new) coronavirus. The disease has been named “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID-19”). This situation poses a serious public health risk. The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this situation. COVID-19 can cause mild to severe illness; most severe illness occurs in older adults.
Different parts of the country are seeing different levels of COVID-19 activity. The United States nationally is in the acceleration phase of the pandemic.  The duration and severity of each pandemic phase can vary depending on the characteristics of the virus and the public health response.
CDC and state and local public health laboratories are testing for the virus that causes COVID-19. View CDC’s Public Health Laboratory Testing map.
All 50 states have reported cases of COVID-19 to CDC.

Everyone can do their part to help us respond to this emerging public health threat:
which is a nationwide effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 through the implementation of social distancing at all levels of society.
Older people and people with severe chronic conditions should take special precautions because they are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
If you are a healthcare provider, use your judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Factors to consider in addition to clinical symptoms may include:
Has the patient been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or with patients with pneumonia of unknown cause?
Does the patient reside in an area where there has been community spread of COVID-19?
If you are a healthcare provider or a public health responder caring for a COVID-19 patient, please take care of yourself and follow recommended infection control procedures.
People who get a fever or cough should consider whether they might have COVID-19, depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures. More than half of the U.S. is seeing some level of community spread of COVID-19. Testing for COVID-19 may be accessed through medical providers or public health departments, but there is no treatment for this virus. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home without medical care. 
For people who are ill with COVID-19, but are not sick enough to be hospitalized, please follow CDC guidance on how to reduce the risk of spreading your illness to others. People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to isolate at home during their illness.
If you have been in China or another affected area or have been exposed to someone sick with COVID-19 in the last 14 days, you will face some limitations on your movement and activity. Please follow instructions during this time. Your cooperation is integral to the ongoing public health response to try to slow spread of this virus.
COVID-19 Emergence
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. Some international destinations now have ongoing community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19, as do some parts of the United States. Community spread means some people have been infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed. Learn more about the spread of this newly emerged coronavirus.
The complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully known. Reported illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a report
out of China suggests serious illness occurs in 16% of cases. Older people and people of all ages with severe chronic medical conditions — like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example — seem to be at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. A CDC Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report that looked at severity of disease among COVID-19 cases in the United States by age group found that 80% of deaths were among adults 65 years and older with the highest percentage of severe outcomes occurring in people 85 years and older.
Learn more about the symptoms associated with COVID-19.
COVID-19 Pandemic
A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease. Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people sustainably. Because there is little to no pre-existing immunity against the new virus, it spreads worldwide.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is infecting people and spreading easily from person-to-person. On March 11, the COVID-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the WHO
This is the first pandemic known to be caused by a new coronavirus. In the past century, there have been four pandemics caused by the emergence of new influenza viruses. As a result, most research and guidance around pandemics is specific to influenza, but the same premises can be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemics of respiratory disease follow a certain progression outlined in a “Pandemic Intervals Framework.” Pandemics begin with an investigation phase, followed by recognition, initiation, and acceleration phases. The peak of illnesses occurs at the end of the acceleration phase, which is followed by a deceleration phase, during which there is a decrease in illnesses. Different countries can be in different phases of the pandemic at any point in time and different parts of the same country can also be in different phases of a pandemic.
Source: CDC’s “Updated Preparedness and Response Framework for Influenza Pandemics.”.
Risk depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people; the severity of resulting illness; and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness) and the relative success of these. In the absence of vaccine or treatment medications, nonpharmaceutical interventions become the most important response strategy. These are community interventions that can reduce the impact of disease.
The risk from COVID-19 to Americans can be broken down into risk of exposure versus risk of serious illness and death.
The immediate risk of being exposed to this virus is still low for most Americans, but as the outbreak expands, that risk will increase. Cases of COVID-19 and instances of community spread are being reported in a growing number of states.
People in places where ongoing community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been reported are at elevated risk of exposure, with the level of risk dependent on the location.
Healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure.
Close contacts of persons with COVID-19 also are at elevated risk of exposure.
Travelers returning from affected international locations where community spread is occurring also are at elevated risk of exposure, with level of risk dependent on where they traveled.
Early information out of China, where COVID-19 first started, shows that some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness. This includes:
People who have serious chronic medical conditions like:
Heart disease
Lung disease
CDC has developed guidance to help in the risk assessment and management of people with potential exposures to COVID-19.
More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the United States in the coming days, including more instances of community spread. CDC expects that widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur. In the coming months, most of the U.S. population will be exposed to this virus.
Widespread transmission of COVID-19 could translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, and workplaces, may experience more absenteeism. Mass gatherings may be sparsely attended or postponed. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and sectors of the transportation industry may also be affected. Healthcare providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it. Nonpharmaceutical interventions will be the most important response strategy to try to delay the spread of the virus and reduce the impact of disease.
Global efforts at this time are focused concurrently on lessening the spread and impact of this virus. The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat.
CDC established a COVID-19 Incident Management System on January 7, 2020. On January 21, CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center to better provide ongoing support to the COVID-19 response.
The U.S. government has taken unprecedented steps with respect to travel in response to the growing public health threat posed by this new coronavirus:
U.S. citizens, residents, and their immediate family members who have been any one of those countries within in the past 14 days can enter the United States, but they are subject to health monitoring and possible quarantine for up to 14 days.
People at higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel.
CDC has issued additional specific travel guidance related to COVID-19.

CDC has deployed multidisciplinary teams to support state health departments in case identification, contact tracing, clinical management, and public communications.
CDC has worked with federal partners to support the safe return of Americans overseas who have been affected by COVID-19.
This is a picture of CDC’s laboratory test kit for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CDC tests are provided to U.S. state and local public health laboratories, Department of Defense (DOD) laboratories and select international laboratories.
An important part of CDC’s role during a public health emergency is to develop a test for the pathogen and equip state and local public health labs with testing capacity.
CDC developed an rRT-PCR test to diagnose COVID-19.
As of the evening of March 17, 89 state and local public health labs in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have successfully verified and are currently using CDC COVID-19 diagnostic tests.
Commercial manufacturers are now producing their own tests.
CDC has grown the COVID-19 virus in cell culture, which is necessary for further studies, including for additional genetic characterization. The cell-grown virus was sent to NIH’s BEI Resources Repository
CDC also is developing a serology test for COVID-19.

If you have a fever or cough, you might have COVID-19. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home. Keep track of your symptoms. If you have an emergency warning sign (including trouble breathing), get medical attention right away.
Steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if you are sick
Follow the steps below:  If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have COVID-19, follow the steps below to care for yourself and to help protect other people in your home and community.
Stay home except to get medical care
Stay home: Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and are able to recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas.
Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.
Separate yourself from other people in your home, this is known as home isolation
See COVID-19 and Animals is you have questions about pets.
Call ahead: Many medical visits for routine care are being postponed or done by phone or telemedicine.
If you have a medical appointment that cannot be postponed, call your doctor’s office, and tell them you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the office protect themselves and other patients.
If you are sick: You should wear a facemask, if available, when you are around other people (including before you enter a healthcare provider’s office).
Note: During a public health emergency, facemasks may be reserved for healthcare workers. You may need to improvise a facemask using a scarf or bandana.
Wash hands: Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
Clean high-touch surfaces in your isolation area (“sick room” and bathroom) every day; let a caregiver clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces in other areas of the home.
Clean and disinfect: Routinely clean high-touch surfaces in your “sick room” and bathroom. Let someone else clean and disinfect surfaces in common areas, but not your bedroom and bathroom.
If a caregiver or other person needs to clean and disinfect a sick person’s bedroom or bathroom, they should do so on an as-needed basis. The caregiver/other person should wear a mask and wait as long as possible after the sick person has used the bathroom.
Clean and disinfect areas that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
Household cleaners and disinfectants: Clean the area or item with soap and water or another detergent if it is dirty. Then, use a household disinfectant.
Most EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A full list of disinfectants can be found here
Complete disinfection guidance
Monitor your symptoms
Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever and cough. Trouble breathing is a more serious symptom that means you should get medical attention.
If you are having trouble breathing, seek medical attention, but call first.
Call your doctor or emergency room before going in and tell them your symptoms. They will tell you what to do.
Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider and local health department: Your local health authorities may give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information.
When to Seek Medical Attention
If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include*:
*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the operator that you have or think you might have, COVID-19. If possible, put on a facemask before medical help arrives.
How to discontinue home isolation
People with COVID-19 who have stayed home (home isolated) can stop home isolation under the following conditions:
other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved)
at least 7 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared
other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved)
you received two negative tests in a row, 24 hours apart. Your doctor will follow CDC guidelines.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department. The decision to stop home isolation should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider and state and local health departments. Local decisions depend on local circumstances.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Most people who get sick with COVID-19 will have only mild illness and should recover at home.* Care at home can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and help protect people who are at risk for getting seriously ill from COVID-19.
COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
If you are caring for someone at home, monitor for emergency signs, prevent the spread of germs, treat symptoms, and carefully consider when to end home isolation.
*Note: Older adults and people of any age with certain serious underlying medical conditions like lung disease, heart disease, or diabetes are at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness and should seek care as soon as symptoms start.
Monitor the person for worsening symptoms. Know the emergency warning signs.
Have their healthcare provider’s contact information on hand.
If they are getting sicker, call their healthcare provider. For medical emergencies, call 911 and notify the dispatch personnel that they have or are suspected to have COVID-19.
If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include*:
*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after interacting with the sick person. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
For any additional questions about their care, contact their healthcare provider or state or local health department.
Make sure the sick person drinks a lot of fluids to stay hydrated and rests at home.
Over-the-counter medicines may help with symptoms.
For most people, symptoms last a few days and get better after a week.
When to end home isolation (staying home)
People with COVID-19 who have stayed home (are home isolated) can stop home isolation under the following conditions:
other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved)
at least 7 days have passed since their symptoms first appeared
other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved)
They received two negative tests in a row, 24 hours apart. Their doctor will follow CDC guidelines.

Enfermedad del Coronavirus 2019 (COVID‑19)
Página principal de la enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
El COVID-19 y los animales
P: ¿Qué es un nuevo coronavirus? 
R: Un nuevo coronavirus (CoV) es un coronavirus que no ha sido identificado con anterioridad. El virus que está causando la enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) no es el mismo que los coronavirus que circulan comúnmente entre los seres humanos y que causan enfermedades leves, como el resfriado común.
Un diagnóstico de coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43 o HKU1 no es lo mismo que un diagnóstico de COVID-19. Son virus diferentes y los pacientes con COVID-19 serán evaluados y atendidos en forma diferente a los pacientes con un diagnóstico de coronavirus comunes.
  P: ¿Por qué a la enfermedad que está causando el brote ahora la llaman enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 o COVID-19?
R: El 11 de febrero del 2020, la Organización Mundial de la Salud anunció el nombre oficial de la enfermedad que está causando el brote del nuevo coronavirus 2019 y que se identificó por primera vez en Wuhan, China. El nuevo nombre de la enfermedad es enfermedad del coronavirus 2019, y se abrevia COVID-19. En el nombre abreviado, “CO” corresponde a “corona”, “VI” a “virus” y “D” a “disease” (“enfermedad”). Antes, la forma de referirse a esta enfermedad era “nuevo coronavirus 2019” o “2019-nCoV”.
Hay muchos tipos de coronavirus humanos, que incluyen algunos que comúnmente causan enfermedades leves de las vías respiratorias superiores. El COVID-19 es una nueva enfermedad, causada por un nuevo coronavirus que no se había visto antes en seres humanos. El nombre de la enfermedad se escogió siguiendo las mejores prácticas
  P: ¿Cómo se llama el virus que está causando el brote de la enfermedad de coronavirus que comenzó en el 2019?
El 11 de febrero del 2020, el Comité Internacional de Taxonomía de Virus, encargado de asignar nombres a los nuevos virus, le dio al nuevo coronavirus (identificado por primera vez en Wuhan, China) el nombre de coronavirus 2 del síndrome respiratorio agudo grave, cuya versión acortada es SARS-CoV-2.
Como lo indica su nombre, el virus está relacionado con el coronavirus asociado al SARS (SARS-CoV) que causó un brote de síndrome respiratorio agudo grave (SARS o SRAG) en el 2002-2003; sin embargo, no es el mismo virus.
  P: ¿Cuál es la fuente del COVID-19?
R: Funcionarios y socios de salud pública están trabajando arduamente para identificar la fuente animal original del virus que causa el COVID-19. Los coronavirus son una familia grande de virus, entre los cuales hay algunos que causan enfermedad en las personas, y otros que circulan entre animales, como camellos, gatos y murciélagos. El análisis del árbol genético de este virus indica que se originó en murciélagos, pero todavía no se sabe si el virus saltó directamente desde murciélagos o hubo un animal hospedador intermedio. El SARS-CoV, otro coronavirus que al surgir infectó a personas, provino de civetas (gatos almizcleros), mientras que el MERS-CoV (coronavirus del síndrome respiratorio de Oriente Medio), que también surgió e infectó a personas, tuvo su origen en camellos. Se puede encontrar más información sobre la fuente y la propagación de este nuevo coronavirus en el Resumen de la situación con relación al COVID-19: Fuente y propagación del virus.
  P: ¿Cómo se propaga el virus?
R: Parece que el nuevo coronavirus se está propagando de persona a persona. Infórmese sobre lo que se sabe acerca de la propagación del COVID-19.
  P: ¿Puede alguien que haya tenido el COVID-19 propagarlo a los demás?
R: El virus que causa el COVID-19 se está propagando de persona a persona. Una persona que esté enferma y mostrando síntomas de COVID-19 puede propagar la enfermedad a los demás. Por esa razón, los CDC recomiendan que estos pacientes sean aislados en el hospital o en casa (dependiendo de cuán enfermos estén) hasta que estén mejor y ya no representen un riesgo de infección para las otras personas.
  P: ¿Puede una persona que haya estado en cuarentena por el COVID-19 propagarlo a los demás?
R: Cuarentena significa separar a una persona o grupo de personas que han estado expuestas a una enfermedad contagiosa, pero que no han presentado la enfermedad (síntomas), de otras personas que no han estado expuestas con el fin de prevenir la posible propagación de esa enfermedad. La cuarentena generalmente se establece para el periodo de incubación de la enfermedad transmisible, que es durante el tiempo en que las personas han contraído la enfermedad después de la exposición. En el caso del COVID-19, el periodo de cuarentena es de 14 días desde la última fecha de exposición, ya que 14 días es el periodo más largo de incubación que se ha observado en coronavirus similares. Se considera que la persona a quien se permitió salir de la cuarentena por el COVID-19 no representa un riesgo de propagación del virus a los demás porque durante el periodo de incubación no contrajo la enfermedad.
  P: ¿Es el SARS-CoV-2 (el virus que causa el COVID-19) el mismo virus que el MERS-CoV o que el virus del SARS )?
R: No. Los coronavirus son una familia grande de virus, entre los cuales hay algunos que causan enfermedad en las personas y otros que circulan entre animales, como camellos, gatos y murciélagos. El SARS-CoV-2 que surgió recientemente no es el mismo coronavirus que causa el síndrome respiratorio de Oriente Medio (MERS), o que el coronavirus que causa el síndrome respiratorio agudo grave (SARS). Los análisis genéticos parecen indicar que el SARS-CoV-2 está relacionado con el SARS-CoV asociado a un brote de enfermedades respiratorias en personas en el 2002-2003…
R: Visite la página sobre Prevención y tratamiento del COVID-19 para informarse más acerca de cómo protegerse contra las enfermedades respiratorias, como el COVID-19.
  P: ¿Qué debo hacer si estuve en contacto cercano con alguien que tiene el COVID-19?
R: Hay información en línea para las personas que han tenido contacto cercano con alguien a quien se le haya confirmado el COVID-19 o a quien se esté evaluando para determinar si lo tiene.
  P: ¿Los CDC recomiendan el uso de mascarillas en la comunidad a fin de prevenir el COVID-19?
R: En la actualidad, los CDC no están haciendo recomendaciones para que las personas que no están enfermas usen mascarillas para protegerse de enfermedades respiratorias, incluso del COVID-19. Usted solo debe usar una mascarilla si un profesional de atención médica se lo recomienda. Las personas que tengan el COVID-19 y muestren síntomas deben usar una mascarilla. Esto es para proteger a los demás del riesgo de infectarse. El uso de mascarillas también es crucial para los trabajadores de la salud y otras personas que estén cuidando, en entornos cerrados, a alguien que tenga el COVID-19 (en casa o en centros de atención médica).
P: ¿Cuáles son los síntomas y las complicaciones que el COVID-19 puede causar?
R: Los síntomas actuales reportados por los pacientes con COVID-19 incluyen una enfermedad respiratoria, de leve a grave, con fiebre1, tos y dificultad para respirar. Lea sobre los síntomas del COVID-19.
  P: ¿Debería hacerme una prueba de detección del COVID-19?
R: No todos deben hacerse la prueba de detección del COVID-19. Para obtener información sobre las pruebas, consulta la página web Prueba de detección del COVID-19.
  P: ¿Dónde puedo hacerme la prueba de detección del COVID-19?
R: El procedimiento y los lugares donde se hacen pruebas varían según el estado. Comunícate con tu departamento estatal, local, tribal o territorial para obtener más información, o consulta a tu proveedor médico. Los departamentos de salud estatales y locales han recibido pruebas de los CDC, mientras que los proveedores médicos están recibiendo pruebas elaboradas por fabricantes comerciales. Aunque el suministro de estas pruebas está aumentando, aún puede ser difícil encontrar un lugar donde hacerte la prueba. Consulta la página web Prueba de detección del COVID-19 para obtener más información.
  P: ¿Cómo se le hace a una persona una prueba de detección del COVID-19?
R: En estos momentos, las pruebas de diagnóstico para el COVID-19 solo se pueden realizar en los CDC.
Los departamentos de salud estatales y locales que hayan identificado a una persona bajo investigación (PUI, por sus siglas en inglés) deben notificar inmediatamente al Centro de Operaciones de Emergencia de los CDC (EOC) para informar sobre esa persona y determinar si corresponde hacerle una prueba de detección del COVID-19 en los CDC. El EOC asistirá a los departamentos de salud locales y estatales para recolectar, almacenar y enviar muestras adecuadamente a los CDC, incluso fuera del horario de funcionamiento o durante los fines de semana o feriados.
R: Cuando se usa la prueba de diagnóstico elaborada por los CDC, un resultado negativo significa que en la muestra de la persona no se encontró el virus que causa el COVID-19. En las primeras etapas de la infección, es posible que el virus no se detecte.
En el caso del COVID-19, un resultado negativo —en la prueba con la muestra recolectada mientras el paciente tenía síntomas— probablemente significa que el virus del COVID-19 no le está causando la enfermedad actual.
R: Para obtener las recomendaciones y directrices para pacientes bajo investigación; control de infecciones, que incluye directrices para el equipo de protección personal; atención en el hogar y aislamiento; e investigación de casos, vea la Información para profesionales de atención médica. Para ver información sobre la recolección y el envío de muestras, consulte la Información para laboratorios. Para obtener información para los profesionales de salud pública acerca del COVID-19, vea la página de Información para profesionales de salud pública.
En línea, se pueden encontrar preguntas frecuentes adicionales acerca del COVID-19, y sus respuestas, para profesionales de atención médica.
P: ¿Qué están haciendo los CDC con relación al COVID-19?
R: Esta es una situación emergente que está cambiando rápidamente y los CDC continuarán brindando información actualizada a medida que esté disponible. Los CDC trabajan a toda hora para proteger la salud de las personas. En línea, hay más información sobre la respuesta de los CDC al COVID-19.
  P: ¿Estoy en riesgo de contraer el COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos?
R: Esta es una situación que está cambiando rápidamente y la evaluación de riesgos podría cambiar a diario. Las últimas actualizaciones están disponibles en el sitio web de los CDC sobre la enfermedad de coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
R: Sí. El primer caso de COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos se notificó el 21 de enero del 2020. El primer caso confirmado de propagación de este virus de persona a persona en los EE. UU. se notificó el 30 de enero del 2020. Vea la cantidad actual de casos de COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos.
  P: ¿Estoy en riesgo de contraer el COVID-19 a través de paquetes o productos que se envíen de China?
Todavía hay mucho que se desconoce acerca del COVID-19 que acaba de surgir y sobre cómo se propaga. Hay otros dos virus que surgieron con anterioridad y causaron enfermedades graves a personas (MERS-CoV y SARS-CoV). El virus que causa el COVID-19 está genéticamente más relacionado con el SARS-CoV que con el MERS-CoV, pero ambos son betacoronavirus que se originan en murciélagos. Aunque no sabemos con seguridad si este virus actuará de la misma forma que el SARS-CoV y el MERS-CoV, podemos usar la información obtenida de estos dos coronavirus anteriores para orientarnos. Por lo general, debido a la poca capacidad de supervivencia de estos coronavirus en superficies, es probable que haya un riesgo muy bajo de propagación a través de los productos o envases que son transportados por periodos que duran varios días o semanas a temperatura ambiente. Generalmente se cree que los coronavirus se transmiten con más frecuencia a través de gotitas respiratorias. Actualmente no hay evidencia que respalde la transmisión del COVID-19 asociada a productos importados, y en los EE. UU. no ha habido ningún caso de COVID-19 asociado a productos importados. Se proporcionará información en el sitio web sobre el nuevo coronavirus 2019 a medida que esté disponible.
  P: ¿El tiempo cálido detendrá el brote de COVID-19?
R: Aún se desconoce si el tiempo y la temperatura afectarán la propagación del COVID-19. Algunos otros virus, como los del resfriado común o de la influenza (gripe), se propagan más durante los meses fríos, pero eso no significa que es imposible enfermarse a causa de uno de esos virus durante otros meses. En estos momentos, no se sabe si la propagación del COVID-19 se reducirá cuando el tiempo se ponga más cálido. Hay mucho más que aprender acerca de la transmisibilidad, gravedad y otras características asociadas al COVID-19 y las investigaciones están en curso.
P: ¿Es seguro viajar a China o a otros países donde se han producido casos del nuevo coronavirus 2019-nCoV?
Lavarse las manos frecuentemente con agua y jabón por al menos 20 segundos para evitar la propagación de virus a los demás.
Lavarse las manos con agua y jabón inmediatamente después de toser, estornudar o sonarse la nariz. Si no hay agua y jabón fácilmente disponibles, puede usar un desinfectante de manos que contenga al menos un 60 % de alcohol. Lávese las manos siempre con agua y jabón si están visiblemente sucias.
El COVID-19 y los animales
Los CDC no tienen ninguna evidencia que indique que los animales o los productos animales importados de China representen un riesgo de propagación del COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos. Esta situación está cambiando rápidamente y la información se actualizará a medida que esté disponible. Los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de los EE. UU. (CDC), el Departamento de Agricultura de los EE. UU. (USDA) y el Servicio Federal de Pesca y Vida Silvestre de los EE. UU. (FWS) cumplen funciones diferentes, pero complementarias, en la reglamentación de la importación de animales vivos y productos animales a los Estados Unidos. Los CDC regulan los animales y productos animales que representan una amenaza para la salud humana, el USDA regula
  P: ¿Puedo viajar a los Estados Unidos con perros o importar perros a este país durante el brote de COVID-19?
  P: ¿Debería preocuparme acerca de las mascotas u otros animales y el COVID-19?
Si bien el virus parece haber surgido de una fuente animal, ahora se está transmitiendo de persona a persona. No hay motivos para pensar que algún animal o mascota en los Estados Unidos podría ser una fuente de infección por este nuevo coronavirus.
Mientras esté enfermo, no manipule o toque mascotas ni otros animales. Aunque no ha habido informes de que mascotas u otros animales se hayan enfermado a causa del COVID-19, varios tipos de coronavirus pueden causar enfermedades en animales y propagarlas entre animales y personas. Hasta que sepamos más, evite el contacto con animales y use una mascarilla si debe estar cerca de ellos o cuidar a una mascota.
estar dentro de aproximadamente 6 pies (2 metros) de un caso de COVID-19 durante un periodo prolongado; el contacto cercano puede ocurrir mientras se le brindan cuidados a un caso de COVID-19, o al vivir con este, visitarlo o compartir una habitación, sala o área de espera con él.
tener contacto directo con las secreciones infecciosas de un caso de COVID-19 (p. ej., si le tose encima).
Consulte las recomendaciones provisionales sobre la prevención y el control de infecciones asociadas a la atención médica para pacientes bajo investigación por el nuevo coronavirus 2019.
Los datos que fundamentan la definición de contacto cercano son limitados. Al evaluar los contactos cercanos, las consideraciones incluyen la duración de la exposición (p. ej., es probable que un mayor tiempo de exposición aumente el riesgo de exposición) y los síntomas clínicos de la persona con COVID-19 (p. ej., es probable que la tos aumente el riesgo de exposición, así como lo hace la exposición a un paciente gravemente enfermo). Se debe dar consideración especial a las personas expuestas en los entornos de atención médica.

This interim guidance is to help household members plan for community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages household members to prepare for the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak in their community.
Information for travelers returning from countries with level 3 travel health notices. Depending on your travel history, you will be asked to stay home for a period of 14 days from the time you left an area with widespread or ongoing community spread (Level 3 Travel Health Notice).
CDC recommends that all people defer travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, worldwide. That’s because the risk of COVID-19 on cruise ships is high. Older adults and people with serious chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease, should especially defer travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, because of their increased risk for severe disease.

a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)
See CDC’s updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.

Interim Guidance for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travelers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities. Examples of large events and mass gatherings include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings, and other types of assemblies. These events can be planned not only by organizations and communities but also by individuals.
Follow-up After a COVID-19 Outbreak has Ended
Adds standard language regarding disinfection procedures
This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this interim guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available.
This interim guidance is intended for organizers and staff responsible for planning mass gatherings or large community events in the United States. A mass gathering is a planned or spontaneous event with a large number of people in attendance that could strain the planning and response resources of the community hosting the event, such as a concert, festival, conference, or sporting event. Guidance specific to schools and childcare settings, institutions of higher education, and community- and faith-based organizations can be found on CDC’s website focused on prevention COVID-19 spread in communities.
COVID-19 is an emerging respiratory disease and there is more to learn about its transmission, clinical course, and populations at increased risk of disease and complications (see How COVID-19 Spreads). Everyone can do their part to help plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat.
Older adults and persons with severe underlying health conditions are considered to be at increased risk of more serious illness after contracting COVID-19.  Priority should be given to ensuring the safety of these groups of people, particularly for any mass gatherings that are expected to have a large number of older adults or persons with underlying conditions.
As the COVID-19 outbreak evolves, CDC strongly encourages event organizers and staff to prepare for the possibility of outbreaks in their communities. Creating an emergency plan for mass gatherings and large community events can help protect you and the health of your event participants and the local community.
CDC has developed recommended actions for preventing the spread of COVID-19 at mass gatherings and large community events. This guidance suggests strategies to help you plan for and implement ways in which to better protect all involved in a mass gathering.
The overall number of attendees. Larger gatherings (for example, more than 250 people) offer more opportunities for person-to-person contact and therefore pose greater risk of COVID-19 transmission.
The number of people attending who are at greater risk of more serious illness after contracting COVID-19. Older adults and persons with severe pre-existing health conditions are thought to be at increased risk.
The density of attendees within a confined area. Based on what is currently known about the virus, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within 6 feet).
The level of transmission in your local community and the level of transmission in the areas from which your attendees will travel. To better understand the level of community transmission in your community (and in the communities from which your attendees will be traveling), consult with your local and/or state public health department.
The details of your emergency operations plan should be based on the size and duration of your events, demographics of the participants, complexity of your event operations, and type of on-site services and activities your event may offer.
 Review the existing emergency operations plans for your venues
Meet with the emergency operations coordinator or planning team at your venues. Discuss the emergency operations plans and determine how they may impact aspects of your events, such as personnel, security, services and activities, functions, and resources. Work with the emergency operations coordinator or planning team to prepare for the key prevention strategies outlined in this guidance. Develop a contingency plan that addresses various scenarios described below which you may encounter during a COVID-19 outbreak.
Establish relationships with key community partners and stakeholders. When forming key relationships for your events, include relevant partners such as the local public health department, community leaders, faith-based organizations, vendors, suppliers, hospitals, hotels, airlines, transportation companies, and law enforcement. Collaborate and coordinate with them on broader planning efforts. Clearly identify each partner’s role, responsibilities, and decision-making authority. Contact your local public health department for a copy of their outbreak response and mitigation plan for your community. Participate in community-wide emergency preparedness activities.
Address key prevention strategies in your emergency operations plan
Promote the daily practice of everyday preventive actions. Use health messages and materials developed by credible public health sources such as CDC or your local public health department to encourage your event staff and participants to practice good personal health habits. Consider displaying signs (physical and/or electronic) throughout the event to provide frequent reminders to participants to engage in everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These include:
Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Handshakes and “high-fives” are often exchanged at meetings and sporting events, and these can be ways in which COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person. As a way of decreasing the social pressure to engage in these common behaviors, consider displaying signs (physical and/or electronic) that discourage these actions during the gathering.
Provide COVID-19 prevention supplies to event staff and participants. Ensure that your events have supplies for event staff and participants, such as hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, tissues, trash baskets, disposable facemasks, and cleaners and disinfectants. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects with detergent and water prior to disinfection, especially surfaces that are visibly dirty.
Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched. Clean with the cleaners typically used. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label.
For disinfection most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.
A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here
. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Additionally, diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:
Additional information on cleaning and disinfection of community facilities can be found on CDC’s website.
Plan for staff absences. Develop and implement flexible attendance and sick-leave policies. Event staff need to stay home when they are sick, or they may need to stay home to care for a sick household member or care for their children in the event of school dismissals. Allow staff to work from home when possible. Identify critical job functions and positions and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff (similar to planning for holiday staffing). Provide instructions about how and when to safely return to work.
Implement ﬂexible staff attendance and sick-leave policies (if possible). Require staff to stay home if they are sick or caring for a sick household member. Notify staff when you plan to implement COVID-19 leave policies.
Note: Direct staff who get sick with COVID-19 symptoms to avoid contact with others and to seek medical advice.
Consider alternatives for event staff and participants who are at increased risk for complications from COVID-19. Currently, older adults and persons with severe underlying health conditions are considered to be at increased risk for severe illness and complications from COVID-19. Event organizers can consider reassigning duties for higher-risk staff to have minimal contact with other persons. People in higher-risk groups should consult with their healthcare provider about attending large events. Consider providing refunds to event participants who are unable to attend because they are at high risk and/or provide information on alternative viewing options.
Promote messages that discourage people who are sick from attending events. This could include electronic messages sent to attendees prior to travel to the event as well as messages requesting that people leave events if they begin to have symptoms of COVID-19, which include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Attendees should be encouraged to seek medical advice promptly by calling ahead to a doctor’s office or emergency room to get guidance. See CDC guidance on what to do when sick with COVID-19.
If possible, identify a space that can be used to isolate staff or participants who become ill at the event. Designate a space for staff and participants who may become sick and cannot leave the event immediately. Work with partners, such as local hospitals, to create a plan for treating staff and participants who do not live nearby. Include a plan for separating and caring for vulnerable populations. If any staff member or participant becomes sick at your event, separate them from others as soon as possible. Establish procedures to help sick staff or participants leave the event as soon as possible. Provide them with clean, disposable facemasks
to wear, if available. Work with the local public health department and nearby hospitals to care for those who become sick. If needed, contact emergency services for those who need emergency care. Public transportation, shared rides, and taxis should be avoided for sick persons, and disposable facemasks should be worn by persons who are sick at all times when in a vehicle. Read more about preventing the spread of COVID-19 if someone is sick.
  Note: Providing a sick staff member or event participant with a disposable facemask to wear does not replace the need for that person to leave as soon as possible, stay home, and seek medical advice. Wearing a disposable facemask in the workplace or while participating in a large event is not a sufficient infection control measure.
Develop ﬂexible refund policies for participants. Create refund policies that permit participants the flexibility to stay home when they are sick, need to care for sick household members, or are at high risk for complications from COVID-19.
Identify actions to take if you need to postpone or cancel events. Work closely with local public health officials to assess local capacities in the area. During a COVID-19 outbreak, resource limitations among local healthcare systems and/or law enforcement can influence the decision to postpone or cancel your events. If possible, plan alternative ways for participants to enjoy the events by television, radio, or online.
Communicate about COVID-19
Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Get up-to-date information about local COVID-19 activity from public health officials. Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area because these may affect event staff.
  Note: Early in the outbreak, local public health officials may recommend schools dismiss temporarily.
Update and distribute timely and accurate emergency communication information. Identify everyone in your chain of communication (for example, event staff, participants, suppliers, vendors, and key community partners and stakeholders) and establish systems for sharing information with them. Maintain up-to-date contact information for everyone in the chain of communication. Identify platforms, such as a hotline, automated text messaging, and a website to help disseminate information. Update key community partners and stakeholders regularly. Share information about how you and the emergency operations coordinator or planning team for the venues are responding to the outbreak.
Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to event staff and participants. Information you share should be easily understood by everyone attending the events. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures by visiting: Know Your Audience. You also can learn more about communicating to staff in a crisis at: Crisis Communications Plan
Follow-up After a COVID-19 Outbreak has Ended
Remember, a COVID-19 outbreak could last for a long time. When public health officials determine that the outbreak has ended in your local community, work with them to identify criteria for scaling back COVID-19 prevention actions at your events. Base the criteria on slowing of the outbreak in your local area. If your events were cancelled, work with your venues to reschedule your events.
Evaluate the effectiveness of your emergency operations and communication plans
Meet with the emergency operations coordinator or planning team for your venues to discuss and note lessons learned. Gather feedback from event staff, participants (if possible), community partners, and stakeholders to improve plans. Identify any gaps in the plans and any needs you may have for additional resources.
Maintain and expand your planning team. Look for ways to expand community partnerships. Identify agencies or partners needed to help you prepare for infectious disease outbreaks in the future and try to add them to your planning team.
Participate in community-wide emergency preparedness activities.

Community- and faith-based organizations (CFBOs), working together with schools, businesses, healthcare systems, and state, local, tribal, and territorial health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of diseases, especially among high risk populations.
Guidance is also provided for what to do when a person who is a confirmed COVID-19 case has been in your facility, regardless of the level of community transmission.
All decisions about implementing these strategies (e.g., alteration or reduction of services, event cancellations, other social distancing measures) should be made locally, in collaboration with local health officials who can help determine the level of transmission in the community. Information about level of transmission is available in CDC’s framework for mitigation
This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the following CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance.
Health officials are working to prevent COVID-19 from entering and spreading in US communities. CFBOs play an important role in this effort. In coordination with local health departments, CFBOs can share information about the disease, how it spreads, and who is at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. CFBOs should take steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 when needed.
CFBOs should review, update, or develop and implement emergency plans for the organization, with special consideration for individuals at increased risk of severe illness. Organizational emergency plans should complement other community mitigation strategies to protect high risk populations, avoid overwhelming the healthcare system, minimize disruption to essential services, and protect individuals from social stigma and discrimination. Plans should build on everyday practices (e.g., encouraging healthy hygiene practices, cleaning frequently touched surfaces, communicating clearly and regularly). Strategies should be based on whether a confirmed COVID-19 case has been in your facility, the level of community transmission, characteristics of the community, and the local capacity to implement strategies.
This guidance is intended to help CFBOs prevent the transmission of COVID-19 within their facilities and communities. CFBOs need to be able to react quickly if there is a confirmed COVID-19 case among staff, volunteers, the people they serve, or visitors. The guidance includes considerations to help administrators and leaders plan for the continuity of services depending on level of community spread of COVID-19.
What is the role of CFBOs in responding to COVID-19?
CFBOs, working together with schools, businesses, healthcare systems and state/territorial and local (and, if applicable, tribal) health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of diseases, especially among high risk populations. It is important to realize that government, communities, and individuals must work together to prepare for and respond to COVID-19. A CFBO is one part of a community, local, regional, and national collaborative effort. CFBOs often serve those who are most vulnerable, such as older people and those with serious underlying health conditions – like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes – who are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness. This may include members and regular attendees or people they serve as well as persons from the broader community.
How should CFBOs prepare for, and respond to, COVID-19?
CFBOs should be prepared for situations when there is local community transmission of COVID-19 and when a confirmed COVID-19 case has been in the facility, regardless of level of community transmission. The following diagram summarizes mitigation strategies that may be most appropriate for these situations.
The most important thing to do before community transmission occurs is plan and prepare. CFBO administrators and leaders should reinforce healthy hygiene practices among their staff, volunteers, members, the people they serve, and visitors. As the global outbreak evolves, CFBOs should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks. CFBOs need to be ready if, and when, COVID-19 appears in their communities. Here are some strategies:
Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOP). This should be done in collaboration with local health departments
and other relevant partners. Many CFBOs already have an EOP designed for a wide range or emergencies (e.g., natural disasters, fires). Focus on the components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks.
Outline what the organizational structure will be during an emergency; review periodically, and revise as needed. Identify key contacts (including full-time, part-time and unpaid or volunteer staff) needed to carry out your organization’s work, with multiple back-ups. Define role and responsibilities and who is supposed to report to whom.
Understand the roles of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial public health agencies and emergency responders and what guidance and assistance they can provide.
Assign a point of contact to maximize communication between your organization and your state and local public health systems.
Find out if your local government has a private-public emergency planning group. Build strong alliances with other community leaders, faith leaders, local businesses, schools, and other partners before local community transmission. Your input will help ensure the completeness and representativeness of your local government’s emergency operations plan.
Identify and meet with these potential partners to learn about their planning and to educate them about the CFBOs’ plans and capabilities. Many hospital and healthcare systems, law enforcement and emergency responder organizations, schools, and businesses are also actively preparing for and/or responding to COVID-19. For example, hospitals are planning for potential large numbers of people who become very ill simultaneously and businesses are planning for how to continue operating during an emergency. However, many of these groups may be unaware that a CFBO could offer valuable resources to its communities during the COVID-19 response.
Partner with congregations or organizations within existing associations, networks or denominations, and neighborhoods. Methods for collaborative efforts—such as large organizations supporting smaller ones or several smaller organizations working together—need to be developed to keep organizations running during an emergency. State, local, tribal, or territorial government will be able to help CFBOs coordinate with other national and local efforts.
Update the emergency communication plan for distributing timely and accurate information.
Designate an experienced person or persons who can take calls. Ask persons who might normally respond to calls for your organization to volunteer during an emergency, to facilitate the best use of their skills and experience.
Develop information-sharing systems with partners, including local health officials.
Ensure the EOP includes mitigation strategies such as social distancing; altering, reducing, or suspending services; and facility closure that may be used to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19. The plan should include strategies for continuity of all essential services in the event of facility closure or other community-wide mitigation strategies.
Identify services and activities (e.g. religious worship services, meetings, and classes) that might need to be limited or temporarily discontinued during an outbreak. Find alternative solutions that will ensure continuity for the people you serve, especially vulnerable populations such as older adults, persons with underlying health conditions, and persons with disabilities.
Identify ways to address social, emotional, spiritual, physical, and safety needs that may be impacted by community mitigation strategies.
Ensure the EOP emphasizes everyday preventive actions. These include, for example, avoiding close contact with people who are sick; staying home when sick, except to get medical care; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often.
Religious leaders should decide whether to modify specific religious rites, rituals, and services, consulting with local health officials as needed. Examples of specific preventive actions include:
Ensuring that religious leaders always wash their hands or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol prior to conducting the service and Communion.
Teach and reinforce healthy hygiene practices.
Train staff and volunteers on healthy hygiene practices.
Communicate the importance of healthy hygiene practices with members and visitors.
Ensure handwashing strategies include washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include health promotion materials, information on proper handwashing technique, and tips for families to help children develop good handwashing habits. Consider hanging signs in bathrooms as an extra reminder.
Ensure adequate supplies (e.g., soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer, tissue) to support healthy hygiene practices.
Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts.
Routinely (at least once per day, if possible) clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched. This may include cleaning objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops). Clean with the cleaners typically used. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label. For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here
. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Ensure adequate cleaning and disinfection supplies.
Alert local health officials about large increases in absenteeism, particularly if absences appear due to respiratory illnesses (like the common cold or the “flu,” which have symptoms similar to COVID-19).

, if possible. Note: Disposable facemasks are for persons with respiratory symptoms. A person who becomes sick should be given a clean disposable facemask to wear until they can safely leave and/or seek medical care.
If needed, arrange transportation for persons who need medical care.
Notify the transporter and the receiving healthcare facility that the person has signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 so that appropriate infection control precautions may be taken.
Remember that non-healthcare CFBOs are not expected to screen persons to identify potential cases of COVID-19. If a community (or more specifically, a CFBO) has cases of COVID-19, local health officials will help identify those persons and will follow up on next steps.
For organizations that assist with or oversee homeless shelters or similar facilities, review COVID-19-related guidance for homeless shelters for additional planning considerations.
Consult with local health officials to ensure dissemination of accurate and timely information.
Reiterate steps individuals can take to stay healthy and guidance that they should stay home if sick. Address the concerns of staff, volunteers, members, and the people you serve who are at higher risk for COVID-19 complications.

When a person who is a confirmed COVID-19 case has been in the facility, regardless of community transmission
Any CFBO should be prepared to close temporarily, regardless of whether there is community transmission, if a person who is a confirmed COVID-19 case has been in the facility. If this happens, CDC recommends the following procedures:
Coordinate with local health officials. Once learning of a person with confirmed COVID-19 who has been in the facility, immediately notify local health officials. These officials will have guidance for administrators and leaders to determine a course of action, which may include tracing contacts of that person.
Local health officials can offer guidance for closing the facility or restricting access (who can enter or what areas of the facility can be accessed). An initial short-term closure may be recommended to allow time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation.
During this time, make decisions in consultation with local health officials as to whether group activities that would have been held in the facility should be moved to alternate locations.
Clean and disinfect thoroughly.
It is recommended to close off areas used by the ill persons and wait as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection to minimize potential for exposure to respiratory droplets. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area. If possible, wait up to 24 hours before beginning cleaning and disinfection.
Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas (e.g., offices, bathrooms, and common areas) used by the ill persons, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces.
Follow Interim Guidance for US Institutions of Higher Education on working with state and local health officials to isolate ill persons and provide temporary housing as needed.
It is recommended to close off areas used by the ill persons and wait as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection to minimize potential for exposure to respiratory droplets. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area. If possible, wait up to 24 hours before beginning cleaning and disinfection.
In areas where ill persons are being housed in isolation, follow Interim Guidance for Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection for U.S. Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019. This includes focusing on cleaning and disinfecting common areas where staff/others providing services may come into contact with ill persons, but reducing cleaning and disinfection of bedrooms/bathrooms used by ill persons to as needed.
In areas where ill persons have visited or used, continue routine cleaning and disinfection as in this guidance.
Follow recommended precautions for caregivers (i.e., outreach workers and others who visit persons with COVID-19 symptoms) in a nonhealthcare setting: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html#precautions
Consider working with the local health department, a local hospital, healthcare agency, or service organization, such as the American Red Cross, to provide infection control training to caregivers who will serve your members or clients.
Communicate with staff, volunteers, members, and the people you serve. Coordinate with local health officials to communicate closure decisions, alterations to services, and the possible COVID-19 exposure. CFBOs play a vital role in maintaining community morale and cohesion, especially if large gatherings and other community assemblies are cancelled. People will need to be able to receive timely, reliable information from their religious and community leaders.
In such a circumstance, it is critical to maintain confidentiality of the person who is a confirmed COVID-19 case.
Address the concerns of staff, volunteers, members, and the people you serve who are at higher risk for COVID-19 complications.
Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to the community you serve. Examples of communications resources include reaching people of diverse languages and cultures and communicating to workers in a crisis
Make decisions in consultation with local health officials about extending the closure of, or limited access to, the facility. This is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities.
CFBO administrators and leaders should work in close collaboration with local health officials to make these decisions after gaining a better understanding of the situation related to a person who is a confirmed COVID-19 case having been in your facility.
If the facility opens or opens in a limited manner, follow the recommended strategies in this guidance specific to the level of COVID-19 transmission occurring in the community.
Be prepared for the scope of recommended mitigation strategies to change as the local situation evolves.
Staff and volunteers who are sick or who are well but are taking care of, or share a home with, a person who is a confirmed COVID-19 case should follow instructions from local health officials to determine when to return to the facility.
If local health officials report that there is a minimal to moderate level of COVID-19 transmission in the community, CFBOs need to implement additional strategies in response to prevent spread. These additional strategies include:
Coordinate with local health officials. This should be a first step in making decisions about responses to the presence of COVID-19 in the community. Health officials can help a CFBO determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for the organization’s situation.
Continue using strategies from the preparedness phase (when there was no community transmission). Implement the emergency operations plan, scaling mitigation strategies up or down depending on the evolving local situation. Be aware of school dismissals and other community-wide mitigation strategies in your area because these may affect your staff and volunteers as well as the needs of members and the people you serve.
Implement multiple social distancing strategies. Select strategies based on feasibility given the unique space and needs of the organization. Not all strategies will be appropriate or feasible for all organizations. Administrators and leaders are encouraged to think creatively about all opportunities to increase the physical space between individuals and limit interactions in large group settings. Consider ways to accommodate the needs of individuals at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 in all strategies.

Local health officials can inform decisions, which should be based on directions of state and local authorities as well as level of community transmission or impact of COVID-19, size of the gathering, and participation by high risk populations
Modify all gatherings to incorporate social distancing measures.
Religious leaders should discuss with members the potential postponement of large events, such as celebrations (e.g., weddings, bar or bat mitzvahs, and baptisms), funerals, and holiday gatherings – or limiting to a small number of family and friends, ensuring protection of vulnerable populations, hand hygiene, and social distancing.
Modifications to gatherings for social distancing might include:
Postpone or cancel trips that could expose staff, volunteers, members, or the people you serve to potential community spread of COVID-19. Persons returning from travel to areas with community spread of COVID-19 must follow guidance they have received from health officials.
Minimize face-to-face interactions with people with respiratory symptoms. Use physical barriers to protect staff who interact with the people you serve. For example, install a sneeze guard at the check-in desk or place an additional table between staff and the people you serve to increase the distance between them.
Increase the space between staff members’ desks. Rearrange desks to maximize the space between staff members. If in the same room, seat staff to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other) to reduce transmission caused from virus-containing droplets from talking, coughing, or sneezing.
Get to know which staff, volunteers, members, people you serve, and neighbors might need extra assistance due to social isolation and economic hardships if staying at home for an extended period.
Persons with COVID-19 and their household members who need to stay at home for an extended period will need basic necessities (e.g., food and household essentials).
Help neighbors, staff, volunteers, members, and the people you serve keep up-to-date lists of medical conditions and medications, and periodically check their supply of regular prescription and over-the-counter drugs to make sure they will have a sufficient supply.
Encourage people, especially those at higher risk of severe illness, who live alone to seek out a “buddy” who will check on and help care for them if they get sick or are staying at home during an outbreak.
Coordinate with local health officials on ways to ensure care and services for special populations. Congregations and organizations with experience working with underserved communities (e.g., inmates of prisons and jails; homeless persons; immigrants; refugees; those with limited English proficiency; single-parent families; public housing residents; migrant-, farm-, and other low-wage workers) can work with local health officials to ensure these groups receive appropriate care and services.
Follow recommended precautions for caregivers (i.e., outreach workers and others who visit persons with COVID-19 symptoms) in a nonhealthcare setting: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html#precautions
Consider working with the local health department, a local hospital, healthcare agency, or service organization, such as the American Red Cross, to provide infection control training to caregivers who will serve your members or clients.
Consider focusing your organization’s efforts to provide services that are most needed during the emergency, such as mental health, spiritual health, or social services.
Continue to coordinate with local health officials. If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they can provide guidance on the best course of action for CFBOs. Local public health officials will also provide recommendations for phasing out and ending COVID-19 community mitigation actions at the appropriate time.
Consult with local health officials to determine when gatherings of any size can resume.
If the facility is open, determine which other mitigation strategies (of those recommended to be implemented when there is no transmission or minimal to moderate transmission) need to be scaled up and/or extended.
Consider extended closure of the facility or limited access for non-essential services. This longer-term strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community, particularly when implemented in coordination with other closures in the community. Remember to implement strategies to ensure continuity of services to the extent possible, while also addressing increased social, emotional, spiritual, physical, and safety needs (e.g., meal programs, spiritual and social support), particularly for groups that may be more highly impacted.
Determine whether your organization can work with local health departments so that your facilities can be used as temporary care facilities; quarantine facilities; or central distribution sites for food, water, supplies, or medicine.
Coordinate with local health officials on ways to ensure care and services for special populations. Congregations and organizations with experience working with underserved communities (e.g., inmates of prisons and jails; homeless persons; immigrants; refugees; those with limited English proficiency; single-parent families; public housing residents; migrant-, farm-, and other low-wage workers) can work with local health officials to ensure these groups receive appropriate care and services.
Consider focusing your organization’s efforts to provide services that are most needed during the emergency, such as mental health, spiritual health, or social services.
Clergy and volunteers may be asked to provide support to community members, especially ill persons, their family or household members, and emergency responders, who will be under increased stress. Those who have lost loved ones may need support working through the grieving process.
CFBOs can identify mental health or counseling resources. Trusted community leaders can work to decrease the stigma associated with using mental health resources and assure that materials are culturally and ethnically sensitive and are available in a variety of languages.

There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is currently known about the virus and about similar coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, but disease transmission via infectious aerosols is currently uncertain. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus in general occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through fomites. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in community settings.
It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air.
This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of rooms or areas occupied by those with suspected or with confirmed COVID-19. It is aimed at limiting the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in key environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.
These guidelines are focused on community, non-healthcare facilities such as schools, institutions of higher education, offices, daycare centers, businesses, and community centers that do, and do not, house persons overnight. These guidelines are not meant  for cleaning staff in healthcare facilities or repatriation sites, households, or for others for whom specific guidance already exists.
Community facilities such as schools, daycare centers, and businesses comprise most non-healthcare settings that are visited by the general public outside of a household.
Disinfecting works by using chemicals, for example EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. But killing germs remaining on a surface after cleaning further reduces any risk of spreading infection.
Cleaning and Disinfection After Persons Suspected/Confirmed to Have COVID-19 Have Been in the Facility
Timing and location of cleaning and disinfection of surfaces
 Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection.
Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces.
Follow Interim Guidance for US Institutions of Higher Education on working with state and local health officials to isolate ill persons and provide temporary housing as needed.
Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection.
In areas where ill persons are being housed in isolation, follow Interim Guidance for Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection for U.S. Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019. This includes focusing on cleaning and disinfecting common areas where staff/others providing services may come into contact with ill persons but reducing cleaning and disinfection of bedrooms/bathrooms used by ill persons to as-needed.
In areas where ill persons have visited or used, continue routine cleaning and disinfection as in this guidance.
How to Clean and Disinfect
If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.
A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here
. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products for concentration, application method and contact time, etc.
Additionally, diluted household bleach solutions (at least 1000ppm sodium hypochlorite) can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute, and allowing proper ventilation during and after application. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.
Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.
If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.
In order to minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.
Clean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry according to guidance above for hard or soft surfaces.
Gloves and gowns should be compatible with the disinfectant products being used.
Additional PPE might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash.
If gowns are not available, coveralls, aprons or work uniforms can be worn during cleaning and disinfecting. Reuseable (washable) clothing should be laundered afterwards. Clean hands after handling dirty laundry.
Cleaning staff and others should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.
Employers should work with their local and state health departments to ensure appropriate local protocols and guidelines, such as updated/additional guidance for cleaning and disinfection, are followed, including for identification of new potential cases of COVID-19.
Employers should educate staff and workers performing cleaning, laundry, and trash pick-up activities to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19 and provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms within 14 days after their last possible exposure to the virus. At a minimum, any staff should immediately notify their supervisor and the local health department if they develop symptoms of COVID-19. The health department will provide guidance on what actions need to be taken.

Interim guidance for homeless service providers to plan and respond to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this interim guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available.
Persons experiencing homelessness may be at risk for infection during an outbreak of COVID-19. This interim guidance is intended to support response planning by homeless service providers, including overnight emergency shelters, day shelters, and meal service providers.
COVID-19 is caused by a new virus. There is much to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features of the disease. Everyone can do their part to help plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat.
CDC has developed recommendations for homeless service providers about how to protect their staff, clients, and guests. The Before, During, and After sections of this guidance offer suggested strategies to help homeless service providers plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat.
Before a COVID-19 outbreak occurs: Plan
During a COVID-19 outbreak: Act
After a COVID-19 outbreak: Follow-up
Before a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community: Plan
Although it is not possible to know the course of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, preparing now is the best way to protect people experiencing homelessness, homeless service provider staff, and volunteers from this disease. An outbreak of COVID-19 in your community could cause illness among people experiencing homelessness, contribute to an increase in emergency shelter usage, and/or lead to illness and absenteeism among homeless service provider staff.
Establish ongoing communication with your local public health department to facilitate access to relevant information before and during an outbreak.
Having an emergency plan in place can help reduce the impact of the outbreak. During your planning process, homeless service providers should collaborate, share information, and review plans with community leaders and local public health officials to help protect their staff, clients, and guests. Set a time to discuss what homeless service providers should do if cases of COVID-19 are suspected in their facility, if a confirmed case of COVID-19 is identified in a client, or if a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a person experiencing homelessness is discharged from a local hospital. Identify if alternate care sites are available for clients with confirmed COVID-19 or if service providers should plan to isolate cases within their facility.
Find out if your local government has a private-public emergency planning group that meets regularly. Building strong alliances before an outbreak may provide your organization with the support and resources needed to respond effectively. Also, in recognition of the “whole community”
approach to emergency planning and management, your input as community leaders and stakeholders helps ensure that your local government’s emergency operations plan is complete and represented.
Develop or update your emergency operations plan
Identify a list of key contacts at your local and state health departments.
Identify a list of healthcare facilities and alternative care sites where clients with respiratory illness can seek housing and receive appropriate care.
Address key prevention strategies in your emergency operations plan
Promote the practice of everyday preventive actions. Use health messages and materials developed by credible public health sources, such as your local and state public health departments or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Read more about everyday preventive actions.
Provide COVID-19 prevention supplies at your organization. Have supplies on hand for staff, volunteers, and those you serve, such as soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol, tissues, trash baskets, and disposable facemasks
. Plan to have extra supplies on hand during a COVID-19 outbreak.
Be prepared to report cases of respiratory illness that might be COVID-19 to your local health department and to transport persons with severe illness to medical facilities. Discuss reporting procedures ahead of time with a contact person at your local health department.
If possible, identify space that can be used to accommodate clients with mild respiratory symptoms and separate them from others. Most persons with COVID-19 infections will likely have mild symptoms and not require hospital care. Furthermore, it might not be possible to determine if a person has COVID-19 or another respiratory illness. Designate a room and bathroom (if available) for clients with mild illness who remain at the shelter and develop a plan for cleaning the room daily.
Identify clients who could be at high risk for complications from COVID-19 (those who are older or have underlying health conditions) to ensure their needs are taken into consideration.
Prepare healthcare clinic staff to care for patients with COVID-19, if your facility provides healthcare services and ensure facility has supply of personal protective equipment.
Plan for higher shelter usage during the outbreak. Consult with community leaders, local public health departments, and faith-based organizations about places to refer clients if your shelter space is full. Identify short-term volunteers to staff shelter with more usage or alternate sites. Consider the need for extra supplies (e.g., food, toiletries, etc.) and surge staff, ensuring they have personal protective equipment.
Communicate about COVID-19 and everyday preventive actions
Create a communication plan for distributing timely and accurate information during an outbreak. Identify everyone in your chain of communication (for example, staff, volunteers, key community partners and stakeholders, and clients) and establish systems for sharing information. Maintain up-to-date contact information for everyone in the chain of communication. Identify platforms, such as a hotline, automated text messaging, and a website to help disseminate information to those inside and outside your organization. You also can learn more about communicating to workers in a crisis
Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to workers, volunteers, and those you serve. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures.
People experiencing homelessness may be at increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes, particularly during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Learn more about mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Get input and support for your emergency operations and communication plans
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community: Act
If cases or clusters of COVID-19 disease are reported in your community, put your emergency plan into action, to protect your clients, staff, and guests.
Early action to slow the spread of COVID-19 will help keep staff and volunteers healthy and help your organization maintain normal operations.
Put your emergency operations and communication plans into action
Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Get up-to-date information about local COVID-19 activity from public health officials. Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area because these may affect your staff, volunteers, and families you serve.
Note: Early in the outbreak, local public health officials may recommend schools be dismissed temporarily to allow time to gather information about how fast and severe COVID-19 is spreading in your community. Temporary school dismissals also can help slow the spread of COVID-19.
Implement everyday preventive actions and provide instructions to your workers about actions to prevent disease spread. Meet with your staff to discuss plans to help clients implement personal preventive measures.
Communicate with your local health department if you are concerned that clients in your facility might have COVID-19. Learn more about COVID-19 symptoms.
Download COVID-19 posters and CDC Fact Sheets and keep your clients and guests informed about public health recommendations to prevent disease spread and about changes to services that might be related to the outbreak. Messaging may include:
Providing educational materials about COVID-19 for non-English speakers, as needed.
Encouraging ill staff and volunteers to stay home (or be sent home if they develop symptoms while at the facility), to prevent transmitting the infection to others.
Minimize the number of staff members who have face-to-face interactions with clients with respiratory symptoms. Use physical barriers to protect staff who will have interactions with clients with unknown infection status (e.g. check-in staff). For example, install a sneeze guard at the check-in desk or place an additional table between staff and clients to increase the distance between them.
Note: Disposable facemasks should be reserved for use by clients who exhibit respiratory symptoms.  Clients who become sick should be given a clean disposable facemask to wear while staying at the shelter.
Staff and volunteers at high risk of severe COVID-19 (those who are older or have underlying health conditions) should not be designated as caregivers for sick clients who are staying in the shelter.
Ensure that clients receive assistance in preventing disease spread and accessing care, as needed
In general sleeping areas (for those who are not experiencing respiratory symptoms), ensure that beds/mats are at least 3 feet apart, and request that all clients sleep head-to-toe
Provide access to fluids, tissues, plastic bags for the proper disposal of used tissues.
Ensure bathrooms and other sinks are consistently stocked with soap and drying materials for handwashing. Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol (if that is an option at your shelter) at key points within the facility, including registration desks, entrances/exits, and eating areas.
At check-in, provide any client with respiratory symptoms (cough, fever) with a surgical mask.
If there is person to person spread in your local community, clients may have COVID-19.
Monitor clients who could be at high risk for complications from COVID-19 (those who are older or have underlying health conditions) and reach out to them regularly.
Confine clients with mild respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection to individual rooms, if possible, and have them avoid common areas.
If possible, designate a separate bathroom for sick clients with COVID-19 symptoms.
Decisions about whether clients with mild illness due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should remain in the shelter or be directed to alternative housing sites should be made in coordination with local health authorities. Similarly, identifying respite care locations for patients with confirmed COVID-19 who have been discharged from the hospital should be made in coordination with local healthcare facilities and your local health department.
If you identify any client with severe symptoms, notify your public health department and arrange for the client to receive immediate medical care. If this is a client with suspected COVID-19, notify the transfer team and medical facility before transfer. Severe symptoms include:
After a COVID-19 outbreak has ended in your community: Follow Up
Remember, a COVID-19 outbreak could last a long time, and the impact on your facility may be considerable. When public health officials determine the outbreak has ended in your community, take time to talk over your experiences with your clients and staff.  As public health officials continue to plan for COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks, you and your organization have an important role to play in ongoing planning efforts.
Discuss and note lessons learned. Were your COVID-19 preparedness actions effective at your organization? Talk about problems found in your plan and effective solutions. Identify additional resources needed for you and your organization.
Participate in community discussions about emergency planning. Let others know about what readiness actions worked. Maintain communication lines with your community (e.g., social media and email lists).
Maintain and expand your emergency planning. Look for ways to expand community partnerships. Identify agencies or partners needed to help you prepare for an infectious disease outbreak in the future.

Taking Advantage of the 15-Day Pause to Slow the Spread of COVID-19
While every community is unique and experiencing varying levels of community transmission, the 15-day pause recommended by the White House presents the entire country with an opportunity to assess how prepared we are and take steps to implement actions designed to slow and limit the spread of COVID-19.  We understand that the pause may last longer than 15 days.
At some point, the recommended actions will change. Community leaders must come together to facilitate services and businesses re-opening in an orderly way. The resumption of activities needs planning so that it does not negatively affect ongoing mitigation efforts in local areas or the country as a whole.

Plan, Prepare, and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
What is the role of schools in responding to COVID-19?
How should schools prepare for, and respond to, COVID-19?
Clarification of appropriate mitigation strategies based on level of community transmission of COVID-19 and presence of COVID-19 cases within the school.
Schools, working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of diseases and protecting vulnerable students and staff, to help ensure students have safe and healthy learning environments.
All decisions about implementing school-based strategies (e.g., dismissals, event cancellations, other social distancing measures) should be made locally, in collaboration with local health officials who can help determine the level of transmission in the community. Information about level of transmission is available in CDC’s framework for mitigation
This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the CDC COVID-19 website periodically for updated interim guidance.
Health officials are currently taking steps to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 into US communities. Schools play an important role in this effort. Through collaboration and coordination with local health departments, schools should take steps to disseminate information about the disease and its potential transmission within their school community. Schools should prepare to take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among their students and staff should local health officials identify such a need.
Schools should continue to collaborate, share information, and review plans with local health officials to help protect the whole school community, including those with special health needs. School plans should be designed to complement other community mitigation strategies to protect high risk populations and the healthcare system, and minimize disruption to teaching and learning and protect students and staff from social stigma and discrimination. Plans should build on everyday practices (e.g., encouraging hand hygiene, monitoring absenteeism, communicating routinely) that include strategies for before, during, and after a possible outbreak.
This guidance will help child care programs, schools, and their partners understand how to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 within child care and school communities and facilities. It also aims to help child care programs, schools, and partners react quickly should a case be identified. The guidance includes considerations to help administrators plan for the continuity of teaching and learning if there is community spread of COVID-19.
What is the role of schools in responding to COVID-19?
Schools, working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of diseases to help ensure students have safe and healthy learning environments. Schools serve students, staff, and visitors from throughout the community. All of these people may have close contact in the school setting, often sharing spaces, equipment, and supplies.
Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that children with confirmed COVID-19 generally had mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. People who have serious chronic medical conditions are believed to be at higher risk. Despite lower risk of serious illness among most children, children with COVID-19-like symptoms should avoid contact with others who might be at higher risk, such as older adults and adults with serious chronic medical conditions.
How should schools prepare for, and respond to, COVID-19?
Schools should be prepared for COVID-19 outbreaks in their local communities and for individual exposure events to occur in their facilities, regardless of the level of community transmission, for example a case associated with recent travel to an area with sustained COVID-19 transmission. The following decision tree can be used to help schools determine which set of mitigation strategies may be most appropriate for their current situation.
Any school in any community might need to implement short-term closure procedures regardless of community spread if an infected person has been in a school building. If this happens, CDC recommends the following procedures regardless of the level of community spread:
Coordinate with local health officials. Once learning of a COVID-19 case in someone who has been in the school, immediately notify local health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for their child care programs or schools.
Dismiss students and most staff for 2-5 days. This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the school. This allows the local health officials to help the school determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended dismissal duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.
Local health officials’ recommendations for the scope (e.g., a single school, multiple schools, the full district) and duration of school dismissals will be made on a case-by-case basis using the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and the specific cases in the community.
Communicate with staff, parents, and students. Coordinate with local health officials to communicate dismissal decisions and the possible COVID-19 exposure.
This communication to the school community should align with the communication plan in the school’s emergency operations plan.
Clean and disinfect thoroughly.
Close off areas used by the individuals with COVID-19 and wait as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection to minimize potential for exposure to respiratory droplets. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area. If possible, wait up to 24 hours before beginning cleaning and disinfection.
Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas (e.g., offices, bathrooms, and common areas) used by the ill persons, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces.
If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
For disinfection most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.
A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here
. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Additionally, diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.  Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:
Additional information on cleaning and disinfection of community facilities such as schools can be found on CDC’s website.
Make decisions about extending the school dismissal. Temporarily dismissing child care programs and K-12 schools is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities.
During school dismissals (after cleaning and disinfection), child care programs and schools may stay open for staff members (unless ill) while students stay home. Keeping facilities open: a) allows teachers to develop and deliver lessons and materials remotely, thus maintaining continuity of teaching and learning; and b) allows other staff members to continue to provide services and help with additional response efforts. Decisions on which, if any, staff should be allowed in the school should be made in collaboration with local health officials.
Child care and school administrators should work in close collaboration and coordination with local health officials to make dismissal and large event cancellation decisions. Schools are not expected to make decisions about dismissal or canceling events on their own. School dismissals and event cancellations may be extended if advised by local health officials. The nature of these actions (e.g., geographic scope, duration) may change as the local outbreak situation evolves.
Administrators should seek guidance from local health officials to determine when students and staff should return to schools and what additional steps are needed for the school community. In addition, students and staff who are well but are taking care of or share a home with someone with a case of COVID-19 should follow instructions from local health officials to determine when to return to school.
If there is community spread of COVID-19, design strategies to avoid distribution in settings where people might gather in a group or crowd. Consider options such as “grab-and-go” bagged lunches or meal delivery.
Consider alternatives for providing essential medical and social services for students.
Continue providing necessary services for children with special healthcare needs, or work with the state Title V Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs (CYSHCN) Program.
The most important thing to do now is plan and prepare. Administrators should reinforce healthy practices among their students and staff. As the global outbreak evolves, schools should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks. Schools need to be ready if COVID-19 does appear in their communities. Here are some strategies:
Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs). This should be done in collaboration with local health departments
and other relevant partners. Focus on the components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks.
Ensure the plan includes strategies to reduce the spread of a wide variety of infectious diseases (e.g., seasonal influenza). This includes strategies for social distancing and school dismissal that may be used to stop or slow the spread of infectious disease. The plan should also include strategies for continuing education, meal programs, and other related services in the event of school dismissal.
Other health and education professional organizations may also have helpful resources your child care facility or school can use or share. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics provides information on germ prevention strategies
Multiple federal agencies have developed resources on school planning principles and a 6-step process for creating plans to build and continually foster safe and healthy school communities before, during, and after possible emergencies. Key resources include guidance on developing high-quality school emergency operations plans
, and a companion guide on the role of school districts in developing high-quality school emergency operations plans
The Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance (TA) Center’s website
contains free resources, trainings, and TA to schools and their community partners, including many tools and resources on emergency planning and response to infectious disease outbreaks.
Information-sharing systems can be used for day-to-day reporting (on information such as changes in absenteeism) and disease surveillance efforts to detect and respond to an outbreak.
Local health officials should be a key partner in information sharing.
Teach and reinforce healthy hygiene practices.
Train staff on healthy hygiene practices so they can teach these to students.
Ensure handwashing strategies include washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include health promotion materials, information on proper handwashing technique, and tips for families to help children develop good handwashing habits.
Ensure adequate supplies (e.g., soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer, tissue) to support healthy hygiene practices.
Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts.
Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched. This may include cleaning objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops). Clean with the cleaners typically used. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label. For disinfection most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here
. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Ensure adequate supplies to support cleaning and disinfection practices.
Alert local health officials about large increases in student and staff absenteeism, particularly if absences appear due to respiratory illnesses (like the common cold or the “flu,” which have symptoms similar to COVID-19).
Ensure you have a clear understanding of all upcoming gatherings and large events for your school community (e.g., assemblies, field days, spirit nights, athletic events). Give special consideration to events that might put students, staff, or their families in close proximity to others from communities that may have identified cases of COVID-19.
Consider whether any of these events should be canceled. Speak with local health officials to help determine the best approach.
Keep sick students and staff, particularly those with symptoms of respiratory illness, separate from well students and staff until they can leave. Plan to have areas where these individuals can be isolated from well students and staff until they can leave the school.
Remember that schools are not expected to screen students or staff to identify cases of COVID-19. If a community (or more specifically, a school) has cases of COVID-19, local health officials will help identify those individuals and will follow up on next steps.
Share resources with the school community to help families understand when to keep children home. This guidance, not specific to COVID-19, from the American Academy of Pediatrics can be helpful for families
Test communication capacity, and reiterate steps staff, students, and families can take to stay healthy and guidance that they should stay home if sick.
Child care and K-12 administrators can support their school community by sharing resources with students (if resources are age-appropriate), their families, and staff. Coordinate with local health officials to determine what type of information might be best to share with the school community. Consider sharing the following fact sheets and information sources:
Information about COVID-19 available through state and local
health departments

CDC Information on COVID-19 and children
CDC information for staff, students, and their families who have recently traveled back to the United States from areas where CDC has identified community spread of coronavirus:
A list of countries where community spread of COVID-19 is occurring can be found on the CDC webpage: Coronavirus Disease 2019 Information for Travel
For questions about students who plan to travel, or have recently traveled, to areas with community spread of COVID-19, refer to CDC’s FAQ for travelers. Schools can also consult with state and local health officials. Schools may need to postpone or cancel trips that could expose students and staff to potential community spread of COVID-19. Students returning from travel to areas with community spread of COVID-19 must follow guidance they have received from health officials. COVID-19 information for travel is updated regularly on the CDC website.
If local health officials report that there are multiple cases of COVID-19 in the community, schools may need to implement additional strategies in response to prevent spread in the school, but they should continue using the strategies they implemented when there was no community transmission. These additional strategies include:
Coordinate with local health officials. This should be a first step in making decisions about responses to the presence of COVID-19 in the community. Health officials can help a school determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for their specific community’s situation.
Implement multiple social distancing strategies. Select strategies based on feasibility given the unique space and needs of the school. Not all strategies will be feasible for all schools. For example, limiting hall movement options can be particularly challenging in secondary schools. Many strategies that are feasible in primary or secondary schools may be less feasible in child care settings. Administrators are encouraged to think creatively about all opportunities to increase the physical space between students and limit interactions in large group settings. Schools may consider strategies such as:
Increase the space between desks. Rearrange student desks to maximize the space between students. Turn desks to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other) to reduce transmission caused from virus-containing droplets (e.g., from talking, coughing, sneezing).
Reduce congestion in the health office. For example, use the health office for children with flu-like symptoms and a satellite location for first aid or medication distribution.
Consider ways to accommodate the needs of children and families at risk for serious illness from COVID-19. Consider if and how to honor requests of parents who may have concerns about their children attending school due to underlying medical conditions of their children or others in their home.
Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use for other viral illnesses, is available in this CDC publication
Continue to coordinate with local health officials. If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for child care programs or schools. These strategies are expected to extend across multiple programs, schools, or school districts within the community, as they are not necessarily tied to cases within schools or child care facilities.
Consider extended school dismissals. In collaboration with local health officials, implement extended school dismissals (e.g., dismissals for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended school dismissals, also cancel extracurricular group activities, school-based afterschool programs, and large events (e.g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events). Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education (e.g., distance learning) as well as meal programs and other essential services for students.

Talking with children about Coronavirus Disease 2019
As public conversations around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increase, children may worry about themselves, their family, and friends getting ill with COVID-19. Parents, family members, school staff, and other trusted adults can play an important role in helping children make sense of what they hear in a way that is honest, accurate, and minimizes anxiety or fear. CDC has created guidance to help adults have conversations with children about COVID-19 and ways they can avoid getting and spreading the disease.
Remember that viruses can make anyone sick, regardless of a person’s race or ethnicity. Avoid making assumptions about who might have COVID-19.
Consider reducing the amount of screen time focused on COVID-19. Too much information on one topic can lead to anxiety.
Talk to children about how some stories on COVID-19 on the Internet and social media may be based on rumors and inaccurate information.
If soap and water are not available, teach them to use hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol. Supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol, especially in schools and child care facilities.
Facts about COVID-19 for discussions with children
Try to keep information simple and remind them that health and school officials are working hard to keep everyone safe and healthy.
What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is the short name for “coronavirus disease 2019.” It is a new virus. Doctors and scientists are still learning about it.
Recently, this virus has made a lot of people sick. Scientists and doctors think that most people will be ok, especially kids, but some people might get pretty sick.
Doctors and health experts are working hard to help people stay healthy.
What can I do so that I don’t get COVID-19?
You can practice healthy habits at home, school, and play to help protect against the spread of COVID-19:
Keep things clean. Older children can help adults at home and school clean the things we touch the most, like desks, doorknobs, light switches, and remote controls. (Note for adults: you can find more information about cleaning and disinfecting on CDC’s website.)
What happens if you get sick with COVID-19?
COVID-19 can look different in different people. For many people, being sick with COVID-19 would be a little bit like having the flu. People can get a fever, cough, or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID-19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems. From what doctors have seen so far, most children don’t seem to get very sick. While a lot of adults get sick, most adults get better.
If you do get sick, it doesn’t mean you have COVID-19. People can get sick from all kinds of germs. What’s important to remember is that if you do get sick, the adults at home and school will help get you any help that you need.
If you suspect your child may have COVID-19, call the healthcare facility to let them know before you bring your child in to see them.

Interim guidance to prevent spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Encourage moving election polling locations away from long term care facilities and facilities housing older persons to minimize COVID-19 exposure among older individuals and those with chronic medical conditions.
Updated EPA COVID Disinfectant link.
There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is currently known about SARS-CoV-2 and about similar coronaviruses, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus in general occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through contact with contaminated surfaces. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in election polling locations.
This guidance provides recommendations on the routine cleaning and disinfection of polling location areas and associated voting equipment (e.g., pens, voting machines, computers). It suggests actions that polling station workers can take to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by limiting the survival of the virus in the environment. This guidance will be updated if additional information becomes available.
Community settings (e.g. polling locations, households, schools, daycares, businesses) encompass most non-healthcare settings and are visited by the general public.
Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. Disinfecting works by using chemicals to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. But killing germs remaining on a surface after cleaning further reduce any risk of spreading infection.
Encourage relocating polling places from nursing homes, long-term care facilities, and senior living residences, to minimize COVID-19 exposure among older individuals and those with chronic medical conditions.
Consider additional social distancing and other measures to protect these individuals during voting.
Stay at home if you have fever, respiratory symptoms, or believe you are sick
Practice hand hygiene frequently: wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Disinfect surfaces that may be contaminated with germs after cleaning: A list of products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims
 is available. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are expected to be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, use of personal protective equipment).
Clean and disinfect voting-associated equipment (e.g., voting machines, laptops, tablets, keyboards) routinely. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.
Consult with the voting machine manufacturer for guidance on appropriate disinfection products for voting machines and associated electronics.
If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at least 70% alcohol to clean voting machine buttons and touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.
Based on available data, the most important measures to prevent transmission of viruses in crowded public areas include careful and consistent cleaning of one’s hands. Therefore:
Provide an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol for use before or after using the voting machine or the final step in the voting process. Consider placing the alcohol-based hand sanitizer in visible, frequently used locations such as registration desks and exits.
Incorporate social distancing strategies, as feasible.Social distancing strategies increase the space between individuals and decrease the frequency of contact among individuals to reduce the risk of spreading a disease. Keeping individuals at least 6 feet apart is ideal based on what is known about COVID-19. If this is not feasible, efforts should be made to keep individuals as far apart as is practical. Feasibility of strategies will depend on the space available in the polling station and the number of voters who arrive at one time. Polling station workers can:
Discourage voters and workers from greeting others with physical contact (e.g., handshakes). Include this reminder on signs about social distancing.

Plan, Prepare, and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
What is the role of IHE in responding to COVID-19?
How should IHEs prepare for, and respond to, COVID-19?
Clarification of appropriate mitigation strategies, based on level of community transmission of COVID-19 and presence of COVID-19 cases within the IHE.
Institutions of higher education (IHE), working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of diseases, and protecting vulnerable students, staff, and faculty to help ensure a safe and healthy learning environment.
Guidance for IHE is organized into three categories based on the level of community transmission: 1) when there is no community transmission (preparedness phase), 2) when there is minimal to moderate community transmission, and 3) when there is substantial community transmission. Consult with your local health department to determine what level of transmission is currently occurring in your community.
All decisions about implementing IHE-based strategies (e.g., class suspensions, event cancellations, other social distancing measures) should be made in collaboration with local health officials.
Older adults and persons with severe underlying health conditions are at increased risk of more serious illness after contracting COVID-19. Priority should be given to ensuring the safety of these groups of people. See more information on those at increased risk of more serious illness due to COVID-19.
This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the following CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.
Health officials are currently taking steps to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 into US communities. IHE play an important role in this effort. Through collaboration and coordination with local health departments, IHE should take steps to disseminate information about the disease and its potential transmission within their IHE community. IHE should prepare to take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among their students and staff should local health officials identify community transmission.
IHE should continue to collaborate, share information, and review plans with local health officials to help protect the whole IHE community, including those with special health needs. IHE plans should be designed to complement other community mitigation strategies to protect high risk populations and the healthcare system and minimize disruption to teaching and learning and protect students, staff, and faculty from social stigma and discrimination. Plans should build on everyday practices (e.g., encouraging hand hygiene, monitoring absenteeism, communicating routinely) that include strategies for before, during, and after a possible outbreak.
This guidance will help IHE and their partners understand how to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 among students, faculty, and staff. It also aims to help IHE react quickly should a case be identified in the IHE or if there is spread within the community in which the IHE is located.  The guidance includes considerations to help administrators plan for the continuity of teaching, learning, and research if there is community spread of COVID-19 and address concerns related to COVID-19 associated stigma.
What is the role of IHE in responding to COVID-19?
IHE, working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of disease. IHE’s efforts will help ensure students, staff, and faculty have safe and healthy environments in which to learn and work. IHE welcome students, staff, faculty, and visitors from throughout the community. All of these people may have close contact in IHE settings, often sharing spaces, equipment, and supplies.
Some individuals are experiencing stigma and discrimination in the United States related to COVID-19. This includes people of Chinese and Asian descent, as well as some returning travelers and emergency responders who may have been exposed to the virus. It is important for IHE to provide accurate and timely information about COVID-19 to students, staff, and faculty to minimize the potential for stigma on college and university campuses. It is also important to provide mental health support to promote resilience among those groups affected by stigma regarding COVID-19. CDC has information IHE can share to reduce COVID-19 associated fear and stigma.
How should IHEs prepare for, and respond to, COVID-19?
IHE should be prepared for COVID-19 outbreaks in their local communities and for individual exposure events to occur in facilities, regardless of the level of community transmission, for example, a case associated with travel. The following decision tree can be used to help IHE administrators determine which set of mitigation strategies may be most appropriate for their current situation.
Any IHE in any community might need to implement short-term building closure procedures regardless of community spread if an infected person has been on campus. If this happens, CDC recommends the following procedures, regardless of level of community spread:
Coordinate with local health officials. Once learning of a COVID-19 case in someone who has been on the campus, immediately reach out to local public health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for their IHE.
Work with local public health officials to determine cancellation of classes and closure of buildings and facilities. IHE administrators should work closely with their local health officials to determine if a short-term closure (for 2-5 days) of all campus buildings and facilities is needed. In some cases, IHE administrators, working with local health officials, may choose to only close buildings and facilities that had been entered by the individual(s) with COVID-19. This initial short-term class suspension and event and activity (e.g., club meetings; on-campus sport, theater, and music events) cancellation allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the IHE. This allows the local health officials to help the IHE determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.
Local health officials’ recommendations for the duration and extent of class suspensions, building and facility closures, and event and activity cancellations should be made on a case-by-case basis using the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and the specific cases in the community.
Communicate with students, staff, and faculty. Coordinate with local health officials to communicate dismissal decisions and the possible COVID-19 exposure.
This communication to the IHE community should align with the communication plan in the emergency operations plan.
In a circumstance where there is a confirmed COVID-19 case that has been on campus, it is critical to maintain confidentiality of the student or staff member as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, as applicable.
Clean and disinfect thoroughly.
Close off areas used by the patient. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area and then begin cleaning and disinfection.
Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas (e.g., offices, bathrooms, and common areas) used by the COVID-19 patient focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces.
If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
For disinfection most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.  A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here
. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Additional information on cleaning and disinfection of community facilities such as schools can be found on CDC’s website.
Make decisions about extending the class suspension and event and activity cancellation. Temporarily suspending classes is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities.
When classes are suspended, IHE administrators should work closely with local public health officials to determine if some buildings and facilities may stay open for staff or faculty that are not ill while students temporarily stop attending in-person classes.
IHE administrators should work in close collaboration with local public health officials and the IHE’s university system to make class suspension and large event and activity cancellation decisions. IHE are not expected to make decisions about suspending classes or canceling events on their own. IHE can seek specific guidance from local health officials to determine if, when, and for how long to take these steps. The nature of these actions (e.g., geographic scope, duration) may change as the local outbreak situation evolves.
Administrators should seek guidance from local health officials to determine when students, staff, and faculty should return to campus and what additional steps are needed for the IHE community. In addition, students, staff, and faculty who are well but are taking care of or share a home with someone with a case of COVID-19 should follow instructions from local health officials to determine when to return to campus.
Work in close collaboration with local public health officials to make all decisions related to on-campus housing.
If cases of COVID-19 have not been identified among residents of on-campus community housing, students may be allowed to remain in on-campus housing. In this situation, educate housing residents on the precautions they should take to help protect themselves when there is community spread of COVID-19. Residents should follow any more specific recommendations provided by local health officials. Any on-campus resident who may have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 should follow instructions provided by local public health officials, including possible temporary relocation to alternate housing for self-quarantine and monitoring for symptoms.
If cases of COVID-19 have been identified among residents of on-campus community housing, work with local public health officials to take additional precautions. Individuals with COVID-19 may need to be moved to temporary housing locations. These individuals will need to self-isolate and monitor for worsening symptoms according to the guidance of local health officials. Close contacts of the individuals with COVID-19 may also need temporary housing so that they can self-quarantine and monitor for symptoms. Consult with local health officials to determine when, how, and where to move ill residents. Information on providing home care to individuals with COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization is available on CDC’s website.
Residents identified with COVID-19 or identified as contacts of individuals with COVID-19 should not necessarily be sent to their permanent homes off-campus. Sending sick residents to their permanent homes could be unfeasible, pose logistical challenges, or pose risk of transmission to others either on the way to the home or once there. IHE should work with local public health officials to determine appropriate housing for the period in which they need to self-isolate and monitor for symptoms or worsening symptoms.
Ensure any staff remaining to support students in on-campus housing receive necessary training to protect themselves and residents from spread of COVID-19. Staff should also be trained on how to respond if a resident becomes ill. Adequate cleaning and personal hygiene supplies should be made available.
Consult with local health officials to determine strategies for modifying food service offerings to the IHE community.
If there is minimal to moderate or substantial community spread of COVID-19, design strategies to avoid food distribution in settings where people might gather in a group or crowd. Consider options such as “grab-and-go” bagged lunches or meal delivery.
If on-campus housing residents have been relocated to temporary alternative housing, consider how meals can be provided to these students. Work with local public health officials to determine strategies for providing meals to residents with COVID-19 or who are being monitored because of contact with persons with COVID-19.
Ensure any staff remaining on campus to support food services receive necessary training to protect themselves and those they serve from spread of COVID-19.
Consider alternatives for providing students with essential medical, social, and mental health services. Identify ways to ensure these services are provided while classes are dismissed or students are in temporary housing.
Identify other types of services provided to students, staff, and faculty (e.g., library services, cleaning services). Consider ways to adapt these to minimize risk of COVID-19 transmission while maintaining services deemed necessary.
The most important thing to do now is plan and prepare. IHE administrators should reinforce healthy practices among their students, staff, and faculty. As the global outbreak evolves, IHE should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks in their communities. IHE need to be ready in the event COVID-19 does appear in their communities. Here are some strategies:
Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs). This should be done in collaboration with local public health departments, the IHE’s university system, and other relevant partners. Focus on components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks.
Ensure the plan includes strategies to reduce the spread of a wide variety of infectious diseases (e.g., seasonal influenza). This includes strategies for social distancing and IHE dismissal that may be used to stop or slow the spread of infectious disease. The plan should also include strategies for continuing education, meal programs, and other related services in the event of IHE dismissal.
Multiple federal agencies have developed resources on school planning principles and a 6-step process for creating plans to build and continually foster safe and healthy school communities before, during, and after possible emergencies. IHE may find this guidance for developing high-quality emergency operations
Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance (TA) Center’s website
contains free resources, trainings, and TA for schools, including IHE, and their community partners, including many tools and resources on emergency planning and response to infectious disease outbreaks.
Institutional information systems should be used for day-to-day reporting on information such as absenteeism or changes in student health center traffic to detect and respond to an outbreak. Remember that IHE are not expected to screen students, staff, or faculty to identify cases of COVID-19.. If a community (or more specifically, an IHE) has cases of COVID-19, local health officials will help identify those individuals and will follow up on next steps.
Local health officials should be a key partner in information sharing.
Reinforce healthy hygiene practices.
Ensure handwashing strategies include washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include health promotion materials and information on proper handwashing technique.
Ensure adequate supplies (e.g., soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer, tissue) to support healthy hygiene practices.
Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts.
Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched. This may include cleaning objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops). Clean with the cleaners typically used. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label. For disinfection most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.
A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here
. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Ensure adequate supplies to support cleaning and disinfection practices.
Review attendance and sick leave policies. Students, staff, and faculty should not attend class or work when sick. Allow them to stay home to care for sick household members. Make accommodations (e.g., extended due dates, electronic submission of assignments), as possible, for individuals who may be temporarily unable to attend class due to restrictions placed on them related to possible exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.
Alert local health officials about large increases in student, staff, and faculty absenteeism or substantial increases in student health center traffic due to respiratory illnesses (like the common cold or the “flu,” which have symptoms similar to symptoms of COVID-19).
Ensure you have a clear understanding of all upcoming gatherings and large events for your IHE (e.g., special performances, athletic events, award banquets). Give special consideration to events that might put students, staff, or their families in close proximity to others from communities that may have identified cases of COVID-19 or include populations at increased risk of severe illness with COVID-19.
Consider whether any of these events should be canceled. Speak with local health officials to help determine the best approach.
Establish procedures to ensure students, staff, and faculty who become sick (with any illness) on campus or arrive on campus sick are sent to their place of residence (e.g., on-campus room or apartment, off-campus housing) as soon as possible. Keep sick individuals separate from well individuals until they can leave. Sick residents of on-campus housing in communities with no identified COVID-19 and who are not believed to have been exposed to COVID-19 should avoid contact with well individuals while sick.
Ensure IHE health clinics prepare for COVID-19.
Review CDC guidance to help healthcare facilities prepare for COVID-19. Guidance includes steps to take now and strategies for preparing for community transmission of COVID-19.
Include strategies to communicate information IHE community members can use to protect themselves from infectious disease, including COVID-19.
IHE administrators can support their IHE community by sharing COVID-19 informational resources with students, staff, and faculty.  Coordinate with local health officials to determine what type of information is best to share with the IHE community. Consider sharing the following fact sheets and information sources:
Information about COVID-19 available through state and local
 health departments
General fact sheets to help students, staff, faculty, and their families understand COVID-19 and the steps they can take to protect themselves:
What you need to know about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
What to do if you are sick with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Stop the spread of germs – help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19
Share facts about COVID-19 to help prevent stigma
CDC information for students, staff, and faculty who have recently traveled back to the United States from areas where CDC has identified community spread of COVID-19:
A list of countries where community spread of COVID-19 is occurring can be found on the CDC webpage: Coronavirus Disease 2019 Information for Travel
For guidance for students, staff, or faculty who plan to travel, or have recently traveled, to areas with community spread of COVID-19, refer to CDC’s FAQ for travelers and COVID-19 travel website. Students returning from travel to areas with community spread of COVID-19 must follow guidance they have received from health officials. For specific guidance on foreign exchange and study abroad programs, see CDC’s guidance on student foreign travel for IHE. IHE can also consult with state and local public health officials. IHE may need to postpone or cancel trips that could expose students and staff to potential community spread of COVID-19.
If local health officials report that there are multiple cases in the community, IHE may need to implement additional strategies in response to prevent spread in the IHE, but they should continue using the strategies they implemented when there was no community transmission. These additional strategies include:
Coordinate with local public health officials. This should be a first step in making decisions about responses to the presence of COVID-19 in the community. Health officials can help an IHE determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for their specific community’s situation.
Implement multiple social distancing strategies. Select strategies based on feasibility given the unique space and needs on IHE campuses. Not all strategies will be feasible for all IHE. IHE administrators are encouraged to think creatively about all opportunities to increase the physical space between students and limit interactions in large group settings. IHE may consider strategies such as:
Cancel large gatherings. Cancel activities and events such as athletic events or practices, or special performances for groups of 250 people or more. Cancel events for groups of 20 people or more if attendees are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19
Increase space between desks. Where possible, rearrange desks to maximize the space between students. Turn desks to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other) to reduce transmission caused from virus-containing droplets (e.g., from talking, coughing, sneezing).
Reduce congestion in the health clinic. For example, consider using the health clinic for students with flu-like symptoms and a satellite location for routine clinic visits (e.g., preventive screenings or annual exams).
Consider ways to accommodate the needs of students and staff at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19. Consider if and how to honor requests of students or staff who may have concerns about being on campus due to underlying medical conditions or those of others in their home.
Work in close collaboration with local health officials to make all decisions related to on-campus housing.
If cases of COVID-19 have not been identified among residents of on-campus community housing, students may be allowed to remain in on-campus housing. In this situation, educate housing residents on the precautions they should take to help protect themselves when there is community spread of COVID-19. Residents should follow any more specific recommendations provided by local health officials.
Share facts about COVID-19 through trusted dissemination channels to counter the spread of misinformation and mitigate fear.
Develop plans to support students, staff, and faculty who may feel overwhelmed by COVID-19 and associated events on campus.
Ensure continuity of mental health services, such as offering remote counseling. Encourage students to call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) if they are feeling overwhelmed with emotions such as sadness, depression, anxiety, or feel like wanting to harm themselves or others.
Continue to coordinate with local public health officials. If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for IHE. Mitigation strategies are expected to extend across organizations (e.g., K-12 schools, business, community and faith-based organizations) within the community, as they are not necessarily tied to cases within IHE.
Consider extended in-person class suspension. In collaboration with local public health officials, implement extended class suspension and event/activity cancellations (e.g., suspension/cancellations for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended class suspensions, also cancel extracurricular group activities and large events. Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education, research, and housing as well as meal programs and other essential services for students.

Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
Updated cleaning and disinfection guidance
Updated best practices for conducting social distancing
Updated strategies and recommendations that can be implemented now to respond to COVID-19
Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19
This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The outbreak first started in China, but the virus continues to spread internationally and in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available.
The following interim guidance may help prevent workplace exposures to COVID-19, in non-healthcare settings. (CDC has provided separate guidance for healthcare settings.) This guidance also provides planning considerations for community spread of COVID-19.
To prevent stigma and discrimination in the workplace, use only the guidance described below to determine risk of COVID-19 infection. Do not make determinations of risk based on race or country of origin and be sure to maintain confidentiality of people with confirmed coronavirus infection. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features of COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. Updates are available on CDC’s web page.
Preparing Workplaces for a COVID-19 Outbreak
Businesses and employers can prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19. Employers should plan to respond in a flexible way to varying levels of disease transmission in the community and be prepared to refine their business response plans as needed. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), most American workers will likely experience low (caution) or medium exposure risk levels at their job or place of employment (see OSHA guidance for employers
health officials so timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses. Local conditions will influence the decisions that public health officials make regarding community-level strategies. CDC has guidance for mitigation strategies
 according to the level of community transmission or impact of COVID-19.
All employers need to consider how best to decrease the spread of COVID-19 and lower the impact in their workplace. This may include activities in one or more of the following areas:
maintain healthy business operations, and
maintain a healthy work environment.
Employees who have symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) should notify their supervisor and stay home.
Sick employees should follow CDC-recommended steps. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.
Employees who are well but who have a sick family member at home with COVID-19 should notify their supervisor and follow CDC recommended precautions.
  Identify where and how workers might be exposed to COVID-19 at work:
See OSHA COVID-19
Be aware that some employees may be at higher risk for serious illness, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions. Consider minimizing face-to-face contact between these employees or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of six feet from other workers, customers and visitors, or to telework if possible.
Employees who appear to have symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) upon arrival at work or who become sick during the day should immediately be separated from other employees, customers, and visitors and sent home.
If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The fellow employees should then self-monitor for symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, or shortness of breath).
  Educate employees about how they can reduce the spread of COVID-19:
Employees can take steps to protect themselves at work and at home. Older people and people with serious chronic medical conditions are at higher risk for complications.
Follow the policies and procedures of your employer related to illness, cleaning and disinfecting, and work meetings and travel.
Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.
Inform your supervisor if you have a sick family member at home with COVID-19. Learn what to do if someone in your house is sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash and immediately wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. Learn more about coughing and sneezing etiquette on the CDC website.
Clean AND disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces such as workstations, keyboards, telephones, handrails, and doorknobs. Dirty surfaces can be cleaned with soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2
, the cause of COVID-19, and are appropriate for the surface.
Avoid using other employees’ phones, desks, offices, or other work tools and equipment, when possible. If necessary, clean and disinfect them before and after use.
Practice social distancing by avoiding large gatherings and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.
  Maintain Healthy Business Operations
Identify a workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 issues and their impact at the workplace.
Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of and understand these policies.
Employers that do not currently offer sick leave to some or all of their employees may want to draft non-punitive “emergency sick leave” policies.
Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work. Healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely manner.
Review human resources policies to make sure that policies and practices are consistent with public health recommendations and are consistent with existing state and federal workplace laws (for more information on employer responsibilities, visit the Department of Labor’s
Connect employees to employee assistance program (EAP) resources (if available) and community resources as needed. Employees may need additional social, behavioral, and other services, for example, to cope with the death of a loved one.
  Consider establishing policies and practices for social distancing. Social distancing should be implemented if recommended by state and local health authorities. Social distancing means avoiding large gatherings and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible (e.g., breakrooms and cafeterias). Strategies that business could use include:
  Employers with more than one business location are encouraged to provide local managers with the authority to take appropriate actions outlined in their COVID-19 response plan based on local conditions.
Maintain a healthy work environment
Provide soap and water in the workplace. If soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. If hands are visibly dirty, soap and water should be chosen over hand sanitizer. Ensure that adequate supplies are maintained.
  Perform routine environmental cleaning and disinfection:
Routinely clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as workstations, keyboards, telephones, handrails, and doorknobs.
If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here
. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Discourage workers from using other workers’ phones, desks, offices, or other work tools and equipment, when possible. If necessary, clean and disinfect them before and after use.
Provide disposable wipes so that commonly used surfaces (for example, doorknobs, keyboards, remote controls, desks, other work tools and equipment) can be wiped down by employees before each use. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-Cov-2
, the cause of COVID-19, and are appropriate for the surface.
  Perform enhanced cleaning and disinfection after persons suspected/confirmed to have COVID-19 have been in the facility:
If a sick employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, follow the CDC cleaning and disinfection recommendations.
Check the CDC’s Traveler’s Health Notices for the latest guidance and recommendations for each country to which you will travel. Specific travel information for travelers going to and returning from countries with travel advisories, and information for aircrew, can be found on the CDC website.
Advise employees to check themselves for symptoms of COVID-19 (i.e., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) before starting travel and notify their supervisor and stay home if they are sick.
Ensure employees who become sick while traveling or on temporary assignment understand that they should notify their supervisor and promptly call a healthcare provider for advice if needed.
If outside the United States, sick employees should follow company policy for obtaining medical care or contact a healthcare provider or overseas medical assistance company to assist them with finding an appropriate healthcare provider in that country. A U.S. consular officer can help locate healthcare services. However, U.S. embassies, consulates, and military facilities do not have the legal authority, capability, and resources to evacuate or give medicines, vaccines, or medical care to private U.S. citizens overseas.

What Law Enforcement Personnel Need to Know about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The outbreak first started in China, but cases have been identified in a growing number of other areas, including the United States.
Patients with COVID-19 have had mild to severe respiratory illness.
Data suggests that symptoms may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.
Symptoms can include fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and shortness of breath.
The virus causing COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. It is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person via respiratory droplets among close contacts. Respiratory droplets are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes and can land in the mouths or noses, or possibly be inhaled into the lungs, of people who are nearby. Close contact may include:
Being within approximately 6 feet of an individual with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time.
Having direct contact with body fluids (such as blood, phlegm, and respiratory droplets) from an individual with COVID-19.
Practice proper hand hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available and illicit drugs are NOT suspected to be present, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Have a trained Emergency Medical Service/ Emergency Medical Technician (EMS/EMT) assess and transport anyone you think might have COVID-19 to a healthcare facility.
Ensure only trained personnel wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) have contact with individuals who have or may have COVID-19.
Law enforcement who must make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 should follow CDC’s Interim Guidance for EMS. Different styles of PPE may be necessary to perform operational duties. These alternative styles (i.e. coveralls) must provide protection that is at least as great as that provided by the minimum amount of PPE recommended.
Disposable isolation gown or single-use/disposable coveralls*,
*If unable to wear a disposable gown or coveralls because it limits access to duty belt and gear, ensure duty belt and gear are disinfected after contact with individual.
Clean and disinfect duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the product label.
Follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE.
For law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low. Law enforcement leadership and personnel should follow CDC’s Interim General Business Guidance.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Given the global outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) institutes of higher education (IHE) should consider postponing or canceling upcoming student international travel programs. IHE should consider asking current program participants to return to their home country. Those overseeing student international travel programs should be aware that students may face unpredictable circumstances, travel restrictions, challenges in returning home or accessing health care while abroad.
IHEs should consider asking students participating in study abroad programs to return to the United States. IHEs should work with state and local public health officials to determine the best approach for when and how (for example, chartered transportation for countries or areas assessed as high-risk for exposure) their study abroad students might return. All plans for returning study abroad students should be designed to protect participants from stigma and discrimination.
The COVID-19 situation is dynamic. Given the speed of spread and the number of countries experiencing community transmission, IHEs should evaluate the risks associated with choosing to maintain programs abroad and take the appropriate proactive measures. IHEs that continue to maintain programs abroad should monitor COVID-19 for additional information.

Criteria for Return to Work for Healthcare Personnel with Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 (Interim Guidance)
CDC guidance for COVID-19 may be adapted by state and local health departments to respond to rapidly changing local circumstances.
Return to Work Criteria for HCP with Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19
Who this is for: Occupational health programs and public health officials making decisions about return to work for healthcare personnel (HCP) with confirmed COVID-19, or who have suspected COVID-19 (e.g., developed symptoms of a respiratory infection [e.g., cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, fever] but did not get tested for COVID-19).
Decisions about return to work for HCP with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should be made in the context of local circumstances. Options include a test-based strategy or a non-test-based strategy (i.e., time-since-illness-onset and time-since-recovery strategy).
Return to Work Criteria for HCP with Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19
Use one of the below strategies to determine when HCP may return to work in healthcare settings
Improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), and
Negative results of an FDA Emergency Use Authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens)[1]. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
At least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and,
At least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared
If HCP were never tested for COVID-19 but have an alternate diagnosis (e.g., tested positive for influenza), criteria for return to work should be based on that diagnosis.
Wear a facemask at all times while in the healthcare facility until all symptoms are completely resolved or until 14 days after illness onset, whichever is longer
Self-monitor for symptoms, and seek re-evaluation from occupational health if respiratory symptoms recur or worsen
Healthcare systems, healthcare facilities, and the appropriate state, local, territorial, and/or tribal health authorities might determine that the recommended approaches cannot be followed due to the need to mitigate HCP staffing shortages. In such scenarios:
HCP should be evaluated by occupational health to determine appropriateness of earlier return to work than recommended above
If HCP return to work earlier than recommended above, they should still adhere to the Return to Work Practices and Work Restrictions recommendations above. For more information, see CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with COVID-19.
1All test results should be final before isolation is ended. Testing guidance is based upon limited information and is subject to change as more information becomes available. In persons with a persistent productive cough, SARS-CoV-2-RNA might be detected for longer periods in sputum specimens than in upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal swab) specimens.

Prepare to Care for COVID-19: Get Your Practice Ready
America’s medical providers deliver the best care possible and are trusted sources of health information for their patients and the community. CDC is committed to arming them with the accurate and helpful information they need to treat patients with COVID-19, keep other patients and staff safe, and empower patients to protect their own health. Leveraging telemedicine whenever possible is the best way to protect patients and staff from COVID-19. However, when telemedicine is not possible, simple actions can help to reduce the risk of spread and keep people safe.
CDC’s Prepare to Care for COVID-19 is a resource with practical tools clinicians can use to care for patients with COVID-19, and will be regularly updated to help clinicians adapt as the outbreak unfolds.

Interim Guidance for Healthcare Facilities: Preparing for Community Transmission of COVID-19 in the United States
Key Considerations for Healthcare Facilities:
Currently there are no medications to treat or vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Therefore, community approaches to slowing transmission including appropriate hand hygiene, cough etiquette, social distancing, and reducing face-to-face contact with potential COVID-19 cases are needed to slow disease transmission and reduce the number of people who get sick. In each healthcare facility, the primary goals include:
Provision of the appropriate level of medical care
Protecting healthcare personnel and non-COVID-19 patients accessing healthcare from infection
Purpose of this document: This interim guidance outlines goals and strategies for all U.S. healthcare facilities to prepare for and respond to community spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Although it is not possible to predict the future course of the outbreak, planning for a scenario in which many persons become ill and seek care at the same time is an important part of preparedness and can improve outcomes if an outbreak occurs. Therefore, preserving healthcare system functioning is paramount. It is critical for healthcare facilities to continue to provide care for all patients, irrespective of COVID-19 infection status, at the appropriate level (e.g., home-based care, outpatient, urgent care, emergency room, or hospitalization). Facilities may need to respond to a surge in patients requiring care. Concentrated efforts will be required to mobilize all aspects of healthcare to reduce transmission of disease, direct people to the right level of care, and decrease the burden on the healthcare system.
Public health guidance will shift as the COVID-19 outbreak evolves. All healthcare facilities should be aware of any updates to local and state public health recommendations.
Key Goals for the U.S. healthcare system in response to the COVID-19 outbreak are to:
Minimize disease transmission
Protect healthcare personnel
Preserve healthcare system functioning
Actions to take now to prepare for an outbreak of COVID-19
Designate a time to meet with your staff to educate them on COVID-19 and what they may need to do to prepare. The following may be useful resources to share information about COVID-19:
How COVID-19 spreads
Clinical management of COVID-19 patients
Infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19
Explore alternatives to face-to-face triage and visits. The following options can reduce unnecessary healthcare visits and prevent transmission of respiratory viruses in your facility:
Instruct patients to use available advice lines, patient portals, on-line self-assessment tools, or call and speak to an office/clinic staff if they become ill with symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
Identify staff to conduct telephonic and telehealth interactions with patients. Develop protocols so that staff can triage and assess patients quickly.
Determine algorithms to identify which patients can be managed by telephone and advised to stay home, and which patients will need to be sent for emergency care or come to your facility.
Instruct patients that if they have respiratory symptoms they should call before they leave home, so staff can be prepared to care for them when they arrive.
Prepare your facility to safely triage and manage patients with respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Become familiar with infection prevention and control guidance for managing COVID-19 patients.
Ensure supplies are available (tissues, waste receptacles, alcohol-based hand sanitizer)
Facemasks are available at triage for patients with respiratory symptoms
Create an area for spatially separating patients with respiratory symptoms. Ideally patients would be >6 feet apart in waiting areas.
Plan to Take the Following Actions if COVID-19 is spreading in your community
Work with local and state public health organizations, healthcare coalitions, and other local partners to understand the impact and spread of the outbreak in your area.
Designate staff who will be responsible for caring for suspected or known COVID-19 patients. Ensure they are trained on the infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19 and proper use of personal protective equipment.
Monitor healthcare workers and ensure maintenance of essential healthcare facility staff and operations:
Ensure staff are aware of sick leave policies and are encouraged to stay home if they are ill with respiratory symptoms.
Be aware of recommended work restrictions and monitoring based on staff exposure to COVID-19 patients.
Do not require a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick with respiratory symptoms before returning to work.
In settings of widespread transmission, your facility may consider screening staff for fever or respiratory symptoms before entering the facility.
When possible, manage mildly ill COVID-19 patients at home.
Assess the patient’s ability to engage in home monitoring, the ability for safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment.
Caregivers and sick persons should have clear instructions regarding home care and when and how to access the healthcare system for face-to-face care or urgent/emergency conditions.
Engage local public health, home health services, and community organizations to assist with support services (such as delivery of food, medication and other goods) for those treated at home.
Consider reaching out to patients who may be a higher risk of COVID-19-related complications (e.g., elderly, those with medical co-morbidities, and potentially other persons who are at higher risk for complications from respiratory diseases, such as pregnant women) to ensure adherence to current medications and therapeutic regimens, confirm they have sufficient medication refills, and provide instructions to notify their provider by phone if they become ill.
Consider accelerating the timing of high priority screening and intervention needs for the short-term, in anticipation of the possible need to manage an influx of COVID-19 patients in the weeks to come.
Limit visitors to COVID-19 patients.
Using alternate and separate spaces in the ER, ICUs, and other patient care areas to manage known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Separating known or suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients (“cohorting”).
Identifying dedicated staff to care for COVID-19 patients.
Ensure supplies are available (tissues, waste receptacles, alcohol-based hand sanitizer)
Take steps to prevent known or suspected COVID-19 patients from exposing other patients
Limit the movement of COVID-19 patients (e.g., have them remain in their room)
Identify dedicated staff to care for COVID-19 patients.
Observe newly arriving patients/residents for development of respiratory symptoms.
Shifting Healthcare Delivery Modes during a COVID-19 Outbreak in the United States
Several major impacts can be anticipated during a severe outbreak that could affect the operations of healthcare facilities.  These include surges in patients seeking care, the potential for workforce absenteeism from personal or family illness, and effects from social distancing measures such as school closures. Healthcare facilities will likely need to adjust the way they triage, assess and care for patients using methods that do not rely on face-to-face care.
Shifting practices to triaging and assessing ill patients (including those affected by COVID-19 and patients with other conditions) remotely using nurse advice lines, provider “visits” by telephone, text monitoring system, video conference, or other telehealth and telemedicine methods can reduce exposure of ill persons with staff and minimize surge on facilities. Many clinics and medical offices already use these methods to triage and manage patients after hours and as part of usual practices. Recent reports suggest that approximately 80% of COVID-19 patients (of all ages) have experienced mild illness[i]. Managing persons at home who are ill with mild disease can reduce the strain on healthcare systems—however, these patients will need careful triage and monitoring.
Promoting the increased use of telehealth
Healthcare facilities can increase the use of telephone management and other remote methods of triaging, assessing and caring for all patients to decrease the volume of persons seeking care in facilities.
If a formal “telehealth” system is not available, healthcare providers can still communicate with patients by telephone (instead of visits), reducing the number of those who seek face-to-face care.
Health plans, healthcare systems and insurers/payors should message beneficiaries to promote the availability of covered telehealth, telemedicine, or nurse advice line services
Shifts in the way that healthcare is delivered during a COVID-19 outbreak response will be complex. Thorough and consistent communications between all components of the public health and healthcare system will be needed in every community. For example, providers in medical offices, clinics, and other outpatient settings must be informed and know their roles.  Pre-hospital care by emergency management services (EMS) and public-safety answering points (PSAPs) will also need to be aware of any altered transport guidance so they can conduct in-home assessments and triage per local guidance.

Preparing for COVID-19: Long-term Care Facilities, Nursing Homes
A new respiratory disease – coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – is spreading globally and there have been instances of COVID-19 community spread in the United States. The general strategies CDC recommends to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in LTCF are the same strategies these facilities use every day to detect and prevent the spread of other respiratory viruses like influenza.
Symptoms of respiratory infection, including COVID-19:
Long-term care facilities concerned that a resident, visitor, or employee may be a COVID-2019 patient under investigation should contact their local or state health department immediately for consultation and guidance.
COVID-19 Preparedness Checklist for Nursing Homes and other Long-Term Care Settings
Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities can take steps to assess and improve their preparedness for responding to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This checklist should be used as one tool to develop a comprehensive COVID-19 response plan, including plans for:
Sick leave policies and other occupational health considerations
The checklist identiﬁes key areas that long-term care facilities should consider in their COVID-19 planning. Long-term care facilities can use this tool to self-assess the strengths and weaknesses of current preparedness efforts. This checklist does not describe mandatory requirements or standards; rather, it highlights important areas to review to prepare for the possibility of residents with COVID-19.
COVID-19 Preparedness Checklist for Nursing Homes and other Long-Term Care Settings
Interim Additional Guidance for Infection Prevention and Control for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 in Nursing Homes
Restrict all volunteers and non-essential healthcare personnel (HCP), including non-essential healthcare personnel (e.g., barbers)
Implement active screening of residents and HCP for fever and respiratory symptoms
COVID-19 is being increasingly reported in communities across the United States. It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will be identified in more communities, including areas where cases have not yet been reported. As such, nursing homes should assume it could already be in their community and move to restrict all visitors and unnecessary HCP from the facility; cancel group activities and communal dining; and implement active screening of residents and HCP for fever and respiratory symptoms.
Given their congregate nature and residents served (e.g., older adults often with underlying chronic medical conditions), nursing home populations are at the highest risk of being affected by COVID-19. If infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, residents are at increased risk of serious illness.
Ill visitors and healthcare personnel (HCP) are the most likely sources of introduction of COVID-19 into a facility. CDC recommends aggressive visitor restrictions and enforcing sick leave policies for ill HCP, even before COVID-19 is identified in a community or facility.
These recommendations supplement CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings. These recommendations are specific for nursing homes, including skilled nursing facilities. Much of this information could also be applied in assisted living facilities. This information complements, but does not replace, the general infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19.
This guidance is based on the currently available information about COVID-19. It will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States. It is important to understand transmission dynamics in your community to inform strategies to prevent introduction or spread of COVID-19 in your facility. Consultation with public health authorities can help you better understand if transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in your community.
See the COVID-19 Preparedness Checklist for Nursing Homes and Other Long-Term Care Settings.
Educate Residents, Healthcare Personnel, and Visitors
Review CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
information about COVID-19
Put alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60–95% alcohol in every resident room (ideally both inside and outside of the room) and other resident care and common areas (e.g., outside dining hall, in therapy gym).
respirators (if available and the facility has a respiratory protection program with trained, medically cleared, and fit-tested HCP)
Consider implementing a respiratory protection program that is compliant with the OSHA respiratory protection standard for employees if not already in place. The program should include medical evaluations, training, and fit testing.
Environmental cleaning and disinfection:
Make sure that EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectants are available to allow for frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces and shared resident care equipment.
on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2.
Refer to the Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Evaluate and Manage HCP with Symptoms of Respiratory Illness
Implement sick leave policies that are non-punitive, flexible, and consistent with public health policies that allow ill HCP to stay home.
As part of routine practice, ask HCP (including consultant personnel) to regularly monitor themselves for fever and symptoms of respiratory infection.
If HCP develop fever or symptoms of respiratory infection while at work, they should immediately put on a facemask, inform their supervisor, and leave the workplace.
Consult occupational health on decisions about further evaluation and return to work.
Screen all HCP at the beginning of their shift for fever and respiratory symptoms.
HCP who work in multiple locations may pose higher risk and should be asked about exposure to facilities with recognized COVID-19 cases.
Restrict nonessential healthcare personnel (including consultant personnel) and volunteers for entering the building.
Refer to the Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19.
Because of the ease of spread in a long-term care setting and the severity of illness that occurs in residents with COVID-19, facilities should immediately restrict all visitation to their facilities except certain compassionate care situations, such as end of life situations.
Decisions about visitation during an end of life situation should be made on a case by case basis, which should include careful screening of the visitor for fever or respiratory symptoms. Those with symptoms should not be permitted to enter the facility. Those visitors that are permitted must wear a facemask while in the building and restrict their visit to the resident’s room or other location designated by the facility. They should also be reminded to frequently perform hand hygiene.
Resources for Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19
Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Evaluate and Manage Residents with Symptoms of Respiratory Infection
Ask residents to report if they feel feverish or have symptoms of respiratory infection.
Actively monitor all residents upon admission and at least daily for fever and respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, new or change in cough, and sore throat).
If positive for fever or symptoms, implement recommended IPC practices.
The health department should be notified about residents with severe respiratory infection, or a cluster (e.g., >3 residents or HCP with new-onset respiratory symptoms over 72 hours) of residents or HCP with symptoms of respiratory infections.
See State-Based Prevention Activitiesfor contact information for the healthcare-associated infections program in each state health department.
[PDF – 246 KB]during an outbreak.
In general, when caring for residents with undiagnosed respiratory infection use Standard, Contact, and Droplet Precautions with eye protection unless the suspected diagnosis requires Airborne Precautions (e.g., tuberculosis).  This includes restricting residents with respiratory infection to their rooms. If they leave the room, residents should wear a facemask (if tolerated) or use tissues to cover their mouth and nose.
If COVID-19 is suspected, based on evaluation of the resident or prevalence of COVID-19 in the community,
Residents with known or suspected COVID-19 do not need to be placed into an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) but should ideally be placed in a private room with their own bathroom.
Room sharing might be necessary if there are multiple residents with known or suspected COVID-19 in the facility. As roommates of symptomatic residents might already be exposed, it is generally not recommended to separate them in this scenario. Public health authorities can assist with decisions about resident placement.
Facilities should notify the health department immediately and follow the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings, which includes detailed information regarding recommended PPE.
While awaiting transfer, symptomatic residents should wear a facemask (if tolerated) and be separated from others (e.g., kept in their room with the door closed). Appropriate PPE should be used by healthcare personnel when coming in contact with the resident.
Remind residents to practice social distancing and perform frequent hand hygiene.
Create a plan for cohorting residents with symptoms of respiratory infection, including dedicating HCP to work only on affected units.
Healthcare Personnel Monitoring and Restrictions
Healthcare Personnel Monitoring and Restrictions:
Consider having HCP wear all recommended PPE (gown, gloves, eye protection, N95 respirator or, if not available, a facemask) for the care of all residents, regardless of presence of symptoms. Implement protocols for extended use of eye protection and facemasks.
Encourage residents to remain in their room. If there are cases in the facility, restrict residents (to the extent possible) to their rooms except for medically necessary purposes.
If they leave their room, residents should wear a facemask, perform hand hygiene, limit their movement in the facility, and perform social distancing (stay at least 6 feet away from others).

Establishing alternative care sites will help address surge in the response to COVID-19.
A local surge in the need for medical care may require jurisdictions to establish alternative (or alternate) care sites (ACS), which are intended to allow healthcare providers to provide care in non-traditional environments, such as converted public buildings or mobile field medical units.1
This guidance provides critical infection prevention and control (IPC) considerations for ACS and is intended to supplement existing ACS plans (created by jurisdictions as part of pandemic planning).
The following information is for ACS providing care to adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, but the patient:
Does not require the level of care available at an acute care hospital, and
Nursing home residents who have COVID-19 and need to be moved out of the facility
People with COVID-19 in the general population who cannot return to their place of residence for social reasons (e.g., there are elderly relatives in the home)
Patients with COVID-19 who are currently hospitalized but can be discharged to a lower level of care
People with COVID-19 who are currently experiencing homelessness and cannot be discharged to a congregate setting
Tier two: ACS houses a cohort of patients who require some level of assistance (e.g., help with ADLs or medications) and who need a closer level of monitoring than patients in tier one. These patients may be better suited in a facility that has an open layout (e.g., school gymnasium) to allow limited numbers of healthcare personnel to more easily monitor their status.
This guidance does not address a third tier of ACS that would provide more advanced care to patients (e.g., continuous IV therapy) or care for both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients. These scenarios would require additional IPC and staffing considerations.  For example, if the ACS provided care to both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients planning would need to address  maintaining physical separation between the different patient cohorts and assigning dedicate personnel to work in each area.
This guidance identifies some key considerations for IPC in ACS. However, it does not address other important aspects of ACS, including patient transportation to and from nearby healthcare facilities. Jurisdictions should consider how close the ACS is to nearby healthcare facilities, including acute care hospitals, and may need to have agreements in place with surrounding healthcare facilities regarding patient transfer.
Dirty storage would have space for medical and non-medical waste and dirty equipment waiting to be reprocessed

Interim Additional Guidance for Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 in Outpatient Hemodialysis Facilities
These recommendations should be used with the CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings. This information is provided to clarify COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) recommendations that are specific to outpatient hemodialysis facilities. This information complements, but does not replace, the general IPC recommendations for COVID-19.
This guidance is based on the currently available information about COVID-19. This approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States. It is important to stay informed about COVID-19 to prevent introduction and minimize spread of COVID-19 in your dialysis facility. Consult with public health authorities to understand if community transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in your community.
COVID-19 Outpatient Dialysis Facility Preparedness Assessment Tool
Early recognition and isolation of individuals with respiratory infection:
Facilities should implement sick leave policies that are non-punitive, flexible and consistent with public health policies that allow ill healthcare personnel (HCP) to stay home. HCP should be reminded to not report to work when they are ill.
Facilities should identify patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection (e.g., fever, cough) before they enter the treatment area.
Instruct patients to call ahead to report fever or respiratory symptoms so the facility can be prepared for their arrival or triage them to a more appropriate setting (e.g., an acute care hospital).
Patients should inform staff of fever or respiratory symptoms immediately upon arrival at the facility (e.g., when they check in at the registration desk).
Patients with symptoms of a respiratory infection should put on a facemask at check-in and keep it on until they leave the facility.
Post signs at clinic entrances with instructions for patients with fever or symptoms of respiratory infection to alert staff so appropriate precautions can be implemented.
Facilities should have supplies positioned close to dialysis chairs and nursing stations to ensure adherence to hand and respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. These include tissues and no-touch receptacles for disposal of tissues and hand hygiene supplies (e.g., alcohol-based hand sanitizer).
Patient placement: Facilities should have space in waiting areas for ill patients to sit separated from other patients by at least 6 feet. Medically stable patients might opt to wait in a personal vehicle or outside the healthcare facility where they can be contacted by mobile phone when it is their turn to be seen.
Patients with respiratory symptoms should be brought back to an appropriate treatment area as soon as possible in order to minimize time in waiting areas.
Hepatitis B isolation rooms should only be used for dialysis patients with symptoms of respiratory infection if: 1) the patient is hepatitis B surface antigen positive or 2) the facility has no patients on the census with hepatitis B infection who would require treatment in the isolation room.
Personal protective equipment: In general, HCP caring for patients with undiagnosed respiratory infections should follow Standard, Contact, and Droplet Precautions with eye protection unless the suspected diagnosis requires Airborne Precautions (e.g., tuberculosis). This includes the use of:
Isolation gown
The isolation gown should be worn over or instead of the cover gown (i.e., laboratory coat, gown, or apron with incorporate sleeves) that is normally worn by hemodialysis personnel. If there are shortages of gowns, they should be prioritized for initiating and terminating dialysis treatment, manipulating access needles or catheters, helping the patient into and out of the station, and cleaning and disinfection of patient care equipment and the dialysis station.
When COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed in a patient receiving hemodialysis at the facility, the following additional measures apply:
The health department should be notified about the patient.
HCP should follow the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings. This includes recommendations on PPE. Routine cleaning and disinfection are appropriate for COVID-19 in dialysis settings. Any surface, supplies, or equipment (e.g., dialysis machine) located within 6 feet of symptomatic patients should be disinfected or discarded.
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are recommended for use against COVID-19. Refer to List Nexternal icon
 on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program from use against SARS-CoV-2.
If a hemodialysis facility is dialyzing more than one patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, consideration should be given to cohorting these patients and the HCP caring for them together in the section of the unit and/or on the same shift (e.g., consider the last shift of the day). If the etiology of respiratory symptoms is known, patients with different etiologies should not be cohorted (for example, patients with confirmed influenza and COVID-19 should not be cohorted).

Screening Dialysis Patients for COVID-19
Screen Patients for COVID-19 at Intake
To limit the spread of COVID-19, it is important to promptly identify, separate, and put facemasks on those patients who are ill. Screening patients before they enter the facility:
Reduces exposures for other patients and healthcare personnel
Helps prevent the spread of disease within the facility
Screen Patients for COVID-19 at Intake
Facilities should make sure triage procedures are compliant with HIPAA guidance and consider a multi-step screening process to ensure patients with symptoms are not missed prior to entering the treatment area. While the process for screening depends on facility layout and staffing, the general steps include:
Instruct patients to notify the facility before arriving if they have fever or respiratory symptoms
Consider using automated communications to remind patients about reporting symptoms (e.g., texts on their dialysis day or robocalls)
If they have symptoms, they should discuss them with a healthcare provider before arriving
Advanced notice gives the facility time to prepare for the patient’s arrival or, if indicated based on symptoms, to refer them to a higher level of care
Ask all patients upon entry to the facility if they have a fever, respiratory symptoms including cough or shortness of breath, sore throat, or systemic symptoms like myalgias or chills
Place a staff member near all entrances (outdoors if weather and facility layout permit), or in the waiting room area, to ensure patients are screened for symptoms and fever before entering the treatment floor.
Send patients to the appropriate waiting areas, which should be organized to divide patients with symptoms from patients without symptoms
Separate patients by at least 6 feet, and the area for patients with symptoms should be at least 6 feet away from the area for patients without symptoms
Post alerts such as signs and posters at clinic entrances and in strategic places around the facility with instructions for patients with fever or symptoms of respiratory infection
Facilities should make sure staff members who are screening patients remain 6 feet away from the patient until screening determines a patient is symptom-free and afebrile (temperature ascertained by patient report or active temperature monitoring). If there is widespread community transmission of COVID-19, facilities can consider instituting active temperature monitoring by having a staff member check the patient’s temperature immediately upon arrival at the door and when the patient is first asked about symptoms.
If patient reports not having symptoms and no fever is detected (by patient report or on active temperature monitoring if performed), they can be directed to a waiting room area for patients without symptoms. No mask is required.
If patient needs urgent care, immediately notify healthcare provider for further clinical management and to determine if a higher level of care is needed.
If patient reports having symptoms or fever is detected (by patient report or on active temperature monitoring if performed):
Allowing symptomatic patients to wait in a personal vehicle or outside the facility until their treatment time, if medically stable
Immediately after departure of the symptomatic patient from waiting area, disinfect surfaces that were within 6 feet of the symptomatic patient
Items that cannot be disinfected, such as magazines and other paper materials, should remain with the patient or be discarded
This is in addition to the regular (frequent) baseline cleaning and disinfection process that should be occurring for the entire waiting area

Steps Healthcare Facilities Can Take Now to Prepare for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
The true impact of a COVID-19 outbreak in a U.S. community cannot be predicted. However, all healthcare facilities can take steps now to prepare for such an outbreak and protect both their patients and staff.
Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Know where to turn for reliable, up-to-date information in your local community. Monitor the CDC COVID-19 website and your state and local health department websites
Develop, or review, your facility’s emergency plan. A COVID-19 outbreak in your community could lead to staff absenteeism. Prepare alternative staffing plans to ensure as many of your facility’s staff are available as possible.
Establish relationships with key healthcare and public health partners in your community. Make sure you know about healthcare and public health emergency planning and response activities in your community. Learn about plans to manage patients, accept transfers, and share supplies. Review any memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with affiliates, your healthcare coalition, and other partners to provide support or assistance during emergencies.
Create an emergency contact list. Develop and continuously update emergency contact lists for key partners and ensure the lists are accessible in key locations in your facility. For example, know how to reach your local or state health department in an emergency.
Communicate about COVID-19 with your staff. Share information about what is currently known about COVID-19, the potential for surge, and your facility’s preparedness plans.
Communicate about COVID-19 with your patients. Provide updates about changes to your policies regarding appointments, providing non-urgent patient care by telephone, and visitors. Consider using your facility’s website or social media pages to share updates.
Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing) before entering your healthcare facility. Keep up to date on the recommendations for preventing spread of COVID-19 on CDC’s website.
Ensure proper use of personal protection equipment (PPE). Healthcare personnel who come in close contact with confirmed or possible patients with COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment.
Encourage sick employees to stay home. Personnel who develop respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) should be instructed not to report to work. Ensure that your sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of these policies.
Stay up-to-date on the best ways to manage patients with COVID-19.
Separate patients with respiratory symptoms so they are not waiting among other patients seeking care. Identify a separate, well-ventilated space that allows waiting patients and visitors to be separated.
Using your telephone system to deliver messages to incoming callers about when to seek medical care at your facility, when to seek emergency care, and where to go for information about caring for a person with COVID at home.
Adjusting your hours of operation to include telephone triage and follow-up of patients during a community outbreak.

Public Health Reminder
Healthcare facilities and clinicians should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures now and for the coming several weeks. The following actions can preserve staff, personal protective equipment, and patient care supplies; ensure staff and patient safety; and expand available hospital capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic:
exist as part of healthcare system preparedness plans and are often referred to as Pandemic Plans. Consult your state or local health department about specific plans for your community.
Search for specific COVID-19 guidance across CDC web pages and documents
Maintaining Childhood Immunizations During COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic is changing rapidly and continues to affect communities across the United States differently. Some of the strategies used to slow the spread of disease in communities include postponing or cancelling non-urgent elective procedures and using telemedicine instead of face-to-face encounters for routine medical visits.
Ensuring the delivery of newborn and well-child care, including childhood immunization, requires different strategies. Healthcare providers in communities affected by COVID-19 are using strategies to separate well visits from sick visits
Because of personal, practice, or community circumstances related to COVID-19, some providers may not be able to provide well child visits, including provision of  immunizations, for all patients in their practice. If a practice can provide only limited well child visits, healthcare providers are encouraged to prioritize newborn care and vaccination of infants and young children (through 24 months of age) when possible. CDC is monitoring the situation and will continue to provide guidance.

Coronavirus-Themed Party at Albany Draws Criticism
  Evidence of a coronavirus-themed party has sparked controversy at the University at Albany, of the State University of New York, The Democrat and Chronicle reported Thursday. A since-deleted video of off-campus party, which featured Corona Extra beer, surgical masks and a white sheet decorated with a biohazard symbol, appeared on the Instagram account @BarstoolAlbany last weekend with the caption, “Corona virus isn't gonna stop anyone from partying.”
Albany’s Asian American Alliance issued a statement over Instagram, saying the party was insensitive and not funny. “The real life affects [sic] of this virus has not only led to mass stereotyping of Asian people, but also hundreds of deaths around the world,” the statement read. The virus has caused over 2,300 deaths so far, mostly in China.
“The Office of the President shall inform all UAlbany students to stop racism and disrespectful slogans in any situation,” the alliance demanded, “especially coronavirus hate crime against Asian American students and scholars based on groundless suspicion of virus hosts.”

LIVE UPDATES: How higher education is reacting to the new coronavirus pandemic.
March 28, 4:45 p.m. The mayor of New Haven, Conn., Justin Elicker, yesterday criticized Yale University for declining to make a residence hall available to city police officers and firefighters who may have been exposed to the coronavirus, either directly or through contact with family members. Yale said its student housing facilities were not ready for new occupants and still contained students' possessions.
Peter Salovey, Yale's president, said this afternoon that the university would make 300 beds and expedited testing for COVID-19 available to the city's first responders. Salovey's statement follows.
"Yesterday, New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker expressed frustration with Yale University’s lack of a swift positive response to his request for the university to provide housing for first responders to COVID-19.
Toward that end, we will make 300 beds available by the end of this coming week to first responders and hospital personnel.
Furthermore, we have been working with first responders to make expedited COVID-19 testing in Yale laboratories available to responders who have been exposed to patients.
Additionally, on Thursday we announced a $5 million Yale Community for New Haven Fund to help address the consequences of the epidemic in New Haven.
Now more than ever, Yale and City Hall need to be on the same page. I know how committed all of us across the city and the university are to implementing an effective response to COVID-19, and I will do all I can to support this shared work."
N.Y. Eases Requirements for Health-Care Workers
March 28, 1:24 p.m. New York State has temporarily suspended a wide range of licensing and other requirements for health-care workers in an attempt to mobilize more help in dealing with the pandemic.
Under the executive order from Andrew Cuomo, the state's Democratic governor, students in academic programs for health-care fields are now able to volunteer in medical facilities and receive educational credit. The order also drops certain record-keeping requirements for health-care workers.
In addition, New York's health commissioner for one year can modify examination or recertification requirements for emergency medical services providers.
The state also said a regulation to "allow graduates of foreign medical schools having at least one year of graduate medical education to provide patient care in hospitals" now "is modified so as to allow such graduates without licenses to provide patient care in hospitals if they have completed at least one year of graduate medical education."
March 28, 11:07 a.m. Justin Elicker, the mayor of New Haven, Conn., said Yale University declined a request from the city for the use of a residence hall by asymptomatic city police officers and firefighters, the New Haven Register reported.
The city wanted the Yale residence hall for police officers and firefighters who had been exposed to the coronavirus or have family members who were exposed. Elicker said Friday in a virtual news conference that Peter Salovey, Yale's president, said no to the request. Elicker then called Steve Kaplan, president of the University of New Haven, who, he said, granted the request within five minutes.
Our student rooms still contain their belongings, but we have teams planning the feasibility of packing and storing all the student belongings so that the rooms could be utilized. We are pursuing schemes that involve professional movers and packers, and using temporary storage. The process will take weeks, as all of the residence hall rooms on campus are filled with student belongings. As soon as we have been able to clear any space, we have informed the mayor that we will let him know. We all wish the situation on our campus were different, but because our students had already gone home for spring recess when we implemented our social distancing restrictions, the rooms aren’t ready for others to live in them.
The curfew will start on Sunday at 10 p.m. and last through April 11, at which point the city will re-evaluate the curfew. Walt Maddox, the mayor, said briefings with doctors and researchers showed an "imminent threat" to the city's health-care system, according to AL.com.
The university already had extended its spring break and asked students not to return to campus as the coronavirus spread.
March 27, 3:00 p.m. The Association of Research Libraries on Friday urged publishers to “maximize access to digital content during the emergency conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Earlier this week, the association signed a statement by the International Coalition of Library Consortia asking publishers to ease any simultaneous usage and interlibrary loan restrictions on subscription-based content. In a separate statement, the ARL said that opening up academic resources ensures students can continue their studies, and “scholars can continue their research and work to end the pandemic. As research library leaders, our member representatives understand that innovation, particularly in emergencies at a global scale, often happens at disciplinary intersections.”
As to research on COVID-19, the association pushed publishers to adopt an “expansive view” of research materials -- think articles, book chapters, multimedia and data -- “as they temporarily remove paywalls and create open resource portals related to the virus.” Topic-wise, the ARL advised opening up research on respiration, crisis and disaster management and response, clinical psychology, and other areas. More generally, 50 university presses already opened content on Johns Hopkins University Press’s Project MUSE for the rest of the academic year.
The lawsuit alleges that the University of Arizona, Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University have refused to refund the cost of room, board and other campus fees for the spring semester after the coronavirus outbreak forced campuses to close.
The Board of Regents recently announced that classes would be moved online due to the global health pandemic and encouraged students to move out of their campus residences.
March 26, 2:15 p.m. The House on Friday approved a massive $2 trillion coronavirus relief package, and President Trump signed it into law a few hours later. The measures will pay as much as $1,200 apiece to adults, increase unemployment benefits and provide loans to businesses.
The bill, passed by the Senate Wednesday night, also provides $14 billion in funding for higher education institutions, half of which must be used for emergency grants to help students affected by the crisis.
But, Barba said, “today’s coronavirus bill is a life raft -- but not a rescue boat -- for the millions of young people who are still grappling with how they will make ends meet as they navigate challenges like unemployment, student loan debt and paying their daily expenses.”
“Congress must do more in the weeks ahead to bolster the resources and protections provided to students, researchers, universities, laboratories, hospitals, and medical professionals,” Association of American Universities president Mary Sue Coleman said in a statement after the vote.
The NCAA announced yesterday that Division III’s revenue allocation from the association for fiscal year 2019-20 will be $22.3 million less than it was last year, as a result of losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. A Division III committee on strategic planning and finance decided on Tuesday to cancel several student and staff development programs and conferences to cut down on costs for the remainder of the year, an NCAA press release said.
Tisch students have been advocating for a partial refund of tuition, arguing the forced switch to remote learning due to the coronavirus pandemic won't provide the same level of education for drama and the arts that in-person instruction would have.
“But if the goal is to relieve hardship among families struggling with student debt, one option is to enact a one-time automatic rehabilitation of all defaulted loans, which would give a fresh start to defaulted borrowers at the end of the health emergency," said Chingos. "Congress could eliminate the fees and capitalized interest added to defaulted loans, effectively giving defaulted borrowers a second chance to pay what they would owe if they hadn’t defaulted."
March 26, 6:00 p.m. A coalition of attorneys general is calling on the U.S. Department of Education to provide emergency relief for federal student loan borrowers.
“Thousands of New Yorkers and millions more across the country were already struggling with student loan debt prior to the coronavirus, but today, the financial hardship many face is more severe as a result of business closures, lost wages, and job losses,” James said in a statement. “Borrowers need immediate relief and cannot wait for a stimulus package to pass through Congress which is why our coalition is calling on the Department of Education to take immediate action and protect student loan borrowers. Any stimulus relief should be weighed separately and should not be used as an excuse to deprive borrowers what they need. Secretary [Betsy] DeVos has the power to help millions or ensure they are [not] left with billions in insurmountable debt.”
Yesterday, DeVos announced the department will stop collection actions and garnishing the wages of borrowers who are behind on their student loan payments. That order is effective for at least 60 days during the coronavirus outbreak.
Nearly $800 million -- most of the NCAA’s revenue -- comes from the Division I men’s basketball March Madness tournament, which was canceled two weeks ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. The $225 million to be given to Division I institutions in June will be made up of $50 million from NCAA reserves, and the remaining funds will come from credit lines to be paid off by a $270 million event cancellation insurance policy. The NCAA will also undergo a “variety of cost-cutting budget measures,” the press release said.
The NCAA has prepared for such revenue losses, said Michael Drake, chair of its Board of Governors and president of Ohio State University. The pandemic is a “financial catastrophic event,” he said.
March 26, 3 p.m. Ohio University is pausing personnel-related budget cuts because of the coronavirus.
Enrollment has been down at the university, but Nellis said in a letter to faculty, staff and leadership that the situation is being reassessed in light of the public health pandemic.
West Florida provided the estimated cost of all refunds after yesterday announcing details about prorated rooming refunds in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. It is providing refunds based on flat rates that vary by the type of housing unit in which students lived.
The university cites guidance from Larry Hogan, governor of Maryland, and public health experts for the decision in a news release.
Originally, students who wished to return to campus to get their belongings and officially move out were told to come to campus between March 27 and April 5. But it's not clear if doing so would go against public health recommendations to maximize social distancing, the release states.
Residents who are still living on campus are asked to continue with their move-out plans following public health and travel guidelines if it is safe for them to do so. Students who were approved for emergency on-campus housing starting April 5 can remain in residence halls.
Repercussions of the depression-level spike will be felt broadly across higher education, experts said. Colleges and universities themselves have begun to struggle as broad swaths of the economy have been shut down amid social-distancing efforts to blunt the pandemic. Many are freezing new hires, cutting pay or laying off staff members, particularly contract workers. More such actions, including furloughs, are likely in coming weeks.
The funding will help historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges and universities, and other minority-serving institutions cover the operational costs of responding to the coronavirus pandemic. The costs include transitioning from in-person, on-campus instruction to distance and online options, assisting some students with the costs of moving off-campus and returning home, keeping residential halls open for those who cannot go home, and ensuring that campus buildings are safe and free of the virus. All those costs "put a tremendous unforeseen financial strain on institutions that have historically been underfunded," according to the United Negro College Fund.
“I want to thank the congressional leadership for responding to our call and the needs of HBCUs, and indeed the rest of the higher education community,” UNCF president and CEO Michael L. Lomax said in a prepared statement. “I call on the House and Senate to swiftly pass this legislation. Also, let me be clear: the COVID-19 pandemic is hitting HBCUs hard. All emergencies that hit the higher education system seem to hit HBCUs harder because we serve mostly Pell Grant-eligible students.”
March 25, 4:40 p.m. The University of Maine system is estimating that refunding room and board to students who are no longer living on campus because of the coronavirus outbreak will cost $12.85 million.
That’s about 2.3 percent of the university’s total revenue budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, which is $553 million. Pressure to issue room and board refunds is one important source of financial stress for colleges and universities scrambling to protect students from the pandemic by sending them home and transitioning classes to remote or online instruction. But it has remained unclear exactly how much refunds will cost most institutions, as many have been crunching the numbers.
“Today’s resumption of classes will be unlike anything before in the history of our universities,” Dannel Malloy, chancellor of the University of Maine system, said in a news release. “The transition to distance instruction and 95% reduction in our on-campus population were necessary to protect community health and help blunt the spread of the virus.”
March 25, 4:20 p.m. Citing impacts and uncertainties tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, S&P Global Ratings today moved its outlook to negative for private student housing projects connected to U.S. colleges and universities.
“Given this and the lack of clarity around the possible duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, in our opinion, fall 2020 enrollment at U.S. colleges and universities will likely be weaker than expected, and occupancy in privatized student housing projects could be negatively affected,” the ratings agency said in a news release.
The financial crisis isn’t being caused by whether companies are doing well, either, Berk said. Rather, the market is reflecting the impact of the health pandemic. The way to fix that is to stop the spread of the coronavirus and find a vaccine for it.
“Every dollar that’s taken away from supporting investors and United Airlines and put into families and into our medical system to make sure that we beat this crisis is going to serve us much better in the long run,” said Paul Pfleiderer, professor of finance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
When asked about whether the United States could see a “double dip” pandemic if the administration calls for an end to social distancing too soon, the professors said they are worried.
“We’re seeing a fragility of the economy” due to corporations loading up on cheap debt, said Anat Admati, professor of finance and economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “The consequences of ignoring health experts are dire for everybody -- for both people and the economy.”
March 25, 2:36 p.m. Betsy DeVos, the U.S. education secretary, announced the department will stop collection actions and garnishing the wages of borrowers who are behind on their student loan payments. The order is in effect for at least 60 days during the coronavirus outbreak.
"These are difficult times for many Americans, and we don't want to do anything that will make it harder for them to make ends meet or create additional stress," DeVos said in a statement. "Americans counting on their tax refund or Social Security check to make ends meet during this national emergency should receive those funds, and our actions today will make sure they do."
March 25, 2:25 p.m. The president of the umbrella association representing colleges and universities said the amount of aid for higher education institutions included in the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill headed to a vote in the Senate is “woefully inadequate.”
While the bill is still being finalized and education lobbyists are reviewing the mammoth document, a summary of the proposal said it includes $30.75 billion in grants to “provide emergency support to local school systems and higher education institutions to continue to provide educational services to their students.” That amount appears to be about $29 billion less than what higher education institutions could potentially get in the bill proposed by House Democrats, but $21 billion more than what Senate Republicans had initially proposed, one higher education lobbyist said.
Early Graduation for NYU Medical Students
March 25, 1:10 p.m. New York University's Grossman School of Medicine is allowing some medical students to graduate early to help in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
Students in the graduating Class of 2020 who meet completion requirements will be able to start working as early as April, according to Brief19, a medical news outlet on the coronavirus started by physicians, which obtained a copy of the dean's letter to students.
The dean told students they would be fully compensated if they elect to graduate early, according to Brief19, and the offer is open for students studying any field of medicine. The intent is to relieve front-line health workers in New York who are working overtime to treat those with COVID-19.
But according to summaries of the bill making the rounds among education advocacy groups and obtained by Inside Higher Ed, the measure will also include changes sought by advocates such as not requiring Pell Grant students to repay money to the federal government if their terms are disrupted by the coronavirus emergency.
A separate summary contains $30.75 billion in grants to “provide emergency support to local school systems and higher education institutions to continue to provide educational services to their students and support.” That amount appears be about $29 billion less than what higher education institutions could potentially get in the bill proposed by House Democrats, but $21 billion more than what Senate Republicans had initially proposed, one higher education lobbyist said. Associations representing institutions that were disappointed with the previous proposals were still waiting for the full bill before they commented on the level of funding.
"After reviewing the job duties of employees who are required to work from home, the university concluded that the work performed by some of its employees is not amenable to working remotely," LIU Post said in a statement to the newspaper. "Accordingly, LIU has reluctantly decided to temporarily lay off a small percentage of its workforce for the next 30 days. The university has committed to making no further adjustments during this period."
A growing number of colleges and universities have announced pay cuts and hiring freezes amid the initial financial hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Quinnipiac University this week cut pay for faculty and staff members. And the University of Bridgeport recently said a budget deficit and the pandemic’s impact will lead to staff cuts.
I extend my most sincere thanks, that of IU’s senior leadership and that of the IU Trustees to all our faculty who are working with such breakneck speed to transform their courses to all virtual instruction. Our most sincere thanks to all our staff who provide the myriad support services that are making this transformation possible. Our most sincere thanks to all the staff who are keeping as much as possible of the normal business of the university operating. And our special thanks to all those at the front lines of this fight — those responsible for cleaning and sanitizing of the university, the police and other public safety officials, and our health care workers who are working with those who have or have been exposed to COVID-19. To all of you we express our most grateful thanks.
The university said the decision is due to the coronavirus pandemic, the New Haven Independent reported.
“The far-reaching disruptions caused by Covid-19 have resulted in significant additional expenses for our university and lost revenues from programs that were canceled. In addition, the pandemic creates uncertainty in our future enrollment projections,” Judy Olian, president of Quinnipiac, wrote in an email to faculty and staff, according to the Independent. “Accordingly, we are taking measured steps now to address our financial reality.”
March 24, 2:35 p.m. A Democratic aide tells Inside Higher Ed the $10,000 debt cancellation Democrats in the House and Senate wanted as part of the coronavirus rescue legislation is not a viable option. A smaller form of cancellation is possible, the aide said.
The public university's Board of Trustees cited issues stemming from the novel coronavirus in their proclamation, which was first reported on Twitter by Dan Bauman, a reporter at The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The board anticipates that the measures the university took to prevent the spread of the virus, such as canceling in-person classes and closing the campus to the public, will lead to a drop in enrollment and retention. The absence of people on campus will lead to a drop in revenue for auxiliary services. Event cancellations will also hurt the university.
The loss of economic activity and tax revenue for the state from the pandemic also is likely to lead to less funding for public institutions, the board's letter said.
Harvard's President Tests Positive
March 24, 1 p.m. The president of Harvard University has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The couple began experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 on Sunday. They've been working from home and practicing social distancing since March 14, according to the letter, and are unsure how they caught the virus.
"This virus can lay anyone low. We all need to be vigilant and keep following guidelines to limit our contact with others," Bacow wrote. "Your swift actions over the past few weeks -- to respond to the needs of our community, to fulfill our teaching mission and to pursue research that will save lives -- have moved me deeply and made me extraordinarily grateful and proud."
COVID-19 Death at New York's International House
March 24, 11:43 a.m. A resident of International House -- a living-learning community in New York City connected with Columbia University -- died Saturday of complications of COVID-19, and International House reported today that another member of its community had tested positive for COVID-19 and “has been recovering without complications outside the premises for over two weeks.” International House also said a staff member tested positive several weeks ago and is also recovering at home without complications.
March 24, 11:20 a.m. Colleges and universities are hoping to see a Republican proposal to encourage more charitable donations during the coronavirus crisis included in the mammoth stimulus package being negotiated in Congress.
While classes are being taught online, Liberty is opening up campus for students who wish to return to their residence halls, according to a news release. Faculty members also are expected to hold office hours, but they can file requests for accommodations if they feel they are at higher risk for contracting and recovering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The Virginia Department of Health sent an inspector for a surprise visit to the campus after the governor announced the 10-person limit, according to the news release. The university was found to be in compliance with all restrictions.
Annex I, a former hotel owned by Liberty, is being used to quarantine those with symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Yet, the rapidly changing circumstances, even as recently as this weekend, made us question whether our vision of a safe-haven virtual environment could be realized,” Levine and Walker wrote. “We have been monitoring the coronavirus disease, now sweeping the United States, over the last week to assess whether our vision of a free, open-access Virtual Annual Meeting for all would continue to provide the safe and secure space for participants and attendees we had imagined, or whether it was adding to a ‘to do’ list growing exponentially for far too many.”
"The impact of COVID-19 on the state, its economy, and budget and finances is unpredictable and rapidly changing, but the state believes that events surrounding COVID-19 will negatively impact the state’s economy and financial condition," Muoio said. "The actual impact of COVID-19 on the state, its economy and its budget and finances will heavily depend on future events, including future events outside of the control of the state, and actions by the federal government as well as nations across the world."
March 23, 5:50 p.m. The American Indian Higher Education Consortium is asking its members to advocate for special funding to help tribal colleges mitigate the coronavirus pandemic.
"With the spread of COVID-19, TCUs and TCU students are faced with tremendous, disruptive change. We need to secure our campuses, move to online learning, and create safe spaces and opportunities to learn at a distance," the release states. "Yet TCUs have the worst internet access, at the highest average cost, when compared to all other colleges and universities in the United States. TCUs educate more enrolled American Indians and Alaska Natives than any other postsecondary education institutions in the U.S. -- and our students need and deserve equitable resources."
Current proposals include emergency aid, but only a limited amount for tribal colleges, according to the release.
Like the Senate Democratic plan, House Democrats proposed for the federal government to cover monthly student loan payments for borrowers, as long as a national emergency declaration over the coronavirus epidemic continues. And the payments would reduce the balances of what borrowers owe.
In addition, another $9.5 billion, including $1.5 billion for historically black colleges and universities, would be distributed through as-yet-undetermined grant process to reimburse institutions for coronavirus-related costs.
Coronavirus Call Centers
March 23, 3:45 p.m. Got questions about coronavirus? Some colleges are starting call centers to provide answers for students, parents and staff members.
Purdue University is launching its call center today to provide information on what COVID-19 means for the university in Indiana, from housing to financial aid to academics. University employees will staff the center Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m.
Colleges, Organizations Offer Emergency Aid to Students
March 23, 3:20 p.m. Colleges and universities are offering emergency funds to students in light of the spread of a novel coronavirus.
The Northern Virginia Community College Educational Foundation launched a new emergency aid fund for students affected by the pandemic with a $250,000 contribution from the NOVA Foundation. More than half of NOVA's students work in full- or part-time jobs, many of which are now at risk as the country enters a recession.
“Ensuring every NOVA student succeeds is our highest priority always,” Anne Kress, NOVA's president, said in a news release. “But especially now, as our students face unprecedented challenges, we have an obligation to ensure they have our support. Our students will help our community rebuild and prosper but they can only do this if we provide the assistance they need. I encourage everyone to consider donating to the Emergency Student Aid Fund.”
Temple University in Philadelphia also is offering emergency aid funds for students who apply, as well as partnering with community groups to offer services like food pantries, according to The Temple News.
Several organizations have partnered to start the Student Relief Fund, which has so far raised $95,000 to help students whose lives were affected by COVID-19.
March 23, 2:20 p.m. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said House Democrats will propose slightly more aid for higher education institutions than Republicans proposed in the Senate. While short on details, Pelosi said in a statement that the House Democratic proposal "pumps nearly $40 billion into schools and universities, with $30 billion directly provided to states to help them stabilize their funding for schools and nearly $10 billion to help alleviate the harm caused by coronavirus on higher education institutions, while providing them with added flexibility to continue operating during the crisis."
It’s unclear how much support the proposal has even among House Democrats. Politico reported on Sunday that Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin she wants a package dealing with the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak to include at least $10,000 in debt cancellation.
Amy Klobuchar's Husband Tests Positive
March 23, 1 p.m. John Bessler, a professor and husband of Amy Klobuchar, the U.S. senator and former Democratic presidential candidate, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19.
He is now at a hospital in Virginia and is on oxygen but is not on a ventilator.
"I love my husband so very much and not being able to be there at the hospital by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease," Klobuchar said in her statement.
March 23, 12:35 p.m. Southern New Hampshire University on Monday unveiled a suite of free resources in light of the novel coronavirus, including modules on how to run a drive-through COVID-19 test site.
The private nonprofit college is offering online trainings and education resources for educators, front-line workers and health-care workers, according to a news release.
One of the microcredentials offered is targeted at health-care workers, like retail pharmacy technicians, volunteer health-care workers and EMTs. The free training will teach those workers how to operate drive-through testing sites for the virus.
“The spread of COVID-19 has shown us the critical importance of collaboration and helping those in need,” Paul LeBlanc, president and CEO of the university, said in the release. “This work together is both a sign of solidarity, and a sign of our collective commitment to the good and wellbeing of all people.”
Southern New Hampshire is partnering with Guild Education, a for-profit company that helps companies offer education assistance programs to employees, and Penn Foster, a for-profit high school, for those trainings. The three organizations have also compiled resources for front-line workers who can't work from home during this time and need guidance on how to remain safe.
The microcredentials will give employees badges or certificates they can show to employers. Topics include personal finance management, maintaining mental health and leading in uncertain times.
March 23, 9:30 a.m. The Educational Testing Service today unveiled a GRE and a TOEFL that can be taken at home. The tests were designed to be taken on a computer with live human proctoring.
The tests, which are open for registration today, will initially only be given in certain countries:
March 20, 5:45 p.m. Colleges and universities have their hands full dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, as they transition to online classes, close campuses and worrying about the health and housing of their students. But many are worried they may soon have to implement a controversial rule by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos that will change how institutions handle allegations of sexual assault and harassment, including a requirement the accused be able to cross-examine their accusers in a live hearing.
"Issuing Title IX regulations in the midst of coronavirus response would be a huge distraction for schools and colleges, which need to be focused right now on transitioning essential services to online delivery," he said. While institutions are usually given 30 to 90 days to comply with a new rule, he said they should be given at least a year.
“Now is not the time to impose substantial new regulatory burdens on institutions, and significant challenges in implementation, when campuses are closing and responding to the emergency conditions they’re facing,” he said.
Colleges Offer Space for Emergency Response
March 20, 4 p.m. Colleges are prepping their facilities to help respond to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The University of Maine system is working with state and local emergency response teams to determine how its facilities and personnel could be deployed to help, according to a news release.
The system is creating an inventory of available resources, including facilities that could be turned into alternative health-care delivery spaces, existing supplies and the system's logistical capacity.
UMaine's Cooperative Extension already has provided eight full-gown protective equipment suits and face masks to the Penobscot Nation Police Department, which was unable to source the suits through suppliers.
While the system is doing its part to reduce the spread of coronavirus, Dannel P. Malloy, the system's chancellor, said that's not enough.
"With lives hanging in the balance, Maine’s universities must do even more," Malloy said in the release. "We are considering all appropriate steps to deploy our resources to assist Maine’s public health and emergency management leaders."
Earlier this week, New York University also asked its students to vacate dorms so they could be prepped to house patients infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
March 20, 2:10 p.m. Several leaders in the California State University system, including the chancellor, are postponing their retirements through the fall as higher education grapples with disruption from the novel coronavirus.
DeVos, in a news release issued moments after President Trump announced the suspension during a White House briefing on the coronavirus outbreak, also said she is authorizing an automatic suspension of payments for any borrower who is more than 31 days delinquent on student loans, as of March 13, or for those who become more than 31 days delinquent, essentially giving borrowers a safety net during the national emergency. The forbearance will be in effect for a period of at least 60 days, retroactive to March 13. Borrowers should contact their loan servicer online or by phone, the department said.
"These are anxious times, particularly for students and families whose educations, careers and lives have been disrupted,” said DeVos. “Right now, everyone should be focused on staying safe and healthy, not worrying about their student loan balance growing. I commend President Trump for his quick action on this issue, and I hope it provides meaningful help and peace of mind to those in need.”
"Where possible, the University expectation is that the work that graduate students are compensated for should continue," Harvard announced on its coronavirus webpage. "If work assignments are not possible to complete using online or distance learning technologies, supervisors are encouraged to find other opportunities for graduate student workers to complete their work commitments, including shifting jobs and job descriptions to alternate assignments in order to fulfill their employment obligations."
Graduate student workers who are unable to work because of the pandemic will still be compensated through the semester. Graduate students, regardless of work status, will still receive their stipends.
Colleges and universities, however, are considered part of 16 of the nation's critical infrastructure services, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. These sectors are "considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof," the Homeland Security Department said.

March 20, 10:15 a.m. Top Senate Democrats Friday morning urged U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to use her existing authority to provide relief to federal student loan borrowers, while Congress considers providing help in a new stimulus package during the coronavirus crisis.
In a letter, the Democrats urged DeVos to: not involuntarily collect loan payments through the garnishment of paychecks, tax refunds and Social Security benefits; ensure student loan servicers' call centers remain open, so borrowers can access the help they need; direct all student loan servicers to notify borrowers of their options for repaying their loans, including income-driven repayment; and ensure that students taking leaves of absence due to the coronavirus do not trigger loan repayment.
“The Department has numerous tools at its disposal to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 and the resulting damage to our economy. The President’s announcement that student loan interest will be waived is simply not enough,” wrote the senators.
March 19, 6:33 p.m. Senate Republicans and Democrats on Thursday unveiled plans to help students saddled by debt during the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis, but a rift quickly developed over how.
The Republican proposal would allow borrowers to defer payments for up to three months, without interest growing. It also would allow U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to grant another three months of deferment if necessary, depending on whether a declaration of emergency remains in effect.
Under that proposal, the Department of Education would make monthly loan repayments for borrowers for the remainder of the national emergency declaration. At a minimum, borrowers would have at least $10,000 of their loans paid off by the federal government, under the plan from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer; Senator Patty Murray, the senior Democrat on the Senate education committee; and Senators Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren.
March 19, 3:00 p.m. Citing the pandemic's profound impact, more than 10 associations that represent a wide swath of U.S. higher education released a list of actions by the federal government they said were necessary to help students and colleges.
"While closing campuses or moving entirely to remote instruction have been necessary steps in slowing the spread of the virus among students and staff, these shifts have caused massive disruption to students, institutional operations and institutional finances," said the document, which was prepared by the American Council on Education with backing from associations for private colleges, public and land-grant institutions, research universities, Christian and Catholic colleges, and state higher education executive officers, among others.
Emergency aid targeted to students and colleges. The groups said aid should be disbursed through the Pell Grant system directly to colleges and students, particularly those who are lower income and struggle with basic needs. Grants to institutions should be based partially on enrollment, with at least 25 percent going toward emergency aid for students. Those grants should be capped at $1,500 per student. For-profit colleges and those with "substantial" portions of their enrollments in online programs should only receive the student aid, the groups said, not the institutional grants.
More regulatory flexibility. Congress should temporarily suspend rules relating to the eligibility, determination and disbursement of federal financial aid, the groups said, to assist colleges in getting aid to students rapidly. One example would be to help students not see their eligibility for Pell Grants reduced for a term in which their institution has closed due to COVID-19. Another would be to lift restrictions on the transfer of funds between campus aid programs like Federal Work-Study and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant. The groups also called on Congress to give the education secretary authority to waive or suspend existing statutory and regulatory deadlines.
Catholic University President Tests Positive for COVID-19
March 19, 12:10 p.m. John Garvey, president of Catholic University, released a statement Thursday saying he has tested positive for COVID-19. Garvey, who has been quarantined since March 13, said he no longer has symptoms. He will continue his self-isolation, per CDC guidelines.
"This news may be concerning to many on campus," Garvey said of Catholic, which is located in Washington, D.C. "We have been taking every precaution to stop the spread of COVID-19 in its tracks, including moving all classes online, shutting down our residence halls for the semester, cancelling all athletics games and practices, and giving broad permissions for employees to work from home."
March 19, 11:30 a.m. Senate Democrats released their plan to offer student loan relief to borrowers amid disruptions caused by the pandemic. The proposal would authorize the U.S. Department of Education to make payments equivalent to the amount due for all federal student loan borrowers throughout the duration of the national emergency and public health emergency periods. Garnishment of wages, tax refunds and Social Security benefits also would halt under the plan, which would codify President Trump's plan to waive interest on all federal student loans.
The department also would be required to ensure that each federal student loan borrower receive a minimum of $10,000 in student loan relief no later than 90 days after the conclusion of the national emergency.
Under the plan, the Education Secretary would send monthly notices to all borrowers to allow them to opt out of the suspension and payment contribution and to notify them that the program is temporary and will end at some point when the national emergency has ceased.
March 19, 10:35 a.m. Senator Lamar Alexander on Wednesday called for the U.S. Congress to pass additional measures to help college students and borrowers with student loan debt, including a call to allow borrowers to defer loan payments. “We are going to have to pay what it costs to contain this disease,” Alexander said in the statement, which referred to a third COVID-19 relief bill Congress is considering.
"That legislation will need to fix problems to make the paid leave mandate work, improve and further expand COVID-19 testing, increase the availability of medical masks and other protective equipment, and increase the number of health care workers," said Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate's health and education committee. "We also need to allow students to defer payment on their student loans and to keep their Pell Grants and give the Education secretary flexibility to waive federal academic testing and accountability rules. Congress should pass this legislation immediately."
March 18, 5:08 p.m. Case Western Reserve University and Mansfield University of Pennsylvania both dropped requirements for applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores, citing the COVID-19 pandemic.
U of Washington Professor Dies From COVID-19
March 18, 4:30 p.m. A University of Washington professor has died due to an infection of COVID-19, which is caused by the novel coronavirus.
About 30 percent of colleges already have weak operating performances, so they'll have an even harder time adapting to the disruption caused by the coronavirus and the new recession.
Many colleges have responded to the coronavirus by moving online and sending students home, which will immediately impact revenue streams, according to Moody's.
It's quite possible higher education could face disruption in enrollment, state funding, endowment income and research grants. However, if the economy returns to normal after the outbreak is contained and enrollment stays steady in the fall, these predictions could be reversed.
If disruption from the coronavirus continues into the fall, it's possible some colleges would declare fiscal exigency, according to Moody's. This rarely used mechanism lets colleges facing severe financial difficulties quickly address fixed costs, like tenure.
March 18, 1:40 p.m. Senate Democrats are proposing that the next coronavirus stimulus plan not only defer repayments of federal student loans but pay down the amounts owed, officials confirmed today.
The proposal comes as lawmakers are working on an even bigger coronavirus package than the $100 billion one passed by the House and expected to be approved by the Senate. Republicans thus far haven’t talked about doing more for borrowers than Trump’s announcement Friday that he will temporarily waive the interest on federal student loans.
Politico’s Michael Stratford tweeted Tuesday morning that Trump is proposing the next round of aid include $40 million to pay for waiving the interest. Trump is also calling for $100 million in grants to schools and colleges for coronavirus response, including disinfecting buildings and providing counseling and distance education.
March 18, 11:30 a.m. Accrediting agencies can now perform virtual site visits and extend the term of accreditation in light of the novel coronavirus, according to new guidance from the U.S. Department of Education.
For institutions that were in the process of renewing their accreditation and had a scheduled site visit during this time, agencies can extend the term of accreditation for a reasonable period of time. Accreditors can also provide a good-cause extension to institutions that are on probation but are unable to hold a site visit due to interruptions caused by the coronavirus.
March 18, 10 a.m. Western Governors University is providing training webinars on how to host and manage virtual accreditation evaluation site visits in light of guidance for the novel coronavirus.
The commission plans to do virtual site visits to follow social distancing recommendations from local, state and federal governments.
Universities Ramp Up COVID-19 Testing Capacity
March 18, 9:37 a.m. The University of Washington Virology Lab and Stanford University are among the nation's leading organizations in COVID-19 testing capacity, according to a tracker created by the American Enterprise Institute. The UW lab is able to test 2,000 patients a day, AEI said, while Stanford can process 1,000. Also among U.S. leaders in developing and processing tests are Yale University, the University of California's medical centers, Washington University in St. Louis, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the NorthShore University HealthSystem in Illinois, which has a teaching affiliation with the University of Chicago.
Scientists at UW, for example, began developing their test shortly after reading in December about the spread of the coronavirus in China, the Seattle Times reported.
After a COVID-19 test from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention failed in the nation's initial response to outbreak, the Association of American Medical Colleges reported that academic medical centers quickly sought to fill the void. The association said university labs in the first couple weeks were frustrated by a federal approval process that stalled deployment of tests. But the development and use of tests now appears to be scaling up.
The Stanford Clinical Virology Laboratory said earlier this week that it was using in-house diagnostic tests on hundreds of patient samples each day from around the Bay Area and beyond, with plans to process more than 1,000 tests per day. The university is able to return test results within 24 hours. And it has created a drive-through testing facility in Palo Alto.
Stanford labs have donated equipment and reassigned staff to help conduct the testing. And the university is producing some test components that are in short supply, including primers and probes used to amplify viral genetic material in patient samples. The virology lab also will provide support for a new clinical trial to test the efficacy of the antiviral drug remdesivir in treating people with the virus.
“Very few other places in the country are capable of providing this scale of COVID-19 testing at this point,” Dr. Benjamin Pinsky, the lab's medical director and associate professor of pathology and of infectious diseases at Stanford's School of Medicine, said in a statement. “Fortunately, we had the foresight in January to imagine that the ability to provide testing for COVID-19 would be important, and we worked hard to make that happen.”
March 17, 4:23 p.m. The American Library Association’s Executive Board is recommending academic, public and school libraries consider closing to the public in light of the new coronavirus outbreak.
“To protect library workers and their communities from exposure to COVID-19 in these unprecedented times, we strongly recommend that academic, public, and school library leaders and their trustees and governing bodies evaluate closing libraries to the public and only reopening when guidance from public health officials indicates the risk from COVID-19 has significantly subsided,” it said in a statement.
Closing libraries is typically a local decision. But the board urged administrators, local boards and governments to close libraries. It also threw its support behind paid leave and health-care coverage for staff while libraries are closed.
The question of whether to close libraries is difficult for many, because librarians “pride themselves on being there during critical times for our communities,” the statement said. But it also noted that libraries “are by design unable to practice social distancing to the degree recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health authorities.”
March 17, 4:15 p.m. The Schools, Health and Libraries Broadband Coalition is calling on the Federal Communications Commission to expedite affordable broadband services for unconnected Americans in light of the novel coronavirus.
In response to the public health crisis, colleges and schools are closing and moving coursework online, which can pose a problem for the about seven million students who don't have access to broadband internet at home, according to the letter from the coalition.
authorize emergency funding from the Universal Service Fund for hot-spot lending programs
“The FCC can take several steps now to promote hotspot lending programs and allow schools, libraries and telehealth providers to increase their broadband capacity and share that capacity with the surrounding community,” said John Windhausen Jr., executive director of the coalition, in a statement. “We cannot leave people on the wrong side of an education gap and a healthcare gap, especially with the Centers for Disease Control recommending school closures for at least 8 weeks. The SHLB Coalition urges the FCC to harness the power of community anchor institutions to protect our nation’s access to healthcare and education during this difficult time.”
March 17, 2:10 p.m. New York is suspending student loan debt payments due to the coronavirus.
The state won't be collecting medical or student loan debt, as well as other forms of debt, during that time. About 165,000 cases fit the criteria for the freeze, including patients who owe medical debt to state hospitals, those who owe student debt to State University of New York campuses and individuals or business owners who owe debt related to things like property damage.
The policy also suspends the accrual of interest and fee collection on outstanding state medical and student debt.
“As the financial impact of this emerging crisis grows, we are doing everything we can to support the thousands of New Yorkers who are suffering as a result of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” Cuomo said a statement. “This new action to temporarily suspend the collection of debt owed to the state will help mitigate the financial impact of the outbreak on individuals, families, communities and businesses in New York as we continue to do everything we can to slow the spread of the virus.”
Glenn DuBois, chancellor of the system of 23 community college, which enrolls nearly 230,000 students, announced the decision on Tuesday, citing recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that asks people to avoid public gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks.
March 17, 2 p.m. University of the People, an online nonprofit, is offering its accredited courses to any university to use as students move to online-only education as the novel coronavirus spreads.
All 115 of the university's courses will be open to all colleges, according to a news release. University of the People's faculty members will teach the courses, which students can take for credit at their own universities. The courses will cover topics in general education, business administration, computer science, health science and education.
March 17, 12:33 p.m. As the Senate considers the $104 billion coronavirus stimulus package approved by the House, lawmakers are working on another stimulus package. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Senate Democrats will propose letting student loan borrowers defer payments for six months.
Kyle Southern, director of higher education policy and advocacy for the millennial-focused advocacy group Young Invincibles, also called for a six-month deferment. In a statement he said, "Today’s young people are the most indebted in history, are more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck, and are more likely to be working in hourly or low-wage jobs that are being impacted by widespread closures. Every dollar counts for young people struggling to keep themselves healthy, safe and financially secure … By suspending required payments, the President can put hundreds of dollars per month in the pockets of young people, helping relieve an immense financial burden as they navigate this crisis."
Falwell, Liberty Bow to State Emergency Ban
The reversal comes after officials in Virginia, where Liberty is located, implemented an emergency ban on public gatherings of 100 people or more, according to a news release.
March 17, 9:40 a.m. On Monday the U.S. Senate passed a bill that would give the Department of Veterans Affairs discretion to not reduce GI Bill benefits for student veterans who attend colleges or universities that shut down or go online only during the coronavirus pandemic. The Senate rushed through the emergency legislation late last night, Military Times reported. But its fate in the House remains unclear.
March 17, 9:15 a.m. The U.S. Department of Education issued guidelines for ensuring internet accessibility for students with disabilities and in preventing discrimination as colleges and K-12 school cope with the coronavirus pandemic.
March 16, 6:15 p.m. The National Federation of the Blind is urging schools and colleges not to forget their legal obligation to make learning content accessible to all students as they rush to move courses online in response to the spread of COVID-19.
Leader of Calif.'s Two-Year Colleges: Response to Virus to Last Through June
March 16, 5:00 p.m. Eloy Oakley, chancellor of California's community college system, said Monday that the system's response to the coronavirus outbreak likely will last through June, reported Mikhail Zinshteyn, a California-based education reporter.
Oakley was speaking at a hearing. He said the state's two-year colleges should "plan for a second peak of the virus sometime around August or September."
The governing board for the system gave Oakley emergency powers for 180 days. He now has the ability to override existing local and state rules governing community colleges.
March 16, 4:44 p.m. A summit of university presidents from around the globe that had been scheduled for early June has been postponed as COVID-19 spreads.
Dozens of presidents were expected to attend the U7+ Summit at Northwestern University. The gathering was intended to help university leaders “play a leading role in addressing critical global challenges” like climate, inequity, polarization, technological transformation and community engagement.
“We are deeply committed to working across institutional and geographic boundaries to address our greatest global challenges,” Northwestern’s president, Morton Schapiro, said in a statement. “However, the health and safety of our academic and global communities is of paramount importance at this time, necessitating a postponement of the U7+ Summit.”
“We are in unprecedented times and we are taking unprecedented measures as an institution to prevent exposure to the coronavirus that is rapidly spreading in Michigan and around the world,” Adrien Bennings, president of KCC, said in a statement. “We are disappointed that we won’t have the opportunity to celebrate our Bruins’ success by handing them a diploma as they walk across the stage to the applause of their family and friends, but we will find some other way to recognize their accomplishments.”
But after an emergency meeting over the weekend, the board instead opted to suspend all classes and in-person services at the colleges until the end of the month.
March 16, 2:04 p.m. The online nonprofit University of the People reports a huge spike in global applications in response to the coronavirus.
“We are seeing an enormous jump in numbers of applications and interest from areas highly affected by the coronavirus, from students whose schools may have shut down or who may be in quarantine themselves,” Shai Reshef, president of the University of the People, said in an emailed statement.
“We are happy to accommodate these students affected by mounting health concerns,” he said.
Web traffic from Italy, Japan and South Korea -- all countries badly impacted by the pandemic -- has also doubled in recent months.
The SAT of May 2 has been canceled. Makeup exams for the March 14 SAT, scheduled for March 28, have also been canceled "in response to the rapidly evolving situation around the coronavirus (COVID-19)."
ACT has rescheduled the April 4 exam, moving it to June 13 "in response to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19)." In the next few days, everyone who registered for the exam will receive information about the new date.
Generally, students in colleges that are temporarily closed because of the outbreak will still be counted under the same processes as before.
“Per the Census Bureau’s residence criteria, in most cases students living away from home at school should be counted at school, even if they are temporarily elsewhere due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said a Sunday afternoon news release from the Census Bureau.
SEVP stressed that the measures are temporary and that guidance is subject to change. Colleges must notify SEVP of procedural changes they make to respond to the coronavirus within 10 days of making those changes.
Academic Libraries Share Response to COVID-19
March 15, 9:10 a.m. Many institutions are busy preparing to take their in-person courses online, but few academic libraries have significantly altered how they operate in response to the coronavirus, early survey data reveal.
The Academic Library Response to COVID-19 survey was launched on March 11 by Christine Wolff-Eisenberg, manager of surveys and research at Ithaka S+R, and Lisa Janicke Hinchliffe, professor and coordinator for information literacy services and instruction at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Over 200 libraries responded to the survey in the first 24 hours, reporting “relatively little change” in how they serve users. Libraries reported prevention and mitigation measures such as increased cleaning and public event cancellations, but only 64 percent of libraries said they engaged in regular communication with staff to provide updates and guidelines on safety measures.
March 13, 5:35 p.m. Consumer groups applauded President Trump’s announcement that he will indefinitely waive the interest on federal loans during the coronavirus crisis.
But having asked Trump and Congress to put in place a moratorium to give borrowers a break from making any loan payments during the economic fallout from the pandemic, the groups also said the president’s move didn’t go far enough.
"However, many borrowers are going to experience income shocks and urgent expenses that will impede their ability to make their regularly scheduled payments," said Yu. "Moreover, people need the confidence to know that, if they are sick or medically vulnerable or need to care for children, that they can stay home and not face the draconian consequences of defaulting on their student loans."
"We call on President Trump to ensure borrowers, as well as all Americans, have extra cash in their pockets until this global pandemic is over," he said. "The federal government should not require Americans to prioritize payments to the government over ensuring the health and safety of their own families."
And earlier, a Democratic House aide said a moratorium on student loan payments is not expected to be included in the coronavirus package Congress is negotiating with the White House.
March 13, 4:10 p.m. At a news conference to declare a national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump said he is issuing an emergency order to help student loan borrowers. "To help students and families, I have waived interest of student loans until further notice," Trump said.
Wife of UT Austin President Tests Positive 
March 13, 2:30 p.m. Greg Fenves, president of the University of Texas at Austin, is being tested for COVID-19 after his wife, Carmel, tested positive for the virus.
A second member of Fenves's family, who also works at the university, is presumed to have COVID-19 as well, according to a letter from Fenves to the university community.
Fenves, his wife and the other family member are in self-isolation. They are compiling a list of people they have recently had contact with. UT Health Austin nurses will reach out to those on the list who are affiliated with the university for screening.
Last week, Fenves and his wife traveled to New York City for alumni and student events. His wife began experiencing mild flu-like symptoms upon their return.
March 13, 2 p.m. At least one college already has changed its initial response to the novel coronavirus.
“There is no perfect answer to the crisis that has happened upon us,” a statement from the college reads. “We believe this response affirms our twin commitments to quality education and to campus community wellbeing -- even as we acknowledge that a pandemic has a way of throwing a wrench into that mission.”
Call for More Tests
March 13, 11:55 a.m. The Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health is calling on the Trump administration to take action to manufacture quality test kits for the novel coronavirus.
The association, which represents deans and directors of 128 accredited institutions for public health, said in a news release that it felt compelled to speak out about test-kit availability.
“When the United States failed to participate in the World Health Organization’s collaborative effort to bring testing to the world’s nations, it made an implicit commitment to provide its own tests,” the statement reads. “It has failed to do so, and clinical and public health organizations alike do not have anywhere near the testing capacity for an aggressive response to the expanding COVID-19 crisis.”
The association is asking the administration to use emergency public health measures and funding to facilitate public-private partnerships to validate and manufacture test kits for hospitals and clinics. Without enough reliable tests to diagnose and track the virus, the country won’t be able to combat the threat, according to the association.
March 13, 11:55 a.m. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program announced that nonimmigrant students can temporarily use distance learning, either from within the U.S. or elsewhere, to continue their courses in light of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
No Student Loan Relief Expected in Coronavirus Package From Congress
March, 13 11:40 a.m. The multibillion-dollar coronavirus package being negotiated by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin isn’t expected to include a temporary suspension of student loan payments, said a Democratic House aide. Advocacy groups like Veterans Education Success and The Institute for College Access and Successhad been hoping for some temporary relief. House Democrats, however, are working on proposals to provide help.
Meanwhile, Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate's health and education committee, proposed a temporary exemption for students from repaying Pell Grants or student loans if their terms are disrupted. Under current law, Pell Grant recipients would have to return a portion of their grants to the federal government if they withdraw from school, or in this case, if their institution closes.
The bill, co-sponsored by Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, both New York Democrats, would provide $1.2 billion in funding to provide emergency financial aid to college students for basic needs created by unexpected college closures and COVID-19 related disruptions, including food, housing, health care and childcare needs.
The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators applauded the co-sponsors “for acting quickly to find a solution to support financial aid recipients, who may now find themselves in dire situations in the face of this pandemic.”
March 13, 10:50 a.m. Anonymous fliers appeared Wednesday on the campus of Bates College. They falsely claimed Bates was attempting to cope with the viral outbreak through "forced massed contamination," because the college had determined that students and all others will get COVID-19, the Lewiston Sun Journal reported.
“We are all doing our best to grapple with a very challenging public health situation, this kind of action reflects seriously poor judgment and blatant disregard for the concerns and well-being of others,” a Bates spokesman said in a message to the Bates community.
Wharton Creates Coronavirus Course
March 13, 10:30 a.m. As colleges across the country shut down or move online in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania already is taking lessons from the outbreak and putting them into a course.
Epidemics, Natural Disasters and Geopolitics: Managing Global Business and Financial Uncertainty will be a six-week, half-credit course offered remotely starting March 25, after the college’s extended spring break, according to a news release.
The course will discuss financial market reactions to the coronavirus, emotional contagion and how the virus affects the trade war with China.
“There are significant business lessons to be learned from the global response to the coronavirus outbreak, and Wharton is at the forefront of sharing valuable insights and creating a community to exchange ideas,” said Geoff Garrett, dean of the Wharton School. “This is a teachable moment for the global academic community, and this course is just one example of how Wharton is coming together to provide support during a time of heightened anxiety and ambiguity.”
March 13, 10:30 a.m. More colleges are telling students to pack up and head home for the semester due to the novel coronavirus, often leaving students with costs for moving or storing their belongings.
U-Haul has stepped forward to offer 30 days of free self-storage to college students in the U.S. and Canada in response to the outbreak, according to a news release from the company. It also includes use of the company’s portable moving and storage containers.
March 13, 10:10 a.m. Sodexo, a company that operates food and dining services on many college campuses, announced Thursday that all employees, full- and part-time, will be granted sick pay for up to 21 days if they have a confirmed case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, or are asked not to come in because of related symptoms.
This use of sick pay only will be available after an employee has used up their accrued sick time. The limited and haphazard coronavirus testing regimen in the U.S. raises questions about how many employees with the virus will be able to access tests and confirm their cases. The country is far behind others in its ability to test for the virus, a fact acknowledged Thursday by Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
“Sodexo is committed to the health and safety of our employees, our clients and the communities we serve, and that includes supporting our employees where we can if they get sick as they service our clients,” Sarosh Mistry, president of Sodexo USA, said in a statement. “Our long-standing commitment to our employees is something we will stand by, especially at a time like this.”
March 13, 9:20 a.m. Citing two positive cases of COVID-19 in the Austin area, the University of Texas at Austin on Friday morning canceled classes and closed operations. Only essential personnel should work today, the university said.
“This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities,” the NCAA said.
March 12, 4 p.m. The U.S. Department of Education has issued guidelines for institutions regarding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, and the novel coronavirus COVID-19.
Generally, FERPA doesn’t allow colleges to provide information about a student to others without their consent. But there are some exceptions that could allow colleges to send information to others without consent as they deal with the spread of coronavirus, according to Amelia Vance, director of youth and education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum. Vance said much of that guidance was already outlined in what the department released during the spread of the H1N1 virus.
The first exception allows colleges to disclose students’ personal information without their consent if that information is necessary to protect the health and safety of others. For example, if a student tests positive for coronavirus or has symptoms, the college can release a statement saying a student tested positive, without identifying the student.
Colleges could also send emails to students who shared specific classes with the sick student and identify them by name. While the guidance released today says those situations are typically rare, Vance said that likely will not be the case with coronavirus.
For those who are worried about violating regulations, Vance pointed to a 2009 FERPA regulation that said the department won’t second-guess a college’s determination in an emergency unless most people would consider it unreasonable.
The second exception allows colleges to identify students to public health departments. If the college declares it’s an emergency, it can provide that information without students’ consent. If a college said it’s not an emergency, the department could hypothetically issue a subpoena to get the information, Vance said.
Ratings Agency Details Coronavirus Risks
March 12, 2:30 p.m. Operating and enrollment pressure could build on some colleges and universities as COVID-19 spreads, according to a note out this afternoon from Fitch Ratings.
“We are taking this action to protect the safety of our student-athletes, coaches, staff and others who are essential to these activities,” Price said in a statement. “I know it is a great disappointment to our student-athletes and coaches, whose hard work and dedication to their sports and Duke is inspirational to so many, but we must first look out for their health and well-being. This is clearly an unprecedented moment for our university, our region and the wider world. As we take steps to confront the spread of this virus, I’m grateful for the cooperation and support of the entire Duke community.”
March 12, 12:25 p.m. The Big Ten, the Southeastern Conference and the American Athletic Conference will not proceed with men’s basketball conference tournaments, fearing the spread of COVID-19.
March 12, 12:10 p.m. The annual conference for the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, NASPA, has been canceled due to growing concern over the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.
The conference was scheduled to run March 28 through April 1 in Austin, Tex. After the city declared a public health emergency and the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, the organization sent out an email canceling the event.
“The colleges are working very hard to protect the health and safety of students and staff while continuing with the educational mission,” Feist said. “We are accustomed in California to dealing with disasters, and community colleges will be a critical resource as we work through this.”
"By transitioning to distance learning, CUNY will be upholding its responsibility as the largest urban public university in the country and meeting our goal of minimizing exposure to those on our campus communities to coronavirus transmission," Félix V. Matos Rodríguez, CUNY's chancellor, said in a statement.
March 11, 11:22 p.m. The new Student Relief Fund is offering to match donations of up to $5,000 for grants aimed at the hundreds of thousands of college students who are affected by campus closures over COVID-19 concerns, who may face hunger and homelessness as a result. Believe in Students, Edquity and the Rise Fund are matching the donations. The grants will be distributed as emergency aid by Edquity and the FAST Fund, which has locations in 18 cities around the U.S.
New Guidance for Colleges in New Jersey, Medical Colleges
March 11, 6:28 p.m. The New Jersey Office of the Secretary of Higher Education issued new guidance for colleges and universities to make coronavirus-related decisions that affect campus life. The guidance addressed material hardships students might face, travel directives, continuity of instruction, quarantine facilities and procedures, cleaning protocols, and efforts to reduce anxiety
The Association of American Medical Colleges released new recommendations after a meeting at the White House. They covered:
Increasing the availability and use of telehealth.
Supporting hospitals’ efforts to expand capacity to meet surging needs.
"America’s academic medical centers are committed to mounting a vigorous response to contain and mitigate COVID-19 and to providing quality care to any patient affected by this public health emergency, including the under- and uninsured," Dr. David J. Skorton, the association's president and CEO, said in a statement. "Because of their expert faculty physicians, highly trained health care teams and cutting-edge medical technology, major teaching hospitals consistently maintain a heightened level of preparedness to respond rapidly to any major event at any time."
March 11, 5:45 p.m. The Delaware Division of Public Health has announced the state’s presumptive first positive cause of COVID-19, which involves “a New Castle County man over the age of 50 who is associated with the University of Delaware community.”
The man affected was exposed to another confirmed case in a different state, according to officials. He is not severely ill. He isolated himself at home when symptoms appeared.
Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, the University of Pennsylvania is extending its spring break for all students aside from those in health-related schools or programs who have already had break or who are in clinical rotations. Penn plans to migrate classroom teaching to virtual instruction for both undergraduate and graduate classes, to begin March 23 and continue through the rest of the semester.
Kentucky students will be able to return to campus residence halls. Research and health-care activities are set to continue as planned. But all international travel sponsored or endorsed by the university has been indefinitely suspended. Any travelers arriving from Europe and Japan will be required to “self-isolate” for 14 days before being allowed on campus.
This means only essential staff and some family members will be permitted to be in the audience of the upcoming weeks of March Madness tournament games, which begin March 17. The precautions will help to protect the fans from transmitting COVID-19, as “behavioral risk mitigation strategies are the best option for slowing the spread of the disease,” the NCAA’s coronavirus advisory panel said in a statement.
“While I understand how disappointing this is for all fans of our sports, my decision is based on the current understanding of how COVID-19 is progressing in the United States,” Emmert said. “This decision is in the best interest of public health, including that of coaches, administrators, fans and, most importantly, our student-athletes. We recognize the opportunity to compete in an NCAA national championship is an experience of a lifetime for the students and their families.”
March 11, 4:45 p.m. Striking graduate students at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have put out a statement regarding the university's move to suspend face-to-face classes and begin instruction online in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The university, the students said, has weaponized the public health crisis to break the wildcat strike.
"We see the university’s turn to emergency measures as a rehearsal for a permanent shift to large scale online instruction, accelerating the creep of online teaching with little oversight, with no bargaining, and with little to no transparency," the statement said. "As UCSC looks for ways to operate in the spring after losing around 80 graduate student employees, the turn to online learning would set an alarming precedent for how a university can function without its workers."
The university responded, "As local, national and global public health recommendations increasingly shift to efforts to mitigate transmission by social distancing, UC Santa Cruz is proactively taking steps to protect our campus community. In our assessment of the current situation, we believe that this is the best action for our campus and the broader Santa Cruz community."
"This will help us reduce density and reduce the spread of this virus," the governor said in a statement on Twitter.
A statement from the governor's office later clarified that the two public university systems will "implement plans to maximize distance learning and reduce in-person classes, beginning March 19, for the remainder of the spring semester in light of the evolving novel coronavirus situation in New York. All campuses will develop plans catered to the campus and curriculum-specific needs while reducing density in the campus environment to help slow possibility for exposures to novel coronavirus. Distance learning and other options will be developed by campuses."
“The health and safety of conference participants and AAC&U staff members are our highest priorities and were the determining factors in this difficult decision,” AAC&U said in a statement.
"The Big Ten Conference’s main priority is to ensure the safety of our students, coaches, administrators, event staff, fans and media as we continue to monitor all relevant information on the COVID-19 virus," the Big Ten said in a statement.
The Ivy League on Tuesday canceled its men's and women's basketball tournaments over coronavirus concerns. Some conference basketball players criticized the move, creating an online petition calling for the tournaments to be reinstated.
March 11, 12:30 p.m. Michigan State University was one of the latest and largest universities to announce the suspension of all in-person classes, effective at noon Wednesday. The university said in a statement that health authorities were investigating and monitoring someone linked to the campus for coronavirus-related concerns.
"We must be better, as college officials, at outlining processes so students can just be students," he said. "Right now, colleges are addressing this pandemic almost solely as a public health issue, when it's actually one affecting inequalities on campuses."
March 11, 11:30 a.m. A large crowd including students from the University of Dayton gathered on the Ohio campus yesterday after the university on Tuesday suspended in-person classes due to coronavirus concerns. The university called on all residential students to leave campus by 6 p.m. Wednesday.
Students were not reacting to the coronavirus measures, the university said, but instead “wanted one last large gathering” before Dayton’s spring break, which begins Friday.
UD students gathered in large crowds on Lowes Street in the South Student Neighborhood Tuesday night in reaction to the news that university housing would close Wednesday for most students due to the spread of the coronavirus.

LIVE UPDATES: How higher education is reacting to the new coronavirus pandemic.
March 28, 4:45 p.m. The mayor of New Haven, Conn., Justin Elicker, yesterday criticized Yale University for declining to make a residence hall available to city police officers and firefighters who may have been exposed to the coronavirus, either directly or through contact with family members. Yale said its student housing facilities were not ready for new occupants and still contained students' possessions.
Peter Salovey, Yale's president, said this afternoon that the university would make 300 beds and expedited testing for COVID-19 available to the city's first responders. Salovey's statement follows.
"Yesterday, New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker expressed frustration with Yale University’s lack of a swift positive response to his request for the university to provide housing for first responders to COVID-19.
Toward that end, we will make 300 beds available by the end of this coming week to first responders and hospital personnel.
Furthermore, we have been working with first responders to make expedited COVID-19 testing in Yale laboratories available to responders who have been exposed to patients.
Additionally, on Thursday we announced a $5 million Yale Community for New Haven Fund to help address the consequences of the epidemic in New Haven.
Now more than ever, Yale and City Hall need to be on the same page. I know how committed all of us across the city and the university are to implementing an effective response to COVID-19, and I will do all I can to support this shared work."
N.Y. Eases Requirements for Health-Care Workers
March 28, 1:24 p.m. New York State has temporarily suspended a wide range of licensing and other requirements for health-care workers in an attempt to mobilize more help in dealing with the pandemic.
Under the executive order from Andrew Cuomo, the state's Democratic governor, students in academic programs for health-care fields are now able to volunteer in medical facilities and receive educational credit. The order also drops certain record-keeping requirements for health-care workers.
In addition, New York's health commissioner for one year can modify examination or recertification requirements for emergency medical services providers.
The state also said a regulation to "allow graduates of foreign medical schools having at least one year of graduate medical education to provide patient care in hospitals" now "is modified so as to allow such graduates without licenses to provide patient care in hospitals if they have completed at least one year of graduate medical education."
March 28, 11:07 a.m. Justin Elicker, the mayor of New Haven, Conn., said Yale University declined a request from the city for the use of a residence hall by asymptomatic city police officers and firefighters, the New Haven Register reported.
The city wanted the Yale residence hall for police officers and firefighters who had been exposed to the coronavirus or have family members who were exposed. Elicker said Friday in a virtual news conference that Peter Salovey, Yale's president, said no to the request. Elicker then called Steve Kaplan, president of the University of New Haven, who, he said, granted the request within five minutes.
Our student rooms still contain their belongings, but we have teams planning the feasibility of packing and storing all the student belongings so that the rooms could be utilized. We are pursuing schemes that involve professional movers and packers, and using temporary storage. The process will take weeks, as all of the residence hall rooms on campus are filled with student belongings. As soon as we have been able to clear any space, we have informed the mayor that we will let him know. We all wish the situation on our campus were different, but because our students had already gone home for spring recess when we implemented our social distancing restrictions, the rooms aren’t ready for others to live in them.
The curfew will start on Sunday at 10 p.m. and last through April 11, at which point the city will re-evaluate the curfew. Walt Maddox, the mayor, said briefings with doctors and researchers showed an "imminent threat" to the city's health-care system, according to AL.com.
The university already had extended its spring break and asked students not to return to campus as the coronavirus spread.
March 27, 3:00 p.m. The Association of Research Libraries on Friday urged publishers to “maximize access to digital content during the emergency conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Earlier this week, the association signed a statement by the International Coalition of Library Consortia asking publishers to ease any simultaneous usage and interlibrary loan restrictions on subscription-based content. In a separate statement, the ARL said that opening up academic resources ensures students can continue their studies, and “scholars can continue their research and work to end the pandemic. As research library leaders, our member representatives understand that innovation, particularly in emergencies at a global scale, often happens at disciplinary intersections.”
As to research on COVID-19, the association pushed publishers to adopt an “expansive view” of research materials -- think articles, book chapters, multimedia and data -- “as they temporarily remove paywalls and create open resource portals related to the virus.” Topic-wise, the ARL advised opening up research on respiration, crisis and disaster management and response, clinical psychology, and other areas. More generally, 50 university presses already opened content on Johns Hopkins University Press’s Project MUSE for the rest of the academic year.
The lawsuit alleges that the University of Arizona, Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University have refused to refund the cost of room, board and other campus fees for the spring semester after the coronavirus outbreak forced campuses to close.
The Board of Regents recently announced that classes would be moved online due to the global health pandemic and encouraged students to move out of their campus residences.
March 26, 2:15 p.m. The House on Friday approved a massive $2 trillion coronavirus relief package, and President Trump signed it into law a few hours later. The measures will pay as much as $1,200 apiece to adults, increase unemployment benefits and provide loans to businesses.
The bill, passed by the Senate Wednesday night, also provides $14 billion in funding for higher education institutions, half of which must be used for emergency grants to help students affected by the crisis.
But, Barba said, “today’s coronavirus bill is a life raft -- but not a rescue boat -- for the millions of young people who are still grappling with how they will make ends meet as they navigate challenges like unemployment, student loan debt and paying their daily expenses.”
“Congress must do more in the weeks ahead to bolster the resources and protections provided to students, researchers, universities, laboratories, hospitals, and medical professionals,” Association of American Universities president Mary Sue Coleman said in a statement after the vote.
The NCAA announced yesterday that Division III’s revenue allocation from the association for fiscal year 2019-20 will be $22.3 million less than it was last year, as a result of losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. A Division III committee on strategic planning and finance decided on Tuesday to cancel several student and staff development programs and conferences to cut down on costs for the remainder of the year, an NCAA press release said.
Tisch students have been advocating for a partial refund of tuition, arguing the forced switch to remote learning due to the coronavirus pandemic won't provide the same level of education for drama and the arts that in-person instruction would have.
“But if the goal is to relieve hardship among families struggling with student debt, one option is to enact a one-time automatic rehabilitation of all defaulted loans, which would give a fresh start to defaulted borrowers at the end of the health emergency," said Chingos. "Congress could eliminate the fees and capitalized interest added to defaulted loans, effectively giving defaulted borrowers a second chance to pay what they would owe if they hadn’t defaulted."
March 26, 6:00 p.m. A coalition of attorneys general is calling on the U.S. Department of Education to provide emergency relief for federal student loan borrowers.
“Thousands of New Yorkers and millions more across the country were already struggling with student loan debt prior to the coronavirus, but today, the financial hardship many face is more severe as a result of business closures, lost wages, and job losses,” James said in a statement. “Borrowers need immediate relief and cannot wait for a stimulus package to pass through Congress which is why our coalition is calling on the Department of Education to take immediate action and protect student loan borrowers. Any stimulus relief should be weighed separately and should not be used as an excuse to deprive borrowers what they need. Secretary [Betsy] DeVos has the power to help millions or ensure they are [not] left with billions in insurmountable debt.”
Yesterday, DeVos announced the department will stop collection actions and garnishing the wages of borrowers who are behind on their student loan payments. That order is effective for at least 60 days during the coronavirus outbreak.
Nearly $800 million -- most of the NCAA’s revenue -- comes from the Division I men’s basketball March Madness tournament, which was canceled two weeks ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. The $225 million to be given to Division I institutions in June will be made up of $50 million from NCAA reserves, and the remaining funds will come from credit lines to be paid off by a $270 million event cancellation insurance policy. The NCAA will also undergo a “variety of cost-cutting budget measures,” the press release said.
The NCAA has prepared for such revenue losses, said Michael Drake, chair of its Board of Governors and president of Ohio State University. The pandemic is a “financial catastrophic event,” he said.
March 26, 3 p.m. Ohio University is pausing personnel-related budget cuts because of the coronavirus.
Enrollment has been down at the university, but Nellis said in a letter to faculty, staff and leadership that the situation is being reassessed in light of the public health pandemic.
West Florida provided the estimated cost of all refunds after yesterday announcing details about prorated rooming refunds in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. It is providing refunds based on flat rates that vary by the type of housing unit in which students lived.
The university cites guidance from Larry Hogan, governor of Maryland, and public health experts for the decision in a news release.
Originally, students who wished to return to campus to get their belongings and officially move out were told to come to campus between March 27 and April 5. But it's not clear if doing so would go against public health recommendations to maximize social distancing, the release states.
Residents who are still living on campus are asked to continue with their move-out plans following public health and travel guidelines if it is safe for them to do so. Students who were approved for emergency on-campus housing starting April 5 can remain in residence halls.
Repercussions of the depression-level spike will be felt broadly across higher education, experts said. Colleges and universities themselves have begun to struggle as broad swaths of the economy have been shut down amid social-distancing efforts to blunt the pandemic. Many are freezing new hires, cutting pay or laying off staff members, particularly contract workers. More such actions, including furloughs, are likely in coming weeks.
The funding will help historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges and universities, and other minority-serving institutions cover the operational costs of responding to the coronavirus pandemic. The costs include transitioning from in-person, on-campus instruction to distance and online options, assisting some students with the costs of moving off-campus and returning home, keeping residential halls open for those who cannot go home, and ensuring that campus buildings are safe and free of the virus. All those costs "put a tremendous unforeseen financial strain on institutions that have historically been underfunded," according to the United Negro College Fund.
“I want to thank the congressional leadership for responding to our call and the needs of HBCUs, and indeed the rest of the higher education community,” UNCF president and CEO Michael L. Lomax said in a prepared statement. “I call on the House and Senate to swiftly pass this legislation. Also, let me be clear: the COVID-19 pandemic is hitting HBCUs hard. All emergencies that hit the higher education system seem to hit HBCUs harder because we serve mostly Pell Grant-eligible students.”
March 25, 4:40 p.m. The University of Maine system is estimating that refunding room and board to students who are no longer living on campus because of the coronavirus outbreak will cost $12.85 million.
That’s about 2.3 percent of the university’s total revenue budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, which is $553 million. Pressure to issue room and board refunds is one important source of financial stress for colleges and universities scrambling to protect students from the pandemic by sending them home and transitioning classes to remote or online instruction. But it has remained unclear exactly how much refunds will cost most institutions, as many have been crunching the numbers.
“Today’s resumption of classes will be unlike anything before in the history of our universities,” Dannel Malloy, chancellor of the University of Maine system, said in a news release. “The transition to distance instruction and 95% reduction in our on-campus population were necessary to protect community health and help blunt the spread of the virus.”
March 25, 4:20 p.m. Citing impacts and uncertainties tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, S&P Global Ratings today moved its outlook to negative for private student housing projects connected to U.S. colleges and universities.
“Given this and the lack of clarity around the possible duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, in our opinion, fall 2020 enrollment at U.S. colleges and universities will likely be weaker than expected, and occupancy in privatized student housing projects could be negatively affected,” the ratings agency said in a news release.
The financial crisis isn’t being caused by whether companies are doing well, either, Berk said. Rather, the market is reflecting the impact of the health pandemic. The way to fix that is to stop the spread of the coronavirus and find a vaccine for it.
“Every dollar that’s taken away from supporting investors and United Airlines and put into families and into our medical system to make sure that we beat this crisis is going to serve us much better in the long run,” said Paul Pfleiderer, professor of finance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
When asked about whether the United States could see a “double dip” pandemic if the administration calls for an end to social distancing too soon, the professors said they are worried.
“We’re seeing a fragility of the economy” due to corporations loading up on cheap debt, said Anat Admati, professor of finance and economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “The consequences of ignoring health experts are dire for everybody -- for both people and the economy.”
March 25, 2:36 p.m. Betsy DeVos, the U.S. education secretary, announced the department will stop collection actions and garnishing the wages of borrowers who are behind on their student loan payments. The order is in effect for at least 60 days during the coronavirus outbreak.
"These are difficult times for many Americans, and we don't want to do anything that will make it harder for them to make ends meet or create additional stress," DeVos said in a statement. "Americans counting on their tax refund or Social Security check to make ends meet during this national emergency should receive those funds, and our actions today will make sure they do."
March 25, 2:25 p.m. The president of the umbrella association representing colleges and universities said the amount of aid for higher education institutions included in the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill headed to a vote in the Senate is “woefully inadequate.”
While the bill is still being finalized and education lobbyists are reviewing the mammoth document, a summary of the proposal said it includes $30.75 billion in grants to “provide emergency support to local school systems and higher education institutions to continue to provide educational services to their students.” That amount appears to be about $29 billion less than what higher education institutions could potentially get in the bill proposed by House Democrats, but $21 billion more than what Senate Republicans had initially proposed, one higher education lobbyist said.
Early Graduation for NYU Medical Students
March 25, 1:10 p.m. New York University's Grossman School of Medicine is allowing some medical students to graduate early to help in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
Students in the graduating Class of 2020 who meet completion requirements will be able to start working as early as April, according to Brief19, a medical news outlet on the coronavirus started by physicians, which obtained a copy of the dean's letter to students.
The dean told students they would be fully compensated if they elect to graduate early, according to Brief19, and the offer is open for students studying any field of medicine. The intent is to relieve front-line health workers in New York who are working overtime to treat those with COVID-19.
But according to summaries of the bill making the rounds among education advocacy groups and obtained by Inside Higher Ed, the measure will also include changes sought by advocates such as not requiring Pell Grant students to repay money to the federal government if their terms are disrupted by the coronavirus emergency.
A separate summary contains $30.75 billion in grants to “provide emergency support to local school systems and higher education institutions to continue to provide educational services to their students and support.” That amount appears be about $29 billion less than what higher education institutions could potentially get in the bill proposed by House Democrats, but $21 billion more than what Senate Republicans had initially proposed, one higher education lobbyist said. Associations representing institutions that were disappointed with the previous proposals were still waiting for the full bill before they commented on the level of funding.
"After reviewing the job duties of employees who are required to work from home, the university concluded that the work performed by some of its employees is not amenable to working remotely," LIU Post said in a statement to the newspaper. "Accordingly, LIU has reluctantly decided to temporarily lay off a small percentage of its workforce for the next 30 days. The university has committed to making no further adjustments during this period."
A growing number of colleges and universities have announced pay cuts and hiring freezes amid the initial financial hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Quinnipiac University this week cut pay for faculty and staff members. And the University of Bridgeport recently said a budget deficit and the pandemic’s impact will lead to staff cuts.
I extend my most sincere thanks, that of IU’s senior leadership and that of the IU Trustees to all our faculty who are working with such breakneck speed to transform their courses to all virtual instruction. Our most sincere thanks to all our staff who provide the myriad support services that are making this transformation possible. Our most sincere thanks to all the staff who are keeping as much as possible of the normal business of the university operating. And our special thanks to all those at the front lines of this fight — those responsible for cleaning and sanitizing of the university, the police and other public safety officials, and our health care workers who are working with those who have or have been exposed to COVID-19. To all of you we express our most grateful thanks.
The university said the decision is due to the coronavirus pandemic, the New Haven Independent reported.
“The far-reaching disruptions caused by Covid-19 have resulted in significant additional expenses for our university and lost revenues from programs that were canceled. In addition, the pandemic creates uncertainty in our future enrollment projections,” Judy Olian, president of Quinnipiac, wrote in an email to faculty and staff, according to the Independent. “Accordingly, we are taking measured steps now to address our financial reality.”
March 24, 2:35 p.m. A Democratic aide tells Inside Higher Ed the $10,000 debt cancellation Democrats in the House and Senate wanted as part of the coronavirus rescue legislation is not a viable option. A smaller form of cancellation is possible, the aide said.
The public university's Board of Trustees cited issues stemming from the novel coronavirus in their proclamation, which was first reported on Twitter by Dan Bauman, a reporter at The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The board anticipates that the measures the university took to prevent the spread of the virus, such as canceling in-person classes and closing the campus to the public, will lead to a drop in enrollment and retention. The absence of people on campus will lead to a drop in revenue for auxiliary services. Event cancellations will also hurt the university.
The loss of economic activity and tax revenue for the state from the pandemic also is likely to lead to less funding for public institutions, the board's letter said.
Harvard's President Tests Positive
March 24, 1 p.m. The president of Harvard University has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The couple began experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 on Sunday. They've been working from home and practicing social distancing since March 14, according to the letter, and are unsure how they caught the virus.
"This virus can lay anyone low. We all need to be vigilant and keep following guidelines to limit our contact with others," Bacow wrote. "Your swift actions over the past few weeks -- to respond to the needs of our community, to fulfill our teaching mission and to pursue research that will save lives -- have moved me deeply and made me extraordinarily grateful and proud."
COVID-19 Death at New York's International House
March 24, 11:43 a.m. A resident of International House -- a living-learning community in New York City connected with Columbia University -- died Saturday of complications of COVID-19, and International House reported today that another member of its community had tested positive for COVID-19 and “has been recovering without complications outside the premises for over two weeks.” International House also said a staff member tested positive several weeks ago and is also recovering at home without complications.
March 24, 11:20 a.m. Colleges and universities are hoping to see a Republican proposal to encourage more charitable donations during the coronavirus crisis included in the mammoth stimulus package being negotiated in Congress.
While classes are being taught online, Liberty is opening up campus for students who wish to return to their residence halls, according to a news release. Faculty members also are expected to hold office hours, but they can file requests for accommodations if they feel they are at higher risk for contracting and recovering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The Virginia Department of Health sent an inspector for a surprise visit to the campus after the governor announced the 10-person limit, according to the news release. The university was found to be in compliance with all restrictions.
Annex I, a former hotel owned by Liberty, is being used to quarantine those with symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Yet, the rapidly changing circumstances, even as recently as this weekend, made us question whether our vision of a safe-haven virtual environment could be realized,” Levine and Walker wrote. “We have been monitoring the coronavirus disease, now sweeping the United States, over the last week to assess whether our vision of a free, open-access Virtual Annual Meeting for all would continue to provide the safe and secure space for participants and attendees we had imagined, or whether it was adding to a ‘to do’ list growing exponentially for far too many.”
"The impact of COVID-19 on the state, its economy, and budget and finances is unpredictable and rapidly changing, but the state believes that events surrounding COVID-19 will negatively impact the state’s economy and financial condition," Muoio said. "The actual impact of COVID-19 on the state, its economy and its budget and finances will heavily depend on future events, including future events outside of the control of the state, and actions by the federal government as well as nations across the world."
March 23, 5:50 p.m. The American Indian Higher Education Consortium is asking its members to advocate for special funding to help tribal colleges mitigate the coronavirus pandemic.
"With the spread of COVID-19, TCUs and TCU students are faced with tremendous, disruptive change. We need to secure our campuses, move to online learning, and create safe spaces and opportunities to learn at a distance," the release states. "Yet TCUs have the worst internet access, at the highest average cost, when compared to all other colleges and universities in the United States. TCUs educate more enrolled American Indians and Alaska Natives than any other postsecondary education institutions in the U.S. -- and our students need and deserve equitable resources."
Current proposals include emergency aid, but only a limited amount for tribal colleges, according to the release.
Like the Senate Democratic plan, House Democrats proposed for the federal government to cover monthly student loan payments for borrowers, as long as a national emergency declaration over the coronavirus epidemic continues. And the payments would reduce the balances of what borrowers owe.
In addition, another $9.5 billion, including $1.5 billion for historically black colleges and universities, would be distributed through as-yet-undetermined grant process to reimburse institutions for coronavirus-related costs.
Coronavirus Call Centers
March 23, 3:45 p.m. Got questions about coronavirus? Some colleges are starting call centers to provide answers for students, parents and staff members.
Purdue University is launching its call center today to provide information on what COVID-19 means for the university in Indiana, from housing to financial aid to academics. University employees will staff the center Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m.
Colleges, Organizations Offer Emergency Aid to Students
March 23, 3:20 p.m. Colleges and universities are offering emergency funds to students in light of the spread of a novel coronavirus.
The Northern Virginia Community College Educational Foundation launched a new emergency aid fund for students affected by the pandemic with a $250,000 contribution from the NOVA Foundation. More than half of NOVA's students work in full- or part-time jobs, many of which are now at risk as the country enters a recession.
“Ensuring every NOVA student succeeds is our highest priority always,” Anne Kress, NOVA's president, said in a news release. “But especially now, as our students face unprecedented challenges, we have an obligation to ensure they have our support. Our students will help our community rebuild and prosper but they can only do this if we provide the assistance they need. I encourage everyone to consider donating to the Emergency Student Aid Fund.”
Temple University in Philadelphia also is offering emergency aid funds for students who apply, as well as partnering with community groups to offer services like food pantries, according to The Temple News.
Several organizations have partnered to start the Student Relief Fund, which has so far raised $95,000 to help students whose lives were affected by COVID-19.
March 23, 2:20 p.m. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said House Democrats will propose slightly more aid for higher education institutions than Republicans proposed in the Senate. While short on details, Pelosi said in a statement that the House Democratic proposal "pumps nearly $40 billion into schools and universities, with $30 billion directly provided to states to help them stabilize their funding for schools and nearly $10 billion to help alleviate the harm caused by coronavirus on higher education institutions, while providing them with added flexibility to continue operating during the crisis."
It’s unclear how much support the proposal has even among House Democrats. Politico reported on Sunday that Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin she wants a package dealing with the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak to include at least $10,000 in debt cancellation.
Amy Klobuchar's Husband Tests Positive
March 23, 1 p.m. John Bessler, a professor and husband of Amy Klobuchar, the U.S. senator and former Democratic presidential candidate, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19.
He is now at a hospital in Virginia and is on oxygen but is not on a ventilator.
"I love my husband so very much and not being able to be there at the hospital by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease," Klobuchar said in her statement.
March 23, 12:35 p.m. Southern New Hampshire University on Monday unveiled a suite of free resources in light of the novel coronavirus, including modules on how to run a drive-through COVID-19 test site.
The private nonprofit college is offering online trainings and education resources for educators, front-line workers and health-care workers, according to a news release.
One of the microcredentials offered is targeted at health-care workers, like retail pharmacy technicians, volunteer health-care workers and EMTs. The free training will teach those workers how to operate drive-through testing sites for the virus.
“The spread of COVID-19 has shown us the critical importance of collaboration and helping those in need,” Paul LeBlanc, president and CEO of the university, said in the release. “This work together is both a sign of solidarity, and a sign of our collective commitment to the good and wellbeing of all people.”
Southern New Hampshire is partnering with Guild Education, a for-profit company that helps companies offer education assistance programs to employees, and Penn Foster, a for-profit high school, for those trainings. The three organizations have also compiled resources for front-line workers who can't work from home during this time and need guidance on how to remain safe.
The microcredentials will give employees badges or certificates they can show to employers. Topics include personal finance management, maintaining mental health and leading in uncertain times.
March 23, 9:30 a.m. The Educational Testing Service today unveiled a GRE and a TOEFL that can be taken at home. The tests were designed to be taken on a computer with live human proctoring.
The tests, which are open for registration today, will initially only be given in certain countries:
March 20, 5:45 p.m. Colleges and universities have their hands full dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, as they transition to online classes, close campuses and worrying about the health and housing of their students. But many are worried they may soon have to implement a controversial rule by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos that will change how institutions handle allegations of sexual assault and harassment, including a requirement the accused be able to cross-examine their accusers in a live hearing.
"Issuing Title IX regulations in the midst of coronavirus response would be a huge distraction for schools and colleges, which need to be focused right now on transitioning essential services to online delivery," he said. While institutions are usually given 30 to 90 days to comply with a new rule, he said they should be given at least a year.
“Now is not the time to impose substantial new regulatory burdens on institutions, and significant challenges in implementation, when campuses are closing and responding to the emergency conditions they’re facing,” he said.
Colleges Offer Space for Emergency Response
March 20, 4 p.m. Colleges are prepping their facilities to help respond to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The University of Maine system is working with state and local emergency response teams to determine how its facilities and personnel could be deployed to help, according to a news release.
The system is creating an inventory of available resources, including facilities that could be turned into alternative health-care delivery spaces, existing supplies and the system's logistical capacity.
UMaine's Cooperative Extension already has provided eight full-gown protective equipment suits and face masks to the Penobscot Nation Police Department, which was unable to source the suits through suppliers.
While the system is doing its part to reduce the spread of coronavirus, Dannel P. Malloy, the system's chancellor, said that's not enough.
"With lives hanging in the balance, Maine’s universities must do even more," Malloy said in the release. "We are considering all appropriate steps to deploy our resources to assist Maine’s public health and emergency management leaders."
Earlier this week, New York University also asked its students to vacate dorms so they could be prepped to house patients infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
March 20, 2:10 p.m. Several leaders in the California State University system, including the chancellor, are postponing their retirements through the fall as higher education grapples with disruption from the novel coronavirus.
DeVos, in a news release issued moments after President Trump announced the suspension during a White House briefing on the coronavirus outbreak, also said she is authorizing an automatic suspension of payments for any borrower who is more than 31 days delinquent on student loans, as of March 13, or for those who become more than 31 days delinquent, essentially giving borrowers a safety net during the national emergency. The forbearance will be in effect for a period of at least 60 days, retroactive to March 13. Borrowers should contact their loan servicer online or by phone, the department said.
"These are anxious times, particularly for students and families whose educations, careers and lives have been disrupted,” said DeVos. “Right now, everyone should be focused on staying safe and healthy, not worrying about their student loan balance growing. I commend President Trump for his quick action on this issue, and I hope it provides meaningful help and peace of mind to those in need.”
"Where possible, the University expectation is that the work that graduate students are compensated for should continue," Harvard announced on its coronavirus webpage. "If work assignments are not possible to complete using online or distance learning technologies, supervisors are encouraged to find other opportunities for graduate student workers to complete their work commitments, including shifting jobs and job descriptions to alternate assignments in order to fulfill their employment obligations."
Graduate student workers who are unable to work because of the pandemic will still be compensated through the semester. Graduate students, regardless of work status, will still receive their stipends.
Colleges and universities, however, are considered part of 16 of the nation's critical infrastructure services, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. These sectors are "considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof," the Homeland Security Department said.

March 20, 10:15 a.m. Top Senate Democrats Friday morning urged U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to use her existing authority to provide relief to federal student loan borrowers, while Congress considers providing help in a new stimulus package during the coronavirus crisis.
In a letter, the Democrats urged DeVos to: not involuntarily collect loan payments through the garnishment of paychecks, tax refunds and Social Security benefits; ensure student loan servicers' call centers remain open, so borrowers can access the help they need; direct all student loan servicers to notify borrowers of their options for repaying their loans, including income-driven repayment; and ensure that students taking leaves of absence due to the coronavirus do not trigger loan repayment.
“The Department has numerous tools at its disposal to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 and the resulting damage to our economy. The President’s announcement that student loan interest will be waived is simply not enough,” wrote the senators.
March 19, 6:33 p.m. Senate Republicans and Democrats on Thursday unveiled plans to help students saddled by debt during the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis, but a rift quickly developed over how.
The Republican proposal would allow borrowers to defer payments for up to three months, without interest growing. It also would allow U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to grant another three months of deferment if necessary, depending on whether a declaration of emergency remains in effect.
Under that proposal, the Department of Education would make monthly loan repayments for borrowers for the remainder of the national emergency declaration. At a minimum, borrowers would have at least $10,000 of their loans paid off by the federal government, under the plan from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer; Senator Patty Murray, the senior Democrat on the Senate education committee; and Senators Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren.
March 19, 3:00 p.m. Citing the pandemic's profound impact, more than 10 associations that represent a wide swath of U.S. higher education released a list of actions by the federal government they said were necessary to help students and colleges.
"While closing campuses or moving entirely to remote instruction have been necessary steps in slowing the spread of the virus among students and staff, these shifts have caused massive disruption to students, institutional operations and institutional finances," said the document, which was prepared by the American Council on Education with backing from associations for private colleges, public and land-grant institutions, research universities, Christian and Catholic colleges, and state higher education executive officers, among others.
Emergency aid targeted to students and colleges. The groups said aid should be disbursed through the Pell Grant system directly to colleges and students, particularly those who are lower income and struggle with basic needs. Grants to institutions should be based partially on enrollment, with at least 25 percent going toward emergency aid for students. Those grants should be capped at $1,500 per student. For-profit colleges and those with "substantial" portions of their enrollments in online programs should only receive the student aid, the groups said, not the institutional grants.
More regulatory flexibility. Congress should temporarily suspend rules relating to the eligibility, determination and disbursement of federal financial aid, the groups said, to assist colleges in getting aid to students rapidly. One example would be to help students not see their eligibility for Pell Grants reduced for a term in which their institution has closed due to COVID-19. Another would be to lift restrictions on the transfer of funds between campus aid programs like Federal Work-Study and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant. The groups also called on Congress to give the education secretary authority to waive or suspend existing statutory and regulatory deadlines.
Catholic University President Tests Positive for COVID-19
March 19, 12:10 p.m. John Garvey, president of Catholic University, released a statement Thursday saying he has tested positive for COVID-19. Garvey, who has been quarantined since March 13, said he no longer has symptoms. He will continue his self-isolation, per CDC guidelines.
"This news may be concerning to many on campus," Garvey said of Catholic, which is located in Washington, D.C. "We have been taking every precaution to stop the spread of COVID-19 in its tracks, including moving all classes online, shutting down our residence halls for the semester, cancelling all athletics games and practices, and giving broad permissions for employees to work from home."
March 19, 11:30 a.m. Senate Democrats released their plan to offer student loan relief to borrowers amid disruptions caused by the pandemic. The proposal would authorize the U.S. Department of Education to make payments equivalent to the amount due for all federal student loan borrowers throughout the duration of the national emergency and public health emergency periods. Garnishment of wages, tax refunds and Social Security benefits also would halt under the plan, which would codify President Trump's plan to waive interest on all federal student loans.
The department also would be required to ensure that each federal student loan borrower receive a minimum of $10,000 in student loan relief no later than 90 days after the conclusion of the national emergency.
Under the plan, the Education Secretary would send monthly notices to all borrowers to allow them to opt out of the suspension and payment contribution and to notify them that the program is temporary and will end at some point when the national emergency has ceased.
March 19, 10:35 a.m. Senator Lamar Alexander on Wednesday called for the U.S. Congress to pass additional measures to help college students and borrowers with student loan debt, including a call to allow borrowers to defer loan payments. “We are going to have to pay what it costs to contain this disease,” Alexander said in the statement, which referred to a third COVID-19 relief bill Congress is considering.
"That legislation will need to fix problems to make the paid leave mandate work, improve and further expand COVID-19 testing, increase the availability of medical masks and other protective equipment, and increase the number of health care workers," said Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate's health and education committee. "We also need to allow students to defer payment on their student loans and to keep their Pell Grants and give the Education secretary flexibility to waive federal academic testing and accountability rules. Congress should pass this legislation immediately."
March 18, 5:08 p.m. Case Western Reserve University and Mansfield University of Pennsylvania both dropped requirements for applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores, citing the COVID-19 pandemic.
U of Washington Professor Dies From COVID-19
March 18, 4:30 p.m. A University of Washington professor has died due to an infection of COVID-19, which is caused by the novel coronavirus.
About 30 percent of colleges already have weak operating performances, so they'll have an even harder time adapting to the disruption caused by the coronavirus and the new recession.
Many colleges have responded to the coronavirus by moving online and sending students home, which will immediately impact revenue streams, according to Moody's.
It's quite possible higher education could face disruption in enrollment, state funding, endowment income and research grants. However, if the economy returns to normal after the outbreak is contained and enrollment stays steady in the fall, these predictions could be reversed.
If disruption from the coronavirus continues into the fall, it's possible some colleges would declare fiscal exigency, according to Moody's. This rarely used mechanism lets colleges facing severe financial difficulties quickly address fixed costs, like tenure.
March 18, 1:40 p.m. Senate Democrats are proposing that the next coronavirus stimulus plan not only defer repayments of federal student loans but pay down the amounts owed, officials confirmed today.
The proposal comes as lawmakers are working on an even bigger coronavirus package than the $100 billion one passed by the House and expected to be approved by the Senate. Republicans thus far haven’t talked about doing more for borrowers than Trump’s announcement Friday that he will temporarily waive the interest on federal student loans.
Politico’s Michael Stratford tweeted Tuesday morning that Trump is proposing the next round of aid include $40 million to pay for waiving the interest. Trump is also calling for $100 million in grants to schools and colleges for coronavirus response, including disinfecting buildings and providing counseling and distance education.
March 18, 11:30 a.m. Accrediting agencies can now perform virtual site visits and extend the term of accreditation in light of the novel coronavirus, according to new guidance from the U.S. Department of Education.
For institutions that were in the process of renewing their accreditation and had a scheduled site visit during this time, agencies can extend the term of accreditation for a reasonable period of time. Accreditors can also provide a good-cause extension to institutions that are on probation but are unable to hold a site visit due to interruptions caused by the coronavirus.
March 18, 10 a.m. Western Governors University is providing training webinars on how to host and manage virtual accreditation evaluation site visits in light of guidance for the novel coronavirus.
The commission plans to do virtual site visits to follow social distancing recommendations from local, state and federal governments.
Universities Ramp Up COVID-19 Testing Capacity
March 18, 9:37 a.m. The University of Washington Virology Lab and Stanford University are among the nation's leading organizations in COVID-19 testing capacity, according to a tracker created by the American Enterprise Institute. The UW lab is able to test 2,000 patients a day, AEI said, while Stanford can process 1,000. Also among U.S. leaders in developing and processing tests are Yale University, the University of California's medical centers, Washington University in St. Louis, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the NorthShore University HealthSystem in Illinois, which has a teaching affiliation with the University of Chicago.
Scientists at UW, for example, began developing their test shortly after reading in December about the spread of the coronavirus in China, the Seattle Times reported.
After a COVID-19 test from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention failed in the nation's initial response to outbreak, the Association of American Medical Colleges reported that academic medical centers quickly sought to fill the void. The association said university labs in the first couple weeks were frustrated by a federal approval process that stalled deployment of tests. But the development and use of tests now appears to be scaling up.
The Stanford Clinical Virology Laboratory said earlier this week that it was using in-house diagnostic tests on hundreds of patient samples each day from around the Bay Area and beyond, with plans to process more than 1,000 tests per day. The university is able to return test results within 24 hours. And it has created a drive-through testing facility in Palo Alto.
Stanford labs have donated equipment and reassigned staff to help conduct the testing. And the university is producing some test components that are in short supply, including primers and probes used to amplify viral genetic material in patient samples. The virology lab also will provide support for a new clinical trial to test the efficacy of the antiviral drug remdesivir in treating people with the virus.
“Very few other places in the country are capable of providing this scale of COVID-19 testing at this point,” Dr. Benjamin Pinsky, the lab's medical director and associate professor of pathology and of infectious diseases at Stanford's School of Medicine, said in a statement. “Fortunately, we had the foresight in January to imagine that the ability to provide testing for COVID-19 would be important, and we worked hard to make that happen.”
March 17, 4:23 p.m. The American Library Association’s Executive Board is recommending academic, public and school libraries consider closing to the public in light of the new coronavirus outbreak.
“To protect library workers and their communities from exposure to COVID-19 in these unprecedented times, we strongly recommend that academic, public, and school library leaders and their trustees and governing bodies evaluate closing libraries to the public and only reopening when guidance from public health officials indicates the risk from COVID-19 has significantly subsided,” it said in a statement.
Closing libraries is typically a local decision. But the board urged administrators, local boards and governments to close libraries. It also threw its support behind paid leave and health-care coverage for staff while libraries are closed.
The question of whether to close libraries is difficult for many, because librarians “pride themselves on being there during critical times for our communities,” the statement said. But it also noted that libraries “are by design unable to practice social distancing to the degree recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health authorities.”
March 17, 4:15 p.m. The Schools, Health and Libraries Broadband Coalition is calling on the Federal Communications Commission to expedite affordable broadband services for unconnected Americans in light of the novel coronavirus.
In response to the public health crisis, colleges and schools are closing and moving coursework online, which can pose a problem for the about seven million students who don't have access to broadband internet at home, according to the letter from the coalition.
authorize emergency funding from the Universal Service Fund for hot-spot lending programs
“The FCC can take several steps now to promote hotspot lending programs and allow schools, libraries and telehealth providers to increase their broadband capacity and share that capacity with the surrounding community,” said John Windhausen Jr., executive director of the coalition, in a statement. “We cannot leave people on the wrong side of an education gap and a healthcare gap, especially with the Centers for Disease Control recommending school closures for at least 8 weeks. The SHLB Coalition urges the FCC to harness the power of community anchor institutions to protect our nation’s access to healthcare and education during this difficult time.”
March 17, 2:10 p.m. New York is suspending student loan debt payments due to the coronavirus.
The state won't be collecting medical or student loan debt, as well as other forms of debt, during that time. About 165,000 cases fit the criteria for the freeze, including patients who owe medical debt to state hospitals, those who owe student debt to State University of New York campuses and individuals or business owners who owe debt related to things like property damage.
The policy also suspends the accrual of interest and fee collection on outstanding state medical and student debt.
“As the financial impact of this emerging crisis grows, we are doing everything we can to support the thousands of New Yorkers who are suffering as a result of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” Cuomo said a statement. “This new action to temporarily suspend the collection of debt owed to the state will help mitigate the financial impact of the outbreak on individuals, families, communities and businesses in New York as we continue to do everything we can to slow the spread of the virus.”
Glenn DuBois, chancellor of the system of 23 community college, which enrolls nearly 230,000 students, announced the decision on Tuesday, citing recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that asks people to avoid public gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks.
March 17, 2 p.m. University of the People, an online nonprofit, is offering its accredited courses to any university to use as students move to online-only education as the novel coronavirus spreads.
All 115 of the university's courses will be open to all colleges, according to a news release. University of the People's faculty members will teach the courses, which students can take for credit at their own universities. The courses will cover topics in general education, business administration, computer science, health science and education.
March 17, 12:33 p.m. As the Senate considers the $104 billion coronavirus stimulus package approved by the House, lawmakers are working on another stimulus package. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Senate Democrats will propose letting student loan borrowers defer payments for six months.
Kyle Southern, director of higher education policy and advocacy for the millennial-focused advocacy group Young Invincibles, also called for a six-month deferment. In a statement he said, "Today’s young people are the most indebted in history, are more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck, and are more likely to be working in hourly or low-wage jobs that are being impacted by widespread closures. Every dollar counts for young people struggling to keep themselves healthy, safe and financially secure … By suspending required payments, the President can put hundreds of dollars per month in the pockets of young people, helping relieve an immense financial burden as they navigate this crisis."
Falwell, Liberty Bow to State Emergency Ban
The reversal comes after officials in Virginia, where Liberty is located, implemented an emergency ban on public gatherings of 100 people or more, according to a news release.
March 17, 9:40 a.m. On Monday the U.S. Senate passed a bill that would give the Department of Veterans Affairs discretion to not reduce GI Bill benefits for student veterans who attend colleges or universities that shut down or go online only during the coronavirus pandemic. The Senate rushed through the emergency legislation late last night, Military Times reported. But its fate in the House remains unclear.
March 17, 9:15 a.m. The U.S. Department of Education issued guidelines for ensuring internet accessibility for students with disabilities and in preventing discrimination as colleges and K-12 school cope with the coronavirus pandemic.
March 16, 6:15 p.m. The National Federation of the Blind is urging schools and colleges not to forget their legal obligation to make learning content accessible to all students as they rush to move courses online in response to the spread of COVID-19.
Leader of Calif.'s Two-Year Colleges: Response to Virus to Last Through June
March 16, 5:00 p.m. Eloy Oakley, chancellor of California's community college system, said Monday that the system's response to the coronavirus outbreak likely will last through June, reported Mikhail Zinshteyn, a California-based education reporter.
Oakley was speaking at a hearing. He said the state's two-year colleges should "plan for a second peak of the virus sometime around August or September."
The governing board for the system gave Oakley emergency powers for 180 days. He now has the ability to override existing local and state rules governing community colleges.
March 16, 4:44 p.m. A summit of university presidents from around the globe that had been scheduled for early June has been postponed as COVID-19 spreads.
Dozens of presidents were expected to attend the U7+ Summit at Northwestern University. The gathering was intended to help university leaders “play a leading role in addressing critical global challenges” like climate, inequity, polarization, technological transformation and community engagement.
“We are deeply committed to working across institutional and geographic boundaries to address our greatest global challenges,” Northwestern’s president, Morton Schapiro, said in a statement. “However, the health and safety of our academic and global communities is of paramount importance at this time, necessitating a postponement of the U7+ Summit.”
“We are in unprecedented times and we are taking unprecedented measures as an institution to prevent exposure to the coronavirus that is rapidly spreading in Michigan and around the world,” Adrien Bennings, president of KCC, said in a statement. “We are disappointed that we won’t have the opportunity to celebrate our Bruins’ success by handing them a diploma as they walk across the stage to the applause of their family and friends, but we will find some other way to recognize their accomplishments.”
But after an emergency meeting over the weekend, the board instead opted to suspend all classes and in-person services at the colleges until the end of the month.
March 16, 2:04 p.m. The online nonprofit University of the People reports a huge spike in global applications in response to the coronavirus.
“We are seeing an enormous jump in numbers of applications and interest from areas highly affected by the coronavirus, from students whose schools may have shut down or who may be in quarantine themselves,” Shai Reshef, president of the University of the People, said in an emailed statement.
“We are happy to accommodate these students affected by mounting health concerns,” he said.
Web traffic from Italy, Japan and South Korea -- all countries badly impacted by the pandemic -- has also doubled in recent months.
The SAT of May 2 has been canceled. Makeup exams for the March 14 SAT, scheduled for March 28, have also been canceled "in response to the rapidly evolving situation around the coronavirus (COVID-19)."
ACT has rescheduled the April 4 exam, moving it to June 13 "in response to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19)." In the next few days, everyone who registered for the exam will receive information about the new date.
Generally, students in colleges that are temporarily closed because of the outbreak will still be counted under the same processes as before.
“Per the Census Bureau’s residence criteria, in most cases students living away from home at school should be counted at school, even if they are temporarily elsewhere due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said a Sunday afternoon news release from the Census Bureau.
SEVP stressed that the measures are temporary and that guidance is subject to change. Colleges must notify SEVP of procedural changes they make to respond to the coronavirus within 10 days of making those changes.
Academic Libraries Share Response to COVID-19
March 15, 9:10 a.m. Many institutions are busy preparing to take their in-person courses online, but few academic libraries have significantly altered how they operate in response to the coronavirus, early survey data reveal.
The Academic Library Response to COVID-19 survey was launched on March 11 by Christine Wolff-Eisenberg, manager of surveys and research at Ithaka S+R, and Lisa Janicke Hinchliffe, professor and coordinator for information literacy services and instruction at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Over 200 libraries responded to the survey in the first 24 hours, reporting “relatively little change” in how they serve users. Libraries reported prevention and mitigation measures such as increased cleaning and public event cancellations, but only 64 percent of libraries said they engaged in regular communication with staff to provide updates and guidelines on safety measures.
March 13, 5:35 p.m. Consumer groups applauded President Trump’s announcement that he will indefinitely waive the interest on federal loans during the coronavirus crisis.
But having asked Trump and Congress to put in place a moratorium to give borrowers a break from making any loan payments during the economic fallout from the pandemic, the groups also said the president’s move didn’t go far enough.
"However, many borrowers are going to experience income shocks and urgent expenses that will impede their ability to make their regularly scheduled payments," said Yu. "Moreover, people need the confidence to know that, if they are sick or medically vulnerable or need to care for children, that they can stay home and not face the draconian consequences of defaulting on their student loans."
"We call on President Trump to ensure borrowers, as well as all Americans, have extra cash in their pockets until this global pandemic is over," he said. "The federal government should not require Americans to prioritize payments to the government over ensuring the health and safety of their own families."
And earlier, a Democratic House aide said a moratorium on student loan payments is not expected to be included in the coronavirus package Congress is negotiating with the White House.
March 13, 4:10 p.m. At a news conference to declare a national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump said he is issuing an emergency order to help student loan borrowers. "To help students and families, I have waived interest of student loans until further notice," Trump said.
Wife of UT Austin President Tests Positive 
March 13, 2:30 p.m. Greg Fenves, president of the University of Texas at Austin, is being tested for COVID-19 after his wife, Carmel, tested positive for the virus.
A second member of Fenves's family, who also works at the university, is presumed to have COVID-19 as well, according to a letter from Fenves to the university community.
Fenves, his wife and the other family member are in self-isolation. They are compiling a list of people they have recently had contact with. UT Health Austin nurses will reach out to those on the list who are affiliated with the university for screening.
Last week, Fenves and his wife traveled to New York City for alumni and student events. His wife began experiencing mild flu-like symptoms upon their return.
March 13, 2 p.m. At least one college already has changed its initial response to the novel coronavirus.
“There is no perfect answer to the crisis that has happened upon us,” a statement from the college reads. “We believe this response affirms our twin commitments to quality education and to campus community wellbeing -- even as we acknowledge that a pandemic has a way of throwing a wrench into that mission.”
Call for More Tests
March 13, 11:55 a.m. The Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health is calling on the Trump administration to take action to manufacture quality test kits for the novel coronavirus.
The association, which represents deans and directors of 128 accredited institutions for public health, said in a news release that it felt compelled to speak out about test-kit availability.
“When the United States failed to participate in the World Health Organization’s collaborative effort to bring testing to the world’s nations, it made an implicit commitment to provide its own tests,” the statement reads. “It has failed to do so, and clinical and public health organizations alike do not have anywhere near the testing capacity for an aggressive response to the expanding COVID-19 crisis.”
The association is asking the administration to use emergency public health measures and funding to facilitate public-private partnerships to validate and manufacture test kits for hospitals and clinics. Without enough reliable tests to diagnose and track the virus, the country won’t be able to combat the threat, according to the association.
March 13, 11:55 a.m. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program announced that nonimmigrant students can temporarily use distance learning, either from within the U.S. or elsewhere, to continue their courses in light of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
No Student Loan Relief Expected in Coronavirus Package From Congress
March, 13 11:40 a.m. The multibillion-dollar coronavirus package being negotiated by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin isn’t expected to include a temporary suspension of student loan payments, said a Democratic House aide. Advocacy groups like Veterans Education Success and The Institute for College Access and Successhad been hoping for some temporary relief. House Democrats, however, are working on proposals to provide help.
Meanwhile, Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate's health and education committee, proposed a temporary exemption for students from repaying Pell Grants or student loans if their terms are disrupted. Under current law, Pell Grant recipients would have to return a portion of their grants to the federal government if they withdraw from school, or in this case, if their institution closes.
The bill, co-sponsored by Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, both New York Democrats, would provide $1.2 billion in funding to provide emergency financial aid to college students for basic needs created by unexpected college closures and COVID-19 related disruptions, including food, housing, health care and childcare needs.
The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators applauded the co-sponsors “for acting quickly to find a solution to support financial aid recipients, who may now find themselves in dire situations in the face of this pandemic.”
March 13, 10:50 a.m. Anonymous fliers appeared Wednesday on the campus of Bates College. They falsely claimed Bates was attempting to cope with the viral outbreak through "forced massed contamination," because the college had determined that students and all others will get COVID-19, the Lewiston Sun Journal reported.
“We are all doing our best to grapple with a very challenging public health situation, this kind of action reflects seriously poor judgment and blatant disregard for the concerns and well-being of others,” a Bates spokesman said in a message to the Bates community.
Wharton Creates Coronavirus Course
March 13, 10:30 a.m. As colleges across the country shut down or move online in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania already is taking lessons from the outbreak and putting them into a course.
Epidemics, Natural Disasters and Geopolitics: Managing Global Business and Financial Uncertainty will be a six-week, half-credit course offered remotely starting March 25, after the college’s extended spring break, according to a news release.
The course will discuss financial market reactions to the coronavirus, emotional contagion and how the virus affects the trade war with China.
“There are significant business lessons to be learned from the global response to the coronavirus outbreak, and Wharton is at the forefront of sharing valuable insights and creating a community to exchange ideas,” said Geoff Garrett, dean of the Wharton School. “This is a teachable moment for the global academic community, and this course is just one example of how Wharton is coming together to provide support during a time of heightened anxiety and ambiguity.”
March 13, 10:30 a.m. More colleges are telling students to pack up and head home for the semester due to the novel coronavirus, often leaving students with costs for moving or storing their belongings.
U-Haul has stepped forward to offer 30 days of free self-storage to college students in the U.S. and Canada in response to the outbreak, according to a news release from the company. It also includes use of the company’s portable moving and storage containers.
March 13, 10:10 a.m. Sodexo, a company that operates food and dining services on many college campuses, announced Thursday that all employees, full- and part-time, will be granted sick pay for up to 21 days if they have a confirmed case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, or are asked not to come in because of related symptoms.
This use of sick pay only will be available after an employee has used up their accrued sick time. The limited and haphazard coronavirus testing regimen in the U.S. raises questions about how many employees with the virus will be able to access tests and confirm their cases. The country is far behind others in its ability to test for the virus, a fact acknowledged Thursday by Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
“Sodexo is committed to the health and safety of our employees, our clients and the communities we serve, and that includes supporting our employees where we can if they get sick as they service our clients,” Sarosh Mistry, president of Sodexo USA, said in a statement. “Our long-standing commitment to our employees is something we will stand by, especially at a time like this.”
March 13, 9:20 a.m. Citing two positive cases of COVID-19 in the Austin area, the University of Texas at Austin on Friday morning canceled classes and closed operations. Only essential personnel should work today, the university said.
“This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities,” the NCAA said.
March 12, 4 p.m. The U.S. Department of Education has issued guidelines for institutions regarding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, and the novel coronavirus COVID-19.
Generally, FERPA doesn’t allow colleges to provide information about a student to others without their consent. But there are some exceptions that could allow colleges to send information to others without consent as they deal with the spread of coronavirus, according to Amelia Vance, director of youth and education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum. Vance said much of that guidance was already outlined in what the department released during the spread of the H1N1 virus.
The first exception allows colleges to disclose students’ personal information without their consent if that information is necessary to protect the health and safety of others. For example, if a student tests positive for coronavirus or has symptoms, the college can release a statement saying a student tested positive, without identifying the student.
Colleges could also send emails to students who shared specific classes with the sick student and identify them by name. While the guidance released today says those situations are typically rare, Vance said that likely will not be the case with coronavirus.
For those who are worried about violating regulations, Vance pointed to a 2009 FERPA regulation that said the department won’t second-guess a college’s determination in an emergency unless most people would consider it unreasonable.
The second exception allows colleges to identify students to public health departments. If the college declares it’s an emergency, it can provide that information without students’ consent. If a college said it’s not an emergency, the department could hypothetically issue a subpoena to get the information, Vance said.
Ratings Agency Details Coronavirus Risks
March 12, 2:30 p.m. Operating and enrollment pressure could build on some colleges and universities as COVID-19 spreads, according to a note out this afternoon from Fitch Ratings.
“We are taking this action to protect the safety of our student-athletes, coaches, staff and others who are essential to these activities,” Price said in a statement. “I know it is a great disappointment to our student-athletes and coaches, whose hard work and dedication to their sports and Duke is inspirational to so many, but we must first look out for their health and well-being. This is clearly an unprecedented moment for our university, our region and the wider world. As we take steps to confront the spread of this virus, I’m grateful for the cooperation and support of the entire Duke community.”
March 12, 12:25 p.m. The Big Ten, the Southeastern Conference and the American Athletic Conference will not proceed with men’s basketball conference tournaments, fearing the spread of COVID-19.
March 12, 12:10 p.m. The annual conference for the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, NASPA, has been canceled due to growing concern over the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.
The conference was scheduled to run March 28 through April 1 in Austin, Tex. After the city declared a public health emergency and the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, the organization sent out an email canceling the event.
“The colleges are working very hard to protect the health and safety of students and staff while continuing with the educational mission,” Feist said. “We are accustomed in California to dealing with disasters, and community colleges will be a critical resource as we work through this.”
"By transitioning to distance learning, CUNY will be upholding its responsibility as the largest urban public university in the country and meeting our goal of minimizing exposure to those on our campus communities to coronavirus transmission," Félix V. Matos Rodríguez, CUNY's chancellor, said in a statement.
March 11, 11:22 p.m. The new Student Relief Fund is offering to match donations of up to $5,000 for grants aimed at the hundreds of thousands of college students who are affected by campus closures over COVID-19 concerns, who may face hunger and homelessness as a result. Believe in Students, Edquity and the Rise Fund are matching the donations. The grants will be distributed as emergency aid by Edquity and the FAST Fund, which has locations in 18 cities around the U.S.
New Guidance for Colleges in New Jersey, Medical Colleges
March 11, 6:28 p.m. The New Jersey Office of the Secretary of Higher Education issued new guidance for colleges and universities to make coronavirus-related decisions that affect campus life. The guidance addressed material hardships students might face, travel directives, continuity of instruction, quarantine facilities and procedures, cleaning protocols, and efforts to reduce anxiety
The Association of American Medical Colleges released new recommendations after a meeting at the White House. They covered:
Increasing the availability and use of telehealth.
Supporting hospitals’ efforts to expand capacity to meet surging needs.
"America’s academic medical centers are committed to mounting a vigorous response to contain and mitigate COVID-19 and to providing quality care to any patient affected by this public health emergency, including the under- and uninsured," Dr. David J. Skorton, the association's president and CEO, said in a statement. "Because of their expert faculty physicians, highly trained health care teams and cutting-edge medical technology, major teaching hospitals consistently maintain a heightened level of preparedness to respond rapidly to any major event at any time."
March 11, 5:45 p.m. The Delaware Division of Public Health has announced the state’s presumptive first positive cause of COVID-19, which involves “a New Castle County man over the age of 50 who is associated with the University of Delaware community.”
The man affected was exposed to another confirmed case in a different state, according to officials. He is not severely ill. He isolated himself at home when symptoms appeared.
Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, the University of Pennsylvania is extending its spring break for all students aside from those in health-related schools or programs who have already had break or who are in clinical rotations. Penn plans to migrate classroom teaching to virtual instruction for both undergraduate and graduate classes, to begin March 23 and continue through the rest of the semester.
Kentucky students will be able to return to campus residence halls. Research and health-care activities are set to continue as planned. But all international travel sponsored or endorsed by the university has been indefinitely suspended. Any travelers arriving from Europe and Japan will be required to “self-isolate” for 14 days before being allowed on campus.
This means only essential staff and some family members will be permitted to be in the audience of the upcoming weeks of March Madness tournament games, which begin March 17. The precautions will help to protect the fans from transmitting COVID-19, as “behavioral risk mitigation strategies are the best option for slowing the spread of the disease,” the NCAA’s coronavirus advisory panel said in a statement.
“While I understand how disappointing this is for all fans of our sports, my decision is based on the current understanding of how COVID-19 is progressing in the United States,” Emmert said. “This decision is in the best interest of public health, including that of coaches, administrators, fans and, most importantly, our student-athletes. We recognize the opportunity to compete in an NCAA national championship is an experience of a lifetime for the students and their families.”
March 11, 4:45 p.m. Striking graduate students at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have put out a statement regarding the university's move to suspend face-to-face classes and begin instruction online in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The university, the students said, has weaponized the public health crisis to break the wildcat strike.
"We see the university’s turn to emergency measures as a rehearsal for a permanent shift to large scale online instruction, accelerating the creep of online teaching with little oversight, with no bargaining, and with little to no transparency," the statement said. "As UCSC looks for ways to operate in the spring after losing around 80 graduate student employees, the turn to online learning would set an alarming precedent for how a university can function without its workers."
The university responded, "As local, national and global public health recommendations increasingly shift to efforts to mitigate transmission by social distancing, UC Santa Cruz is proactively taking steps to protect our campus community. In our assessment of the current situation, we believe that this is the best action for our campus and the broader Santa Cruz community."
"This will help us reduce density and reduce the spread of this virus," the governor said in a statement on Twitter.
A statement from the governor's office later clarified that the two public university systems will "implement plans to maximize distance learning and reduce in-person classes, beginning March 19, for the remainder of the spring semester in light of the evolving novel coronavirus situation in New York. All campuses will develop plans catered to the campus and curriculum-specific needs while reducing density in the campus environment to help slow possibility for exposures to novel coronavirus. Distance learning and other options will be developed by campuses."
“The health and safety of conference participants and AAC&U staff members are our highest priorities and were the determining factors in this difficult decision,” AAC&U said in a statement.
"The Big Ten Conference’s main priority is to ensure the safety of our students, coaches, administrators, event staff, fans and media as we continue to monitor all relevant information on the COVID-19 virus," the Big Ten said in a statement.
The Ivy League on Tuesday canceled its men's and women's basketball tournaments over coronavirus concerns. Some conference basketball players criticized the move, creating an online petition calling for the tournaments to be reinstated.
March 11, 12:30 p.m. Michigan State University was one of the latest and largest universities to announce the suspension of all in-person classes, effective at noon Wednesday. The university said in a statement that health authorities were investigating and monitoring someone linked to the campus for coronavirus-related concerns.
"We must be better, as college officials, at outlining processes so students can just be students," he said. "Right now, colleges are addressing this pandemic almost solely as a public health issue, when it's actually one affecting inequalities on campuses."
March 11, 11:30 a.m. A large crowd including students from the University of Dayton gathered on the Ohio campus yesterday after the university on Tuesday suspended in-person classes due to coronavirus concerns. The university called on all residential students to leave campus by 6 p.m. Wednesday.
Students were not reacting to the coronavirus measures, the university said, but instead “wanted one last large gathering” before Dayton’s spring break, which begins Friday.
UD students gathered in large crowds on Lowes Street in the South Student Neighborhood Tuesday night in reaction to the news that university housing would close Wednesday for most students due to the spread of the coronavirus.

LIVE UPDATES: Latest news on coronavirus and higher education
College presidents fear financial -- and human -- toll of coronavirus on their campuses
Presidents' Coronavirus Concerns Virtual Thesis Defense
Presidents Fear Financial, and Human, Toll of Coronavirus
  College and university presidents are deeply worried that the coronavirus crisis could wreak havoc on their institutions' finances in the near term and, especially, beyond.
But right now, they say they're most concerned about the toll the crisis could take on the mental health of their students and employees.
Those are among the key findings of a survey of 172 campus leaders Inside Higher Ed conducted with Hanover Research last week (March 17-19), as the sweeping scope of the COVID-19 situation began to come into clearer focus in the United States.
"Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis: A Survey of College and University Presidents" is available, free, for download here.
Presidents put the mental health of students and employees atop their list of short-term concerns -- while their colleges' financial stability and potential enrollment declines are their top longer-term worries.
While nine in 10 campus leaders say mental health is their top concern, fewer than two in 10 say their institution has invested in more mental or physical health resources in response to COVID-19.
The survey first sought to gauge presidents' views on the burning platform issues -- those that were occupying their time and mindspace right now. Asked to rate their level of concern about 11 "immediate-term" issues, campus leaders appeared to prioritize the health and well-being of their people over what are clearly their anxieties about their institutions' financial security -- though only by a small margin.
The mental health of students topped the list of presidents' short-term concerns, cited by 92 percent of presidents, 37 percent of whom said they were very concerned. The mental health of employees followed next, at 88 percent. Two areas that could hurt institutions' near-term economic condition -- unbudgeted financial costs and accelerated rates of student attrition -- came next, followed by concerns about the physical health of students and employees.
The survey shows possible mismatches between presidents' top concerns and the actions they've taken so far in response. Asked which steps they had taken (as of last week) as the coronavirus impact cascaded on their campuses, their overwhelming focus has been on closing down their campuses and bringing students and employees back from abroad (or barring them from going).
But only 18 percent said they had invested in additional mental or physical health resources, which seems potentially at odds with their concerns about student and faculty mental health. That's especially true given that many colleges acknowledge having inadequate counseling and other resources to deal with mental health issues in the best of times.
Presidents who had not yet taken the actions outlined above were asked how likely their institutions were to take those same actions in the future. Of the large majority of presidents who said they had not yet invested in additional physical or mental health resources, fewer than half, 44 percent, said they expected to do so down the road.
Chuck Staben, a professor of biological sciences and former president at the University of Idaho, said it "didn't make much sense" to him that presidents were identifying mental health "as the key issue and not investing [in] it." He said he suspected campus leaders "also see this financial problem looming and don't want to invest at a time when they don't know what their finances will be," but added, "You have to invest to address your problems. If you all see this as the big problem, it's surprising you’re not investing."
Mitchell of ACE said he believed many institutions have invested significantly in student mental health pre-coronavirus, in response to growing demand for services. So "as institutions look at where are the holes they need to fill," he said, "happily student mental health is not at the front of the line because of the investments they’ve already made."
But that doesn't mean responding to student mental health concerns will be easy for institutions or presidents, Mitchell said. "Just as it's hard to move classes online, it's even harder to think about how you take all of your student supports and take them online," he said. "Presidents are grappling with taking forms of engagement that have formerly been campus-based and turn[ing] them into services online or at a distance."
As seen in the chart above, almost every college ended in-person instruction as the coronavirus hit and moved all teaching and learning into remote or virtual settings, typically after pausing instruction over planned or extended spring breaks to help prepare professors and students alike for the transition. In general, Inside Higher Ed's reporting suggests that the process has generally gone smoothly in its early days, with relatively few complaints from students or significant interruptions in delivery.
That question -- will colleges be able to create an online learning experience that satisfies and serves students well if the coronavirus continues to curtail traditional enrollment? -- may at least partially underlie some of the presidents' long-term concerns for their institutions.
Presidents' most significant long-term concerns related to COVID-19 relate to broader financial and enrollment issues, with 89 percent saying they are concerned (46 percent very much so) about overall financial stability and 88 percent (57 percent very concerned) about declines in overall enrollment.
The enrollment questions are plentiful. Will existing students, once they've spent the spring term learning from their homes, choose to enroll at a college closer to home (and potentially a lower-cost local one) than return to their residential college in another state, especially if the health situation remains unsettled?
The overall financial questions are even more varied. In addition to whatever enrollment hit colleges might take, institutions almost certainly face a wide array of unexpected expenses from the onset of the coronavirus situation, from demands for room and board refunds (which concern 62 percent of presidents, and which numerous institutions are already paying) to increased cleaning bills.
The focus on finances is amplified by presidents' answers to questions about where they most need or would like additional operational or government support to "navigate beyond the COVID-19 crisis."
More presidents cite a desire for financial health and operational planning support (60 percent) than for anything else, followed by help with faculty training and development (53 percent), and instructional technology development (48 percent).

A biology professor in New Orleans describes the challenges of teaching students about the coronavirus (opinion)
As news of the coronavirus outbreak erupted in January, the spring semester had just kicked off at my institution, Loyola University New Orleans. I held tight to my syllabus and rallied my students for a journey through the central dogma of molecular biology.
We were studying the flow of genetic information in cells, but it was impossible to ignore the deluge of information surrounding this new respiratory disease. Images of masked health-care workers, quarantines and the climbing casualty count drew attention to the faraway city of Wuhan, China. Meanwhile, the pathogenic virus dubbed SARS-CoV-2 masqueraded as asymptomatic baggage on airplanes and cruise ships. As we arranged our desks in a circle and discussed the classic experiments leading to a vaccine for bacterial pneumonia, the first U.S. COVID-19 patient disembarked at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
In February, my immune system and teaching portfolio were quite literally naïve to the virus. I felt compelled to teach the outbreak when it was seemingly distant and contained. I could draw the virus on the board, embellish it with crown-shaped proteins and sketch a genome of primitive RNA inside it. We could ponder the mechanisms of information transfer for a clever virus that hijacks cells to mass-produce itself. It felt like a timely topic to assign as class dispersed for Mardi Gras break.
The challenge of teaching an outbreak in real time is sifting through mountains of information to uncover the teachable gems. In the early weeks, social media was ablaze with sensationalist headlines, conspiracy theories and rapidly evolving statistics. Peer-reviewed studies were scarce, and I was searching for a primary study that laid out the early discovery process from the epicenter of the outbreak.
I settled on a preliminary report from a preprint server called BioRxiv (Bio Archive), “Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin.” The report was bulging with viral genome sequences from a handful of initial patients and sparkling with immunofluorescent images ripe for class discussion. While I was skeptical of science that had not yet been peer reviewed, I was also eager to highlight fast tracks for releasing data in the midst of a public health crisis. The introduction section referenced only 198 confirmed cases of COVID-19, so this study marked the early moments of the outbreak.
By the time we circled back for a class discussion in early March, a stark reality hit the marker board: the outbreak had escalated into a pandemic. “There is no point in listing out the countries,” a student protested. It was everywhere, including the United States. We did not linger on this point. Instead, we pivoted into a lively discussion about social media as it interfaces with public health.
The preliminary report we analyzed received modest attention online: 1,500 likes on Facebook, tweets in multiple languages and a handful of mentions on random blogs. Sifting through these social annotations hinted at a new mechanism for spreading science. Three different versions of the preliminary report were posted, each with its own series of online comments probing technical details and proposing theories about the origin of the virus.
The data were ultimately published in Nature, fast-tracked through peer review in just nine days. The median submission to acceptance time for this prestigious journal is over 200 days, a dangerously long time to withhold information at the start of an outbreak. Yet even during the expedited window of peer review, the number of confirmed cases jumped to 2,761 in China. Peer review would legitimize the study for the scientific community, but it would do little to halt the pandemic on its own.
Online news outlets have reported on COVID-19 more than two billion times since December 2019, while PubMed contains just over 1,000 indexed scientific papers on the topic. The imbalance between rapid-fire news and vetted scientific information creates a dangerous infodemic. Students reflected on ways that social media can interfere with public health messaging and international relations during a crisis. For example, a student pointed to troubling tweets claiming the virus was stolen from a lab in Canada. Another student called out a myth linking melanin and coronavirus immunity. After her analysis on Black Twitter, she shared, “It’s pretty frightening that it took the diagnoses of celebrities like Idris Elba to debunk this claim.” In a move to hold social media accountable for its role in the crisis, Democratic congressman Bobby Rush of Illinois confronted Facebook and Twitter CEOs and implored them to combat the spread of misinformation online.
Sensing the urgency of teaching in this moment, I loosened my grip on the syllabus and created classroom space for deconstructing the diagnostic tests. Using a table of patient symptoms and other data from the paper, students predicted which patients might harbor the virus and drew hypothetical results for the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) on the board. They included the necessary controls and discussed why these controls were essential to interpret the data. The path from patient to diagnostic test seemed straightforward in this neatly packaged paper. In contrast, the implementation of robust testing procedures has been quite messy in the United States. Early test kits released by the CDC had problems with a key ingredient necessary to validate the test, the negative control. Now, shortages of test kits, swabs and masks threaten efforts to flatten the curve.
Nine days after bringing the science of the outbreak into the classroom, community spread in New Orleans was well documented. Perhaps the virus arrived during Mardi Gras season, a time when the city booms with tourism, parades and revelry. Colored toilet paper tossed from floats still clings to the live oaks along the parade route, a gaudy reminder of national resource shortages.
Our PCR gels were running on 200 volts in the lab when the announcement from President Tania Tetlow hit our devices. Like all other colleges in New Orleans, Loyola University New Orleans would immediately shift to remote learning for the rest of the spring semester. Within a matter of days, I needed to assume an online identity, ramp up remote teaching tools and build a home office. While difficult to swallow, this unprecedented social distancing experiment endeavors to protect our community and dampen the outbreak.
Amazingly, PCR was successful for every single student in the lab that afternoon: products in the right lanes and clean controls. This would be the equivalent of implementing a robust diagnostic test in the heat of an outbreak. It felt like my March Madness pick had just sunk 14 consecutive free throws to win the game, wearing lab coats and gloves.
Our online personas must cultivate a tight scientific learning community during this time of social distancing. Empowering our emerging scientists to implement rapid diagnostic tests, launch vaccines and clinical trials, debunk pseudoscience, and continuously strive for social justice will be our pedagogical gift to the future.

Why infectious diseases are on the rise
How long will social distancing last?
In just a couple of months the new coronavirus that emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan has spread around the world, sparking a race to find treatments and vaccines against it.
The human race is locked in a battle against something five million times smaller than us. The novel coronavirus that has emerged from the Wuhan in China has gone from an unknown enemy to feared worldwide, in a matter of months.
As it continues to spread around the world, bringing panic with it, scientists are striving to develop ways of fighting this previously unknown threat. Sophisticated computer modelling is being used to track and predict its transmission, while virologists are attempting to engineer a vaccine. Others are seeking drug treatments that can help those who fall ill with the infection.
But this is not the first coronavirus scientists have encountered, and defeating them is harder than you might think. Even after decades of trying, coronaviruses are formidable foes.
• The viruses that could save humanity
• The mysterious viruses far worse than flu
• The places that escaped a deadly pandemic
Some of the most common and challenging diseases are caused by coronaviruses. One of the viruses that causes the common cold is a coronavirus, and we have yet to find an effective vaccine or cure for it despite years of work. Both the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) outbreaks were also caused by coronaviruses. (Find out the truth about traditional remedies for the common cold.)

They all belong to a large group of viruses that can infect both humans and animals and can occasionally jump the species barrier. Mers, for example, was first reported in 2012 when a young boy was infected after close contact with a camel. Since then, there have been many reported cases of people being infected by camels.
The new coronavirus, which has been provisionally named 2019-nCoV, appears to be a young virus that may have emerged sometime in early December, according to attempts to trace its origins. Based on analysis of its genetic code, 2019-nCOV was initially thought to have jumped to humans from bats. The human virus has been found to share many genetic similarities to two coronaviruses in bats, but others have suggested it may have come from snakes, although this idea has been widely dismissed by virologists.
Most recently, endangered pangolins, whose scales are heavily used in Chinese traditional medicine, are being proposed as a likely conduit for the virus. Some researchers have proposed that a bat coronavirus may have combined with another coronavirus in pangolins to produce the strain now infecting humans. (Read more about the search for "patient zero" in the coronavirus outbreak.)
The name coronavirus itself derives from the Latin for crown, because they are sphere-shaped but covered in spikes, which resembles a crown
But while the first cases likely occurred in people who had close contact with infected animals, it seems that most new cases from this 2019-nCoV are being passed human to human. “We believe it came from a local market, and that market is now closed,” says Christl Donnelly, a statistical epidemiologist working at Imperial College London and Oxford University. “So, it certainly is being maintained by human transmission.”
Coronaviruses typically target the upper respiratory tract, causing a range of illnesses which can potentially include pneumonia. But there is growing evidence they can move further down the body, and also affect the central nervous system, causing long-term neurological damage.
The name coronavirus itself derives from the Latin for crown, because they are sphere-shaped but covered in spikes, which resembles a crown. (Learn about the tricky politics surrounding the new name for the Wuhan coronavirus.)
Coronaviruses get their name from the crown-like spikes on the protein shell that encases their genetic material (Credit: Getty Images)
Contained within this prickly shell is a string of single-stranded genetic code called RNA. As they spread from host to host, this RNA code can become easily jumbled, allowing coronaviruses to mutate quickly. This increases the chances of them gaining the ability to switch species as well as alter other characteristics, such as how infectious they are and the severity of illness they cause. It is also why so many new kinds of coronaviruses keep cropping up. It’s also why they are so hard to fight – it’s hard to hit a constantly changing target with vaccines and drugs.
In order to get a reliable model of how the disease spreads, Donnelly says, there are a few things we need to know about the virus. First, how long someone might be infected by it before developing symptoms. This is called the incubation period. Second, we need to know how long someone with the virus remains infectious for, and in cases where patients do not recover, how quickly the virus can cause death. “That helps us estimate the case fatality rate,” says Donnelly.
Super spreaders shed far larger numbers of the virus particles than other patients, increasing the chance they will infect someone else
Another important factor is the reproduction number, which is how many other people someone with the disease will infect. Donnelly and her colleagues have estimated the new coronavirus to have a reproduction number of about 2.6. “If that number is greater than one, then you expect there to be an outbreak,” she says.
There can be great variation in the number of people a patient might infect. One patient with the new coronavirus, for example, infected 14 health care workers. These individuals are classed as “super spreaders”, and are responsible for a disproportionate share of the spread of the disease. This is because in a cough or sneeze they shed far larger numbers of the virus particles than other patients, increasing the chance they will infect someone else.
This presents a particular challenge when trying to contain an outbreak. A super spreader can enable diseases to spread faster. Both the Sars and Mers outbreaks were complicated by the role of super spreaders.

But identifying exactly who a super spreader is can be difficult. Who becomes a super spreader is both a combination of their own biology, the virus itself and the environment they are in. Some people’s immune systems allow them to carry the virus with few or mild symptoms. This means they will often move around and even travel long distances with the virus. Others, however, can suffer the opposite – heavy symptoms that cause them to sneeze and cough a lot, and so spread the disease more to those around them.
General precautions such as wearing face masks, hand-washing and stringent quarantine procedures can help to limit the spread.
Even if it can be diagnosed quickly, finding an effective treatment for a virus like this is famously difficult
New technology is also making it easier to diagnose specific viruses in the first place, which will help efforts to not only contain the outbreak, but also make it easier to understand how it spreads. Around the world, scientists are trying to develop new rapid diagnostic tools that can be used. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a DNA based diagnostic kit for the new virus that can produce results in around four hours, but needs expensive laboratory equipment to work. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, and a number of biotechnology companies are reportedly working on faster approaches that do not require specialised equipment.
Even if it can be diagnosed quickly, finding an effective treatment for a virus like this is famously difficult.
The main way of treating a viral infection is to find small molecules that prevent the virus from replicating inside our cells. These “antivirals” interfere with the virus’s ability to enter our cells, disrupts its ability to hijack our cellular machinery to replicate, or prevents it from escaping infected cells.
Unfortunately, there are not many effective antiviral drugs for coronaviruses. One potential treatment for 2019-nCOV is an antiviral treatment initially developed to combat the Ebola virus. It was given to the first patient in the US with the new coronavirus, who went on to recover within days. Doctors who treated him say they cannot be sure the drug, called remdesivir, was responsible for his recovery, but other research has shown it is effective against the Mers coronavirus in mice. The drug is known as a broad-spectrum antiviral, meaning it can block the ability of a number of viruses from making copies of themselves.

Further research has indicated that remdesivir was able to inhibit the ability of the 2019-nCOV from infecting human cells in laboratory tests, but it has still to be approved by regulators for use against 2019-nCOV in patients. The same study also found that chloroquine, a medication used to prevent and treat malaria, was also effective against the virus. A clinical trial involving two drugs used for treating HIV is also underway at a hospital in Wuhan, China.
The speed with which coronaviruses mutate also means they can potentially develop resistance to anti-viral treatments.
The speed at which coronaviruses mutate and so change their characteristics makes them hard to vaccinate against
But there are some more radical cures in the pipeline. One piece of research published last year looked at using quantum dots, particles a few nanometres in size with unusual conducting properties caused by quantum mechanics, that appear to be able to inhibit the infection of cells by human coronaviruses.
Meanwhile, there is also a race to develop a vaccine against the novel coronavirus. If a certain proportion of a community can be given immunity to a virus through a vaccine, its spread can be controlled.

The speed at which coronaviruses mutate and so change their characteristics makes them hard to vaccinate against. Vaccines tend to train the immune system to target a particular feature, such as a protein structure on the shell of the virus. But by continually altering its appearance, our immune systems find it hard to recognise different infections. It is partly why the common cold has been so difficult to develop a vaccine against.
Developing vaccines can be a long and expensive process. At the end of January it was announced the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) had awarded pharmaceutical company Inovio a grant of up to $9 million (£6.8 million) to develop a vaccine to the coronavirus within 16 weeks.
A vaccine works by training the immune system to recognise a portion of the virus. This helps to ensure the person receiving the vaccine does not become sick, but they do develop antibodies that work against that virus in any future infection. But getting the right version of the virus to use can often take many attempts.
The new coronavirus may have jumped species to humans from pangolins, which are often sold for use in traditional Chinese medicine (Credit: Getty Images)
“A mutant is created by looking at the sequence for the gene of interest, or length of sequence of DNA, and changing one, two, or more letters of that DNA sequence” says Emily Leproust, chief executive of Twist Bioscience, a company based in San Francisco, which is working with Inovio on developing the vaccine. Twist’s role is to produce large quantities of precise sequences of DNA, to help speed up the process.
“There are mutants that will be more virulent and those that will be less,” says Leproust. “In many respects, it’s similar to what viruses do when they mutate to create a new strain.” The difference is, when it is done in a lab, it can be done in a controlled manner. This synthetic DNA is almost identical to the live virus, but it is unable to replicate itself and spread.
Twist is also working with Vanderbilt University, under DARPA’s Pandemic Prevention Platform, which aims to develop vaccine therapies within 60 days of an outbreak starting.
Another way a vaccine can be developed is by isolating the cells from a patient who has recovered from the disease. “These cells can then be screened [for antibodies], and the common areas of these antibodies can be reproduced to see if it is an active and effective vaccine,” says Leproust.
But it is still an open question as to whether a treatment or a vaccine will be found within a matter of months or if it will take years. Until then, says Donnelly, all that can be done is to continue to monitor the virus and try to stop it spreading.

Union Square Hospitality Group Lays Off 2,000 Workers Due to Coronavirus Measures
After several days of keeping its entire workforce on payroll after shutting down its restaurants, one of the city’s most prominent restaurant companies, Union Square Hospitality Group, is laying off about 2,000 employees, a restaurant spokesperson confirms to Eater. The layoffs, which represent 80 percent of the company’s total workforce at more than 20 restaurants, take effect immediately.
Hourly and salaried employees at both the restaurants and overarching corporate office have been laid off, the spokesperson tells Eater, due to a “near complete elimination of revenue” at the company. The staffers who remain are there to keep “basic corporate functions” operating, and executives at the company have voluntarily reduced their salaries. USHG will be absorbing all costs related to health insurance for all employees through mid-April.
When the restaurants reopen, staffers have been directed to re-apply for their jobs, according to information in an internal company email that was sent today. However, each former employee’s tenure and accrued paid time off will resume as if there wasn’t a layoff, and the company will waive the 90-day and one-year waiting period for access to health benefits and 401K benefits, respectively.
Last Friday, the company had announced that it would be temporarily shutting down all of its restaurants in the midst of the new coronavirus crisis. USHG decided to forgo any delivery or takeout options at any of its restaurants, the spokesperson says, because the company “didn’t feel comfortable” continuing to operate with little clarity on whether it would be safe for their employees or customers to do so, given the dangers of COVID-19.
In a statement to Eater, Meyer emphasized the need for government assistance — at the city, state, and federal level — in order to support restaurants and their workers. He pledged his “immediate service” to helping to come up with a “full emergency relief package” for restaurant and bar workers affected by the crisis.
“In the 35-year history of Union Square Hospitality Group, this is, without a doubt, the most challenging period any of us has ever encountered as leaders,” Meyer said in the statement.

New Amsterdam Cancels Upcoming Pandemic Episode for Obvious Reasons
NBC’s New Amsterdam, a medical drama that is not actually new or set in the Netherlands (or dare we say, not a very good show), has shelved an episode about a deadly, flulike pandemic that hits New York City — due to, of course, the coronavirus pandemic ravaging America and beyond. Per Deadline, the episode (originally titled “Pandemic” but renamed to “Our Doors Are Always Open”), was set to air on April 7. However, the network decided to pull the episode for the foreseeable future, with plans to air it on a later date. “The world needs a lot less fiction right now, and a lot more facts,” New Amsterdam showrunner and creator David Schulner explained, noting how the episode was written in 2019. “Sometimes, what the mirror reflects back is too horrifying to look at. We shot a fictional pandemic episode right before a real pandemic hit. People are dying in real life. Do we really want to watch fake people die too?”
Schulner noted that numerous New Amsterdam staffers are now sick, such as actor Daniel Dae Kim, who recently tested positive for the coronavirus after guest-starring in an episode. (In cruel irony, Kim would’ve made his debut as a trauma surgeon in the pandemic episode.) New York City, where the show is filmed, has become an epicenter for the virus in recent days.

According to a statement from Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit educational organization behind Sesame Street, the beloved brand and its cast of Muppets will launch the Caring for Each Other Initiative, which offers “a broad variety of free resources to help children and families during the coronavirus pandemic.” The initiative features resources “designed to help parents provide comfort and manage anxiety, as well as help with creating routines, fostering playful learning at home, and staying physically and mentally healthy.”
The Sesame Street website already has a number of resources available, including a playlist of “Fun at Home” activity videos, an animated “How to Wash Your Hands” video, and downloadable coloring pages that feature Elmo walking you through the steps of — what else? — how to properly wash your hands. The website also features an “expanded offering” of free on-demand recent episodes of Sesame Street, free eBooks available for download, and a variety of tool kits for parents, including “Self Care for Parents,” “Creating Routines,” and “Talking With Your Child About COVID-19.” The site will be regularly updated, which is great news for caregivers and even better news for bored, lonely, anxious adults in social isolation who have taken to playing old Polly Pocket flash games.

6ix9ine Requests Early Release From Prison Due to Coronavirus Scare
Tekashi 6ix9ine, real name Daniel Hernandez, has only a few months left to serve after snitching on the Nine Trey Gangster Bloods, but he and his lawyer are concerned he won’t make it that far. Citing a confirmed case of the coronavirus at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, 6ix9ine’s lawyer, Lance Lazzaro, wrote a letter to a judge obtained by Inner City Press, asking for him to be let out of Queens Detention Center early due to the rapidly spreading outbreak. The letter comes just one day after news that Harvey Weinstein tested positive in his upstate prison. Lazzaro wrote that the rapper’s asthma, which has hospitalized him several times in the past, could put him at high risk if he contracts the disease. Lazzaro also notes that 6ix9ine had bronchitis and sinusitis last October. “Mr. Hernandez has been complaining to prison officials this week about shortness of breath, but apparently the warden of his facility will not allow Mr. Hernandez to go to the hospital despite the recommendation of the facility’s medial doctor that Mr. Hernandez be treated by a doctor at a hospital,” he wrote.
Update, March 25: The judge overseeing Tekashi 6ix9ine’s case denied the rapper’s coronavirus-spurred request for home confinement, writing that he “lacks the legal authority” to grant early release. Manhattan Federal Court Judge Paul Engelmayer said in a three-page order that he was “constrained” and couldn’t act on the rapper’s petition, explaining that early release would be up to the federal Bureau of Prisons. Engelmayer did express concern for Tekashi, real name Daniel Hernandez, saying that he “did not know and could not have known that the final four months of Mr. Hernandez’s sentence would be served at a time of a worldwide pandemic to which persons with asthma, like Mr. Hernandez, have heightened vulnerability … Had the Court known that sentencing Mr. Hernandez to serve the final four months of his term in a federal prison would have exposed him to a heightened health risk, the Court would have directed that these four months be served instead in home confinement,” Engelmayer wrote.

CORONAVIRUS MAR. 27, 2020
Disney is keeping its parks in the United States closed indefinitely. Both Disneyland in California and Disney World in Florida are affected by the announcement, with the Walt Disney Company saying in a statement published by Variety, “While there is still much uncertainty with respect to the impacts of COVID-19, the safety and well-being of our guests and employees remains The Walt Disney Company’s top priority.” The company added, “As a result of this unprecedented pandemic and in line with direction provided by health experts and government officials, Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort will remain closed until further notice. The Walt Disney Company has been paying its cast members since the closure of the parks, and in light of this ongoing and increasingly complex crisis, we have made the decision to extend paying hourly parks and resorts cast members through April 18.”
For a few hours on March 12, it looked like the Disneyland amusement park in Southern California would remain open, despite mass suspensions of sports leagues, concerts, festivals, and the like due to fears about enabling the spread of the coronavirus. But that holdout didn’t last long, and as the cascade of business and event closures poured in, Disney got in line with safety measures concerning mass gatherings. On March 12, Disney issued the following statement about its U.S. closures:
While there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 at Disneyland Resort, after carefully reviewing the guidelines of the Governor of California’s executive order and in the best interest of our guests and employees, we are proceeding with the closure of Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure, beginning the morning of March 14 through the end of the month. The Hotels of Disneyland Resort will remain open until Monday, March 16 to give guests the ability to make necessary travel arrangements; Downtown Disney will remain open. We will monitor the ongoing situation and follow the advice and guidance of federal and state officials and health agencies. Disney will continue to pay cast members during this time. Disneyland Resort will work with guests who wish to change or cancel their visits, and will provide refunds to those who have hotel bookings during this closure period. Please contact The Walt Disney Travel Company for questions and cancellations at 714-520-5050.

How the Late-Night Shows Are Handling Coronavirus Quarantine For some of them, the show must go on … at home.
The coronavirus has forced all of the late-night shows to rethink the way they release content, with most of them pivoting to segments taped and produced from the hosts’ and staffs’ homes. But if you’re a fan of comedian Conner O’Malley, you know that late-night shows filmed in weird places isn’t a new invention — it’s something O’Malley has mastered for years. Whether it’s an absurd parody of Johnny Carson or hosting a talk show while swimming in a river, O’Malley was basically born for this moment of quarantine. We’re all starved for weird and innovative content, and his latest offering, streamed live last night, gives us just that.
So, what is it, exactly? Basically, O’Malley rides his bike around a deserted Manhattan at night while screaming. He blasts Katy Perry and reads monologue jokes about a nonexistent Frasier reboot from a sheet of paper he’s holding in one hand while steering his bike down the street with the other. For some people, maybe there’s something comforting about late-night hosts working from home right now. But for others, the true comfort is in someone like O’Malley, who is embracing the chaos and confusion of a place like New York during a pandemic rather than hiding from it — while still practicing social distancing, of course. He is, in his own words, the “woke Regis Philbin but on acid and from hell” that we need right now. The long bike ride, the open spaces, the loud screaming — while you’re trapped at home you can experience all these things vicariously through O’Malley’s livestream, and it’s extremely satisfying.
The livestream is broken up into two YouTube clips, which are well worth the watch if you have an hour to spare. He rides by New York late-night landmarks like the Daily Show and Late Show studios. He yells at Greg Kinnear for trying to steal his show idea. He educates viewers about the virus (“Two ways that it is impossible for you to transmit COVID-19: random acts of kindness and paying it forward”). He “makes new money” by filling his mouth with a page from The Wall Street Journal then mixing it with mouthwash before spitting it out. But the most important part? He really, really, really just wants you to like him. “I know I look like I’m the guy on the lacrosse team that’s gonna take it too far, but I won’t, okay?” he yells at the camera. “I’m gonna be the nicest guy you ever met! I’m a good guy! Please! Like me! Don’t be afraid of me! Like me! Think that I’m okay! Think that I won’t hurt you, because it’s true!”

Rumor has it, Pagliacci is completely booked up for weeks, so if you want to avoid lingering in the waiting room, you better watch(men) the latest celeb handwashing PSA from your favorite prestige superhero drama. On Friday, the cast of HBO’s Watchmen demonstrated how to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, just as Master demands of you. In a fun twist, Regina King, Jean Smart, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Tim Blake Nelson, Dustin Kyle Ingram, Sara Vickers, Tom Mison, and Andrew Howard give you — if not in-character directions — something close to it. And if you’re still out here, not clear how to go about protecting yourself from the coronavirus pandemic, Howard’s Red Scare, complete with tattered mask, puts it in words anyone can understand: “Wash your filthy hands, and stay the fuck home. It’s simple.”

Here's how the novel coronavirus outbreak unfolded
March 19 coronavirus news
The US is preparing for the pandemic to last up to 18 months or longer.

Health
Our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic has moved here
CNN's town hall on the coronavirus, addressing facts, fears, and medical guidance, has now finished. Here's what was discussed:
Vaccine trials: CNN medical analyst Dr. Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant professor of infectious diseases, said it is just the "very beginning" of a long process of research and studies.
Reinfection: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said while "there is no design study that has proven that you are 'protected'" from getting reinfected, "projecting what we know about viruses, I would say that there is a very good chance that you're protected."
Young people need to take pandemic seriously: "We are getting more and more information that someone can transmit even when they are asymptomatic. So in order to protect oneself, society and particularly the vulnerable people, we've really got to adhere to the physical separation," said Fauci.
Increased contact tracing can help save lives: Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program said that, "it is possible to do contact tracing even under the most difficult circumstances, but it does require a real scale-up in public health capacity."
Assessing your own mental health: Psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer  likened the public's response to the coronavirus to the stages of grief, and encouraged people to find "coping strategies" to keep their stress levels down.
How do you assess and manage your own mental health?
Question: At CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta asked psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer about the best ways for people to manage and assess there own mental health, especially considering that for many, the pandemic is not a single traumatic even but rather a long period of significant change.
Answer: Schmelzer likened the public's response to the coronavirus to the stages of grief, and encouraged people to find "coping strategies" to keep their stress levels down.
BREAKING: California governor orders all 40 million residents to stay at home to limit outbreak
All 40 million residents in the state of California have been ordered to stay home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
The state is one of the worst affected in the US after Washington and New York. There are now 910 coronavirus cases in California, including 19 deaths.
New York has at least 5,298 cases, while Washington has at least 1,376 confirmed cases.
Town hall: How should grandparents explain social distancing to their young grandchildren?
Question: Jackie Stephens, a 65-year-old grandmother with underlying health conditions from Idaho, wants to know how best to explain to her "timid, easily frightened" 3-year-old grandson that he can't come into physical contact with her.
Will the Olympics go ahead? The coming weeks will tell: "I have no reason to believe they're not making progress in Japan," said Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program.
"And the Olympics is a major global event. And I think Japan still has hope the Olympics will happen, but that is going to be based on a risk management decision. And obviously the government of Japan will not make a decision to go ahead if there is danger to athletes, danger to spectators. And a lot of that will depend on how the disease evolves in the coming few weeks."
What other measures is India taking? The Indian government is directing state governments to advise citizens above 65 and children below 10 to stay home. This excludes public representatives, medical professionals and government employees. 
States have also been requested to enforce work from home for private sector employees, except those working in emergency or essential services.
There are more than 190 confirmed cases in India and four deaths.
Town hall: Increased contact tracing can help save lives in this crisis
CNN's Anderson Cooper and Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta speak to Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program about the US' capacity to test for the coronavirus and do contact tracing.
Learning from Italy: "I think other countries really, really need to step up and learn the lessons that are being learned in Italy right now. We have to push this virus back. It's not just enough to do social distancing. It's good to have that, it's great to separate people, but we have to be able to go after the virus," Ryan said.
Tailoring responses: "You've got 50 states. You've got a different situation in each of those states. And you need to tailor the responses in each of those states. And if you've got a chance you need to go after the virus. And contact tracing and isolation of cases is still a strategy that can be used," Ryan said.
Need to identify cases: "It's really important we identify all confirmed cases. We need to test suspected cases. We need those cases to be isolated, and it is difficult in a very intense environment. It's difficult to do the kind of detailed contact tracing. In Ebola, at the peak of the outbreak, we were tracing 25,000 contacts a day in the middle of a war zone. It is possible to do contact tracing even under the most difficult circumstances, but it does require a real scale-up in public health capacity. And where that can be done and the virus can be pushed back, we can save lives," Ryan said.
CNN's Dan Simon and Gary Tuchman joined the coronavirus town hall from San Francisco and Georgia's St. Simons Island.

(CNN)As Chinese President Xi Jinping passed an apartment complex last week during his tour of Wuhan, ground zero of the global coronavirus pandemic, he looked up and waved back at rows of residents who -- still under lockdown -- greeted him behind masks from their apartment windows.
"What's for sure is that Xi Jinping cannot hear any genuine voices at all," said resident Zhang Yi of the leader's visit, his first since the outbreak emerged in Wuhan in December.
Zhang, and many others like him, have been sealed off from the outside world since late January, when the metropolis of 11 million was placed under a state-imposed lockdown to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus -- and their frustrations have been mounting.
Chinese President Xi Jinping waved to residents quarantined at home in a residential community udring his tour of Wuhan, ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic.
When the epidemic was at its most severe, many Wuhan patients said they were unable to get treated due to an extreme shortage of hospital beds and medical resources. Now, as the number of new reported cases in China slows to a trickle, millions of residents are still restricted by the government to their homes; they're not even allowed to go outside to shop for groceries. Instead, the residents CNN spoke to said they have to rely on designated neighborhood committees to make group orders for daily necessities -- often at a higher price.
The coronavirus has now spread to more than 140 countries and territories worldwide, and a growing number of governments -- like that of Italy, Spain and the Philippines -- have imposed lockdowns like the one first introduced in Wuhan. The strict measures in the Chinese city have been credited with slowing the outbreak: for the past three days, Wuhan has reported new cases in the single-digits compared with nearly 4,000 per day a month ago. However, the lockdown has also come at a cost to millions of people.
Xi's tour -- which included a visit to a neighborhood community center and a video conference with medical workers and a patient -- ended smoothly with no drama, but the anger and frustration in Wuhan remains.
The city has borne the brunt of the outbreak, accounting for the majority of infected cases and deaths in China. But even people not stricken with the disease have had their lives turned upside down by unprecedented quarantine measures.
She's been living in constant anxiety, worrying about what skyrocketing food prices could mean for her family when the money runs out. Her father, a delivery man, was the only breadwinner in the household, but he has not earned anything for weeks due to the lockdown. Now, the only income supporting the family of three is the small state pension collected by Li's grandmother each month, she said.
The cost of vegetables has soared at least three or four times since the implementation of the lockdown, while regular pork ribs can cost more than $10 a pound, Li said. Other angry Wuhan residents have also posted costly grocery receipts on social media.
While some more affluent families may have enough savings to rely on during the outbreak, families such as Li's are being squeezed.
Apart from the financial burden, life under lockdown has also taken a mental toll. "Living under an enclosed condition for so long, people find themselves constantly in anxiety," Li said.
The most trivial things can quickly flare into shouting matches: her dad playing loud videos on the phone while she is trying to study, or smoking cigarettes despite her repeated protests. Like her, Li's father is also fed up with being stuck at home.
Scientists have already started to study the psychological toll of the outbreak and the ensuing quarantine measures. A study published in the China-based journal General Psychiatry this month found nearly 35% of 52,730 respondents across China had experienced psychological distress during the epidemic, based on their reported frequency of anxiety, depression, specific phobias, cognitive change and other symptoms over the course of a week.
Li said the government should bear the blame for the suffering of Wuhan residents. "If they had made public the situation of the outbreak earlier, and had quarantined those patients who had already shown symptoms, I don't think we would have to come to the point of lockdown," she said.
Xu Honglan, deputy mayor of Wuhan, explained that during the epidemic, logistics and labor costs were three times higher than usual, driving up food prices. She also said the government was going to take four major measures to fix the problem including releasing more of the government's reserve of frozen meat and selling it at 15% below the market price.
A few Wuhan residents have told CNN that food prices have indeed gone down slightly compared to the start of the city lockdown. However, not everyone has benefitted.
It was necessary, Wang reportedly said, "to carry out gratitude education among the citizens of the whole city, so that they thank (President Xi Jinping), thank the Chinese Communist Party, heed the party, walk with the party, and create strong positive energy," according to remarks published by the state-run Global Times.
China wants to take a victory lap over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak
With his mother now in the hospital treating her swelling legs and heart problems, Zhang said he was determined to point out local government missteps -- even though police had visited him on Wednesday, warning him to keep quiet, he said.
"Somebody has to step out and speak up," he said. "I don't want to be one of those who have lost every member of their family to the virus and yet never spoke up."
Whistle blower doctor Li Wenliang died of the very virus he had tried to warn others about.
"Since the outbreak, especially since the lockdown, we Wuhan people are like a lone island. (It's as if) we don't have any right to be informed," she said.
"The lack of freedom of speech and freedom of the press is the culprit of the secondary disaster of this epidemic. So many innocent people have died, including professional health care workers, yet relevant departments are still deleting critical posts online and silencing people from speaking up -- they're simply ignorant, senseless and shameless," Wang said.
At the beginning of January, Wuhan authorities punished medical workers who tried to warn others about the emergence of the coronavirus. One doctor, Li Wenliang, was reprimanded by police for spreading "rumors" and later died of the virus he contracted from a patient.
The whistleblower's death set off a remarkable storm of calls for free speech across the country. In response, the government has doubled down on its attempts to control the narrative.
Just as Xi made his tour around Wuhan, the censors were again busy containing a story about another Wuhan doctor, who reportedly informed colleagues like Li about the emergence of the coronavirus.
This Chinese doctor tried to save lives, but was silenced. Now he has coronavirus
"If I have an opportunity to stand in front of President Xi, I will tell him: 'Wuhan is a heroic city, and the people of Wuhan are heroic people. But heroes will have to sacrifice. We don't want to die an obscure death, we want to live with a clear (conscience and mind)," she said.

Bolivia closes border to curb coronavirus spread
Bolivia’s borders will be closed due to the ongoing threat of coronavirus, Interim President Jeanine Áñez announced in a statement released by her office on Tuesday.
Effective Thursday, only Bolivian citizens and residents may enter the country, the statement said. Travelers entering the country must follow protocols implemented by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization.
A US state heavily dependent on tourism dollars is making the extraordinary request for visitors to stay away due to the coronavirus. 
Ige said additional steps are coming, as they will screen all passengers disembarking from cruise ships starting Friday. Physicians will check the temperature of each passenger and conduct interviews about their health. Ige said they intend to do the same screenings for airport arrivals as soon as possible.

The governor of Nevada is strongly advising as many residents as possible to stay home indefinitely to slow the spread of coronavirus.
When Trump was asked at the coronavirus task force briefing whether he was considering closing the US land borders on Tuesday, he said, "I don't want to say that, but we are discussing things with Canada and we're discussing things with Mexico, quite honestly, and again, the relationship is outstanding with both, outstanding. We just signed our deal, the USMCA, and the relationship is very strong." 
California public schools will likely remain closed for the remainder of the school year to prevent spread of novel coronavirus, Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news conference Tuesday.
Nearly all school districts in the state, with a total student body of 6.1 million students, have been closed in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Sonoma County joined nine other Northern California counties on Tuesday, ordering residents to shelter in place to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus, raising the total number of residents under the orders in the region to nearly 8 million.
“In light of the recent cases of local transmission of COVID-19 in the County, we are taking proactive action to curtail the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Sundari Mase, Sonoma County's interim health officer. 
The air traffic control tower at Chicago Midway International Airport has temporarily closed after several technicians at the facility tested positive for coronavirus, the Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday.

European countries are writing blank checks to save their economies from coronavirus
Small business owner on coronavirus: I'm losing $100k a month
London (CNN Business)European governments are writing blank checks to protect businesses and workers from the deep recession into which the global economy is sinking rapidly because of the coronavirus pandemic.
France has so far taken the boldest approach, promising that no company will be allowed to fail as a consequence of the disease that has prompted businesses large and small to suspend operations. The government will guarantee hundreds of billions worth of loans, delay tax payments and suspend rent and utility bills for smaller firms. And the French state is ready to go further, nationalizing industries if necessary.
The ironclad commitment to business, part of a response that Macron compared to being "at war," is the latest in a series of dramatic plans outlined by European governments as they race to confront an outbreak that is killing thousands of people and slamming global giants such as Renault (RNLSY) and Lufthansa (DLAKY), as well as shops, bars and restaurants.
Germany is mobilizing at least €500 billion ($550 billion) in loan guarantees and has pledged to provide unlimited liquidity to companies affected by the pandemic, part of a raft of measures that finance minister Olaf Scholz described last week as a "bazooka." The country will also make it easier for companies to access loans made by the state development bank and delay tax payments for struggling businesses.
The United Kingdom also joined the fight on Tuesday after being criticized over its delayed response to the crisis, having suggested only on Monday that people avoid gathering in large groups. UK finance minister Rishi Sunak announced that the government will back an initial £330 billion ($400 billion) in loans for companies. Mortgage providers have agreed to delay payments for three months for people affected by the coronavirus, he said.
"We believe that these measures will help the French economy to rebound more quickly after the deep recession caused by Covid-19 and reach the third quarter with a limited number of large bankruptcies and hence an unemployment rate far below what a recession of that magnitude could have caused," they said in a research note.
The global coronavirus recession is beginning
Coronavirus devastates China's economy and the 'nightmare' is not over
One laggard is the United States, which has yet to announce major stimulus measures despite having nearly 5,000 coronavirus cases. The Trump administration is proposing a rescue plan that will cost an estimated $850 billion, but there's no guarantee it will be approved by Congress.
House lawmakers have, meanwhile, approved a bill that would improve the social safety net for workers affected by coronavirus, but the paid sick and medical leave provisions would fall well short of what's in place in Europe even if the proposal overcomes resistance from Senate Republicans.
US airlines are running out of cash quickly and will likely need a bailout if they are to survive the crisis, but direct financial assistance for struggling companies could prove controversial in a country that bailed out its banks and carmakers are recently as the global financial crisis.

Here's everything you need to know about social distancing
(CNN)To stop the spread of coronavirus, health officials have instructed the public to practice social distancing -- staying home, avoiding crowds and refraining from touching one another.
Although living like that can be lonely, inconvenient and even frightening, it's for the greater good, says Danielle Ompad, an associate professor at New York University's School of Global Public Health.
To help you do that, we answered your biggest questions about social distancing:
Read more of CNN's coronavirus Q&A here.
Sure can! There's no evidence that the virus can live in food, so whatever you eat should be safe.
Are food deliveries safe during the coronavirus pandemic?
Still, it's a good idea to disinfect the takeout containers and wash your hands afterward, says Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent.
Ordering takeout also helps restaurants and delivery drivers who may be losing money during the pandemic.
Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center, suggests paying and tipping online and asking the delivery person to leave your food outside the door to avoid interaction.
If you need to use public transportation to get to work, carry disinfecting wipes to clean seats and poles, and wash your hands as soon as your commute is over.
Practice as much social distancing as your work allows. Wash your hands constantly, and if your occupation requires it, wear a face mask.
Yes, a few places -- grocery stores, doctor's offices and some outdoor areas. But right now, staying home as much as possible is the best way to lower infection rates, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Restaurants, places of worship, movie theaters, sports venues, museums and more have already started closing. Save a trip to these places until government and health officials say it's safe to visit.
Airplanes, trains, buses and cruise ships can pack a lot of people in close quarters for long periods of time, which is a recipe for virus transmission.
"If you're going for vacation, I would suggest you don't go," says Ompad, the NYU professor. "I definitely don't suggest you visit sick or elderly family. But some people don't have a choice -- they have to travel, work for airlines or trains or they're traveling because they're doing Covid-19 work or they can't afford to not do their jobs."
Health
Should I wear a face mask in public?
Probably not. Masks keep germs in by preventing sick people from coughing or sneezing into the air. But they don't protect healthy people from coming into contact with those germs.
Not unless you have an urgent appointment or are seeking help due to coronavirus symptoms.
If you do have a critical appointment, ask your provider about telehealth appointments that don't require you to come into an office.
If you think you're experiencing Covid-19 symptoms, call a physician before showing up at an office so you don't put yourself and others at a higher risk of infection.
You shouldn't. Adults over 60 are at a higher risk of serious infection from Covid-19, and you could unwittingly infect them. The best thing older adults can do is stay home and away from others as much as possible.
"Social distancing does not mean social isolation. It's really important we maintain our social connections," Ompad says.
No. Kids aren't considered a high-risk group for Covid-19, but they can still spread the virus.
Parents: Take social distancing seriously and limit playdates
"We know that kids touch each other and rough house with each other, and so we really want to be mindful about reducing that interpersonal contact and any potential spread," says Dr. Asaf Bitton of Ariadne Labs, a health innovation center.
If it's your only option, then yes. But before you do, call the daycare center or meet with staff to ensure they're implementing social distancing measures.
If you urgently need child care, ask a healthy family member to watch your child and maintain proper distancing measures. If you work with a regular babysitter or nanny, use caution. They should be keeping themselves healthy on their own, but may be putting themselves at risk while commuting to work.
Probably not, Ompad says, unless either of you are showing symptoms of sickness.
If my family member or roommate works in health care, do I need to distance myself from them?
Health care workers are at a higher risk of infection, so it's wise to distance yourself from them.
Emory University epidemiologist Rachel Patzer tweeted that her husband, a physician who treats Covid-19 patients, moved into the garage to avoid infecting their young children.
"It is difficult to see pictures of all the people at bars and restaurants, socializing, making play dates, and ignoring social distancing recommendations when I know my husband and many other healthcare workers are risking their lives to treat more sick patients," she wrote. 'Please, take this pandemic seriously."
How long will we have to keep social distancing?
Probably for several months. But we may have to do it over and over again, since the outbreak could come in waves.
Research by the Imperial College in Great Britain "would suggest you have to institute these kinds of measures for five months, very vigorously," says Gounder, the infectious disease specialist.
"And then you may be able to relax for a period. And then you would re-institute as the cases go up again. But we're basically looking at doing this over and over and over again, even after a five-month period of strict social distancing, in order to curb cases until we have a vaccine."

(CNN) — The aviation industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with travelers across the world dealing with canceled flights and travel bans as they scramble to get home.
This one off milestone was a direct consequence of the coronavirus-induced US travel restrictions.
"This flight was operated on an exceptional basis and within the constraints imposed by the American authorities in the face of the Covid-19 epidemic," an Air Tahiti Nui spokesperson told CNN Travel in a statement.
The flight, which was airborne for just under 16 hours, became the world's longest commercial flight in terms of distance traveled.

(CNN) — As new cases of novel coronavirus are growing, the travel industry is feeling the impact -- with vacationers and business people debating whether or not to cancel or postpone trips, and some countries, including the US, implementing travel restrictions.
But airplanes are still flying, and travelers still traveling, albeit with extra bottles of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes in carry-ons.
CNN Travel spoke to airlines, airplane companies and medical experts to find out what's been done to ensure you're flying in as hygienic an environment as possible, and what passengers can do for extra reassurance.
"A basic but more thorough cabin clean is usually carried out at night -- or when there is more downtime -- and it includes the cleaning of toilets, wiping down and disinfecting of trays, cleaning galleys, [overhead bins], seats etc. This may take up to an hour or longer," explains Rooney.
Cleaning products and disinfectants are approved by aircraft manufacturers, says Rooney.
"Some of the disinfectants we use are effective against a wide range of pathogens and are known to inactivate complex viruses with similar properties to SARS, E. coli, avian flu, MRSA etc," he adds.
Everything travelers need to know about novel coronavirus
"We have seen an uptick in the requirements and levels of disinfection, spraying and fumigation of the cabin, as the airlines look to address concerns over the coronavirus," he explains.
But Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in Vanderbilt University's division of infectious diseases, says that he doesn't think there's much more carriers can do to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
"Even if there is virus in the inanimate environment, it's not going to jump off the seat and bite you in the ankle. You've got to touch it, and then touch your nose or your mouth," Schaffner explains.
Dr Paulo Alves, who is currently attending IATA's Aviation Resilience Health workshop in Singapore -- which is working to address the overall impact of COVID-19 -- agrees with Schaffner.
"It seems reasonable to wipe the tray table surface, where it is more likely for droplets to land after someone coughs or sneezes. Travelers should maintain good personal hygiene on board flights, before flights and after flights and avoid touching their face."
What symptoms to be on the lookout for and how to protect yourself from coronavirus
"Our cleaning program includes the disinfecting of all hard surfaces within the cabin, as well as seat and carpet cleaning," he says. "Southwest will continue to monitor and follow all guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization regarding the coronavirus and make any adjustments to our procedures, as necessary."
Meanwhile, a Qantas spokesperson tells CNN Travel that the airline adopts "the highest standard in cleaning and disinfecting our cabins, seats, galleys and washrooms."
The spokesperson also highlights the HEPA filters which are part of the air conditioning system. "These filters are used in hospital operating theaters, with air in the cabin replaced every three to five minutes. This provides much cleaner air than other public spaces like trains, restaurants, shopping centers and offices."
This echoes the official advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that, due to the way air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, "most viruses and other germs do not spread easily," but that travelers are still advised to "avoid contact with sick passengers and wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol."
Delta says on its website that it's been deploying a "fogging technique" since February, using "a highly effective, EPA-registered disinfectant."
Fogging is being used on all trans-Pacific Delta flights arriving into the US, with plans to expand those procedures to more inbound international flights, focusing on flights coming from places with reported coronavirus cases. Fogging has been taking place on all inbound Delta flights from Italy to New York-JFK and Atlanta since February 29.
"Out of an abundance of caution, aircraft will be taken out of service to perform extensive additional deep cleaning and supplementary disinfection when a confirmed case of coronavirus has been identified," says a Cathay Pacific spokesperson.
"This includes the replacement of all seat covers, disinfection of all surfaces and galley equipment, detailed cleaning of the lavatories, disinfection of carpets, sterilization of the water system and replacement of air filters in addition to standard cleaning procedures."
Alves agrees, pointing out that viruses will be eliminated when blankets and pillows are washed. However, he does clarify that there are "knowledge gaps" about the COVID-19 virus and research is ongoing, so recommendations may change.
Travelers will face new restrictions and cancellations as coronavirus cases grow in the US
"Perhaps the most important point to keep in mind is that not a single case of COVID-19 has yet been attributed to on-board transmission," he says.

Here's how the novel coronavirus outbreak unfolded
(CNN) — As coronavirus spreads across the globe, the vacation rental company Airbnb expanded its extenuating circumstances policy yesterday, allowing almost all travelers to cancel their reservations penalty-free.
The company can override those conditions with its Extenuating Circumstances Policy, and that's how many Covid-19-related cancellations may qualify for refunds.
A wedding in flux, a dream trip postponed, and so much confusion
As President Trump's Schengen Area travel ban goes into effect, and confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the United States rise, Airbnb has made the area covered by the extenuating circumstances policy global.
Not every travel company is offering exceptions for coronavirus cancellations. The vacation rental property Vrbo has not offered any Covid-19-related exceptions to its cancellation policy.
Addressing homeowners in a letter on March 12th, Hurst suggested that they remain open to such requests. "In the spirit of good hospitality," he wrote, "we strongly encourage you to offer a full refund."
In some cases, the 50% deposits paid by guests to Airbnb (which holds deposits until 24 hours after check-in) might be hundreds or even thousands of dollars, money that hosts won't ever get when travelers cancel their bookings — whether or not they're in an area already severely impacted by coronavirus. (The CDC's Global Outbreak Notice notes that sustained community spread of coronavirus is occurring globally.)

Everyone in Northern Ireland should now be social distancing
COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. It's caused by a type of virus called coronavirus.
Everyone should do what they can to stop coronavirus spreading.
Social distancing will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus by reducing the social interaction between people.
avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus - these symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough;
work from home, where possible - your employer should support you to do this.
Everyone should be trying to follow these measures as much as possible. This will mean our usual social activities are on hold for the moment. It’s very important that we look after our mental and emotional wellbeing. Based on the Take 5 steps to wellbeing, this leaflet offers tips on supporting your mental and emotional wellbeing while staying at home during the current coronavirus outbreak.
have an underlying health condition;
For more information see COVID-19: guidance on social distancing and for vulnerable people 
Like seasonal flu, the same public health advice applies for COVID-19 (Coronavirus): if you cough or sneeze, use a tissue to cover your mouth and nose, throw it away carefully after use, and wash your hands.
The best way to prevent the spread of infections, including coronavirus, is good personal hygiene. This means washing your hands regularly using soap and water and drying them with paper towels.
COVID-19 is caused by a virus. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. Antibiotics should not be used to try to prevent or treat COVID-19 (coronavirus). They will not work and may cause harm.
What should I do if I think I have coronavirus?
Do not go to your GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
if you have symptoms of coronavirus, you'll need to stay at home for 7 days;
if you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll need to stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person in the home started having symptoms;
however, if you develop symptoms during this 14-day period, you’ll need to stay at home for 7 days from the day your symptoms started (regardless of what day you are on in the original 14-day period). This may mean you have to stay at home for a maximum of 21 days;
if you have symptoms and live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else they can stay with for the 14-day isolation period;
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community;
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you are well enough to stay at home.
If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible. Guidance on this can be found on the Public Health England website:
www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection
an existing health condition;
problems with your immune system;
very serious symptoms.
Do not attend your GP surgery or emergency department in person before calling ahead and speaking with someone.
If it is a medical emergency and you need to call an ambulance, dial 999 and inform the operator of your symptoms.
For more information see COVID-19: guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection
Testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers.
We would advise caution about obtaining testing from non-governmental sources. A positive or negative test will not be recognised by the NHS and will not change the advice given.  You will still have to observe recommended isolation periods.
If you work in healthcare: You should contact your Trust line manager and occupational health. Your employer will give specific advice about diagnostic testing and when you can return to work.
The Public Health Agency (PHA) does not issue travel advice. If you’re concerned about the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on your existing travel plans, check with your airline, tour operator, cruise line or other transport and accommodation providers as applicable. People who plan to travel should check the travel advice here.

The Public Health Agency Health Protection surveillance team has established surveillance systems which are used to monitor COVID-19 activity in Northern Ireland. The systems allow us to monitor trends, inform public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission, and to measure the impact of public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission in both hospital and community settings. 
As of 9.16am on Saturday 28 March, testing has resulted in 49 new positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Northern Ireland to 324.

Hoboken has become the first city in the US to implement a widespread curfew due to coronavirus fears, and will limit restaurants to takeout and delivery
Hoboken, New Jersey, will implement a 10 p.m. curfew and restrict restaurants to takeout and delivery only amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Starting March 14, residents must remain in their homes unless there's an emergency or they're required to work at night, according to Mayor Ravinder Bhalla.
The New Jersey city of Hoboken has become the first in the United States to implement a curfew amid the coronavirus outbreak sweeping the country.
Mayor Ravinder Bhalla announced the measure Saturday evening, and said the Office of Emergency Management will enforce a daily curfew from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m., where residents must remain in their homes unless there's an emergency or they're required to work at night.
As I've mentioned, these are challenging times & we're seeing substantial uptick of COVID-19 cases throughout NJ & the world. The time is now to enact proactive policies that will save lives. We've asked families w/ children to help by closing schools. We must now do our part.
At least one person required emergency services, but police had to wait more than 30 minutes "because our EMS is inundated with service calls," Bhalla said.
"This is unfortunately a contributing factor why we cannot continue bar operations which can trigger calls for service that are delayed in part because of this public health crisis.
Earlier on Saturday, Bhalla announced that all gyms, health clubs, day cares, and movie theaters would also be shuttered.
The actions mimic certain coronavirus measures implemented in countries such as Italy, France, and Spain.

WHO Director-General calls on G20 to Fight, Unite, and Ignite against COVID-19
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, addressed Heads of State at today’s extraordinary G20 Leaders’ Summit focused on COVID-19. 
He told them, “You have come together to confront the defining health crisis of our time: We are at war with a virus that threatens to tear us apart - if we let it.“
He welcomed the G20‘s initiative to find joint solutions and work together: “This is a global crisis that requires a global response.”
Third, he exhorted them to ignite a global movement to ensure this never happens again. 
He welcomed G20 leaders‘ commitment “to do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic” to protect lives and livelihoods, as well as restore confidence and shore up stability currently threatened in trade and other sectors, and to commit to take all necessary health measures and seek to ensure adequate financing to contain the pandemic and protect people, especially the most vulnerable.“
G20 members pledged to work together to increase research and development funding for vaccines and medicines, strengthen international scientific cooperation, and leverage digital technologies.
In turn, they tasked WHO and other relevant organizations with assessing gaps in pandemic preparedness and report the findings of this assessment to the G20 Finance and Health Ministers, in order to establish a global initiative on pandemic preparedness and response together.

WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 11 March 2020
WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 11 March 2020
In the past two weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China has increased 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has tripled.  
Thousands more are fighting for their lives in hospitals.
In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries climb even higher.
WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. 
Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.
Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this virus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do.
We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. This is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus.
And we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled, at the same time.  
Of the 118,000 cases reported globally in 114 countries, more than 90 percent of cases are in just four countries, and two of those – China and the Republic of Korea - have significantly declining epidemics. 
We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
Even those countries with community transmission or large clusters can turn the tide on this virus. 
Several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled. 
We are grateful for the measures being taken in Iran, Italy and the Republic of Korea to slow the virus and control their epidemics.
All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.
WHO’s mandate is public health. But we’re working with many partners across all sectors to mitigate the social and economic consequences of this pandemic.
This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector – so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight. 
I remind all countries that we are calling on you to activate and scale up your emergency response mechanisms;
Ready your hospitals;
Protect and train your health workers. 
Public health.

COVID-19: Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response
In order to assist UN country teams in scaling up country preparedness and response to COVID-19, WHO has developed these learning modules as a companion to the Operational Planning Guidelines to Support Country Preparedness and Response.
To support national readiness and preparedness for COVID-19
To help countries increase their capacity to respond to COVID-19
Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) for novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
This course provides information on what facilities should be doing to be prepared to respond to a case of an emerging respiratory virus such as the novel coronavirus, how to identify a case once it occurs, and how to properly implement IPC measures to ensure there is no further transmission to HCW or to other patients and others in the healthcare facility.
This training is intended for healthcare workers and public health professionals, as it is focused on infection prevention and control.
Introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronavirus
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. This is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.
This course provides a general introduction to COVID-19 and emerging respiratory viruses and is intended for public health professionals, incident managers and personnel working for the United Nations, international organizations and NGOs.
It is intended for clinicians who are working in intensive care units (ICUs) in low and middle-income countries and managing adult and pediatric patients with severe forms of acute respiratory infection (SARI), including severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock. It is a hands-on practical guide to be used by health care professionals involved in clinical care management during outbreaks of influenza virus (seasonal) human infection due avian influenza virus (H5N1, H7N9), MERS-CoV, COVID-19 or other emerging respiratory viral epidemics.

Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Action Plan Guidance COVID-19 Preparedness and Response
This tool is designed to support risk communication, community engagement staff and responders working with national health authorities, and other partners to develop, implement and monitor an effective action plan for communicating effectively with the public, engaging with communities, local partners and other stakeholders to help prepare and protect individuals, families and the public’s health during early response to COVID-19.
Mental Health Considerations during COVID-19 Outbreak
These mental health considerations were developed by the Mental Health Department as support for mental and psychological well-being during COVID-19 outbreak.
Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) readiness and response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
This document provides WHO checklists for risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) readiness and initial response for novel coronaviruses (nCoV) recently identified in Wuhan, China. The objective of this document is to provide actionable guidance for countries to implement effective RCCE strategies which will help protect the public’s health in the early response to nCoV. This document includes recommended RCCE goals and actions for countries preparing for nCoV cases and for countries that have confirmed nCoV cases.
The COVID-19 risk communication package for healthcare facilities
In response to the COVID-19 outbreak this risk communication package for healthcare facilities provides healthcare workers (HCWs) and healthcare facility management with the information, procedures, and tools required to safely and effectively work. The package contains a series of simplified messages and reminders based on WHO's more in-depth technical guidance on infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities in the context of COVID-19: "Infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected" (25 January 2020). HCWs play a critical role in outbreak response and are the backbone of a country's defenses to limit or contain the spread of disease. They face higher risks of potential COVID-19 infection in their efforts to protect the greater community and are exposed to hazards such as psychological distress, fatigue and stigma. WHO recognizes this essential work and the responsibility and importance of protecting the healthcare facility workforce.
Getting your workplace ready for COVID-19
WHO and public health authorities around the world are taking action to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. However, long term success cannot be taken for granted. All sections of our society – including businesses and employers – must play a role if we are to stop the spread of this disease.
A guide to preventing and addressing social stigma associated with COVID-19
Social stigma in the context of health is the negative association between a person or group of people who share certain characteristics and a specific disease. In an outbreak, this may mean people are labelled, stereotyped, discriminated against, treated separately, and/or experience loss of status because of a perceived link with a disease. 
The current COVID-19 outbreak has provoked social stigma and discriminatory behaviours against people of certain ethnic backgrounds as well as anyone perceived to have been in contact with the virus.

Naming the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus that causes it
Official names have been announced for the virus responsible for COVID-19 (previously known as “2019 novel coronavirus”) and the disease it causes.  The official names are:
Disease 
coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19)
Virus 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2)
 Why do the virus and the disease have different names? 
Viruses, and the diseases they cause, often have different names.  For example, HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  People often know the name of a disease, such as measles, but not the name of the virus that causes it (rubeola).
There are different processes, and purposes, for naming viruses and diseases.
Viruses are named based on their genetic structure to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. Virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses are named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).  
Diseases are named to enable discussion on disease prevention, spread, transmissibility, severity and treatment. Human disease preparedness and response is WHO’s role, so diseases are officially named by WHO in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
ICTV announced “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” as the name of the new virus on 11 February 2020.  This name was chosen because the virus is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003.  While related, the two viruses are different.   
WHO announced “COVID-19” as the name of this new disease on 11 February 2020, following guidelines previously developed with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
WHO and ICTV were in communication about the naming of both the virus and the disease.
 What name does WHO use for the virus?
From a risk communications perspective, using the name SARS can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003. 
For that reason and others, WHO has begun referring to the virus as “the virus responsible for COVID-19” or “the COVID-19 virus” when communicating with the public.  Neither of these designations are intended as replacements for the official name of the virus as agreed by the ICTV.
Material published before the virus was officially named will not be updated unless necessary in order to avoid confusion.
How are new infectious diseases named?

Infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected
This is the first edition of guidance on infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies for use when infection with a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is suspected. It has been adapted from WHO’s Infection prevention and control during health care for probable or confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, based on current knowledge of the situation in China and other countries where cases were identified and experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Infection Prevention and Control for the safe management of a dead body in the context of COVID-19
This interim guidance is for all those, including managers of health care facilities and mortuaries, religious and public health authorities, and families, who tend to the bodies of persons who have died of suspected or confirmed COVID-19. 
IPC guidance for long-term care facilities in the context of COVID-19
The objective of this interim guidance is to provide guidance on Infection Prevention and Control in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCF) in the context of COVID-19 to prevent COVID-19-virus from entering the facility, spreading within the facility, and spreading to outside the facility. This guidance is for LTCF managers and corresponding IPC focal persons in LTCF. 
  Consideration for quarantine of individuals in the context of containment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
The purpose of this document is to offer guidance to Member States on quarantine measures for individuals in the context of COVID-19. It is intended for those responsible for establishing local or national policy for quarantine of individuals, and adherence to infection prevention and control measures. 
Health workers exposure risk assessment and management in the context of COVID-19 virus
This tool is to be used by health care facilities that have either cared for or admitted COVID-19 patients; it is to be completed for all health workers who have been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient in a health care facility. It will help determine the risk of COVID-19 virus infection of all HCWs who have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient and then provides recommendations for appropriate management of these HCWs, according to their infection risk.
Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
This document summarizes WHO recommendations for the rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE), in health care and community settings, including the handling of cargo. This document is intended for those involved in the distribution and management of PPE, as well as public health authorities and individuals in health care and community settings to understand when PPE use is most appropriate.
This document provides rapid advice on the use of medical masks in communities, at home and at health care facilities in areas that have reported outbreaks caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV). It is intended for public health and infection prevention and control (IPC) professionals, health care managers, health care workers and community health workers.
Home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection presenting with mild symptoms and management of contacts
WHO has developed this rapid advice note to meet the need for recommendations on the safe home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection presenting with mild symptoms and public health measures related to management of asymptomatic contacts.
Q&A on infection prevention and control for health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV
Are boots, impermeable aprons, or coverall suits required as routine person protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers (HCW) caring for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection? Can disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused? Do patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV need to be hospitalized if they have mild illness? Here you will find answers to these and other questions related to infection prevention and control for health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.
Water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management for COVID-19
This Technical Brief supplements existing IPC documents by referring to and summarizing WHO guidance on water, sanitation and health care waste which is relevant for viruses (including coronaviruses). This Technical Brief is written in particular for water and sanitation practitioners and providers.
Part B contains important safety and cost information and incorporates information from the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care (2009).

 These materials are regularly updated based on new scientific findings as the epidemic evolves. Last updated 18 March 2020
  Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus
Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Most people who become infected experience mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for others. Take care of your health and protect others by doing the following:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain social distancing
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider
Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.
  Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading
Stay at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache and slight runny nose, until you recover. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers. Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.

Symptoms
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.

From 10 February 2020 onwards, the data includes the cases in Hubei that were not tested for the virus but clinically diagnosed based on medical imaging showing signs of pneumonia.[4]
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was first manifested by a cluster of mysterious, suspected pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to Huanan Seafood Market after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the National Health Commission (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia.[7] The sequence of the virus was soon published on an open-access database.[8] Measures taken by China were praised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and some foreign governments.[9][10][11] China's response has been more transparent than how the country responded to SARS in 2003.[10][12]
However, delayed and controversial responses by the Wuhan and Hubei authorities failed to contain the outbreak in the early stage which led to criticism from the public and the media.[13] By 29 January, the virus spread to all provinces of mainland China.[14][15][16] By 8 February, over 724 died from the coronavirus infection-associated pneumonia and 34,878 were confirmed to have been infected. In Hubei alone, there were 24,953 cases of infections and 699 related deaths.[17] All provinces of mainland China initiated the highest response level to public health emergency.[18] WHO declared the outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern" on 31 January[16] for fear that the virus spread beyond China to where there is no robust healthcare system despite its confidence that China was "doing all that it can".[19]
Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping warned about a "grave situation" facing China.[20][21] The Party Politburo formed a special leading group for epidemic control, led by Premier Li Keqiang. The Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled. Passengers across the country have been checked for their temperatures.[22] Commands for epidemic control (CEC) have been formed in different regions including Wuhan and Hubei. Many inter-province bus services[23] and railway services have been suspended.[24] By 29 January, all Hubei cities were quarantined.[25] Curfew laws were implemented in Huanggang, Wenzhou,[26] and other mainland cities.[27] The region also sees a huge shortage of face masks and other protective gear despite itself being the world's manufacturing hub for these products.[28]
On 25 February, the number of newly confirmed cases outside mainland China exceeded those from within for the first time; the WHO praised the effectiveness of measures taken in the country.[29] By 6 March the reported number of new cases had dropped to well fewer than 100 nationally per day, down from thousands per day at the height of the crisis. On 13 March, the number of newly imported cases passed the number of domestically transmitted new cases for the first time.[30]
With the increasing reported cases of infections, fear upgraded along with regional discrimination in China and racial discrimination beyond China despite calls for stopping the discrimination by many governments.[31][32] Some rumors circulated across Chinese social media, along with endorsements and counter-rumor efforts by media and governments.[33][34] The government has worked to censor and counter reporting and criticism about the crisis, and to portray the official response to the outbreak in a positive light.[35][36]
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that spread of domestically transmitted epidemic has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.[37]

New infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts.[38] Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold,[39][40] a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 and killed 774 of them.[40] The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population.[40][41][42] Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans.[40]
Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in China have been worried about the potential return of the deadly virus which motivated the Chinese government to reform its public health system in order to handle the next public health crisis.[43][44][45] As part of the reform, China expanded the laboratory networks to handle the pathogens of the infectious diseases which included a newly-built BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan and a national key laboratory to investigate into pneumonia with unclear causes.[46] Zeng Guang, the Chief Scientist at China CDC believed that a quicker publication of the epidemic information was a lesson that China learned from the SARS outbreak as the lack of information release worsened the outbreak.[46]
With the improved public health system, China managed to handle several public health emergencies. In coping with the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak starting from Mexico, China developed and distributed vaccines to 100 million people within months as an active prevention.[45] During the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in East China, the country's health system identified the pathogen 5 days after the outbreak. Test kits for diagnosis were designed and distributed to all mainland provinces 3 days after the identification. Within months, effective vaccines were developed. Besides, Chinese academic Li Lanjuan and her group was the first to reveal the virus's transmission methods, molecular mechanisms and effective treatment.[47]
However, as Southern Metropolis Daily pointed out, although people paid more attention to public health, the government's funding to the health system was far from enough as CDCs in smaller municipalities had to reduce their staff. 10 years after the SARS outbreak, few people wore a face mask when they had respiratory symptoms and the hospitals were cutting the fever clinics off.[48] Despite confidence in winning the next battle against SARS, Zhong Nanshan who earned fame in fighting the SARS outbreak in 2003 still held a conservative attitude to whether the Chinese officials would lie to the people about a disease outbreak.[45]
Animated Map of 2019-nCoV Confirmed Cases in PRC-claimed territories
Early cases surrounding the animal market suggested potential animal-to-human transmission while later the virus is found to be able to transmit from ill people to others.[49] There have been cases where asymptomatic patients transmitted the virus to others.[50][51] According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact[52] while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from.[53][54] The typical symptoms of the viral infection included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia[55] which are usually developed after an incubation time lasting as long as 2 weeks.[56] However, the existence of mild but infectious cases complicated the epidemic control efforts.[57] It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period.[58] It should be kept in mind that the Covid-19 rapid test manufactured in Peoples Republic of China only had sensitivity of 30% [59], which could explain the low number of infected and asymptomatic cases.
Mysterious pneumonia outbreak
One of the earliest Wuhan MHC notices about the pneumonia epidemic. It was first posted on Weibo on 30 December 2019 and was confirmed by Wuhan CDC the next day (31 December).
The first confirmed patient started experiencing symptoms on 1 December 2019,[60] though the South China Morning Post later reported that the first case may have been a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province as early as 17 November.[61][62][63] More recently, on 27 March 2020, news outlets citing a government document reported that a 57-year-old woman, who tested positive for the coronavirus disease on 10 December 2019 and was described in The Wall Street Journal on 6 March 2020, may have been patient zero in the coronavirus pandemic.[64][65] Although the first confirmed patient did not have any exposure to Huanan Seafood Market, an outbreak of the virus began among the people who had been exposed to the market nine days later.[66][67] On 26 December, Shanghai PHC received a sample of a patient with unknown pneumonia from Wuhan CDC and Wuhan Central Hospital and started an investigation to the sample which was later confirmed to contain a new coronavirus.[66]
However, the outbreak went unnoticed until a cluster of unknown pneumonia was observed by a Wuhan doctor named Zhang Jixian.[68] Zhang is the director of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hubei Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine.[69] Her experience fighting SARS in 2003 kept her alerted about a public health emergency. On 26 December 2019, a senior couple who lived near Zhang's hospital came to her for their fever and cough. The CT scan results of the couple's thorax showed unusual changes in the lungs which were different from those in any known viral pneumonia. Dr. Zhang advised the couple's son to see her and found similar conditions. On the same day, a patient from Huanan Seafood Market that Dr. Zhang saw also had the unusual conditions.[70]
On 27 December, the doctor reported her discovery to her hospital and the hospital soon informed Jianghan CDC, thinking that this might be an infectious disease as it was indicated by the familial cluster. As a precaution, she told her colleagues to wear protective gear and prepare a specialized area in the hospital to receive patients with similar conditions.[70]
On 28 and 29 December, three more patients that had visited the Huanan Seafood Market came to the clinic of the hospital. The hospital notified the provincial and municipal health commissions. The health commissions appointed Wuhan and Jianghan CDC and Jinyintan Hospital to undertake epidemiological research for the seven patients on 29 December. Six of them are transferred to Jinyintan, a specialized facility for infectious diseases. Only one patient refused the transfer.[68][70] Dr. Zhang Jixian's discovery was widely praised;[71] the Hubei government honored her and Zhang Dingyu, the president of Jinyintan, for their contribution to controlling the viral outbreak.[69]
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital, led by Dr. Ai Fen, launched an alert on a "SARS-like coronavirus". Eight of these doctors were arrested on charges of spreading false rumors, including doctor Li Wenliang. In an interview with Renwu magazine, Ai Fen said she was reprimanded after alerting her superiors and colleagues of a Sars-like virus seen in patients in December.
On the evening of 30 December, the two emergent notice letters from the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan began to circulate on the Internet which was soon confirmed by Wuhan CDC who admitted that there were 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December. The letters required all hospitals in Wuhan to report any pneumonia patient with unknown causes and related to Huanan Seafood Market. They also asked the hospitals to give proper treatment to these patients. Wuhan CDC told The Beijing News that the investigation was still underway and the experts from NHC were on the way to help the investigation[72] after a rumor about it circulated on the Internet.[66]
On 1 January 2020, the seafood market was closed down by Jianghan District's Health Agency and Administration for Market Regulation due to an "environment improvement." According to China Business, the workers in hazmat suits were inspecting all around the market and collecting samples. The storekeepers at the market said that they were not told what the people were collecting and detecting. The urban management officers and police officers were on the spot to ask the storekeepers to finish up and leave the market.[73]
Several doctors were warned by Wuhan's police for "spreading misinformation" and eight "rumormongers" who were all doctors at Wuhan hospitals according to Wang Gaofei, Weibo's CEO[74] were summoned by the police on 3 January.[75][76] Li Wenliang, one of the whistleblowers died from the virus on 7 February[77] which was the same day when the discoverers of the outbreak, Zhang Jixian and Zhang Dingyu, were honored by Hubei's government.[78] The death of Dr. Li led to widespread grief and criticism toward the government.[79]
Number of cases (blue) and number of deaths (red) on a logarithmic scale.
Although the early cases surrounding an animal market may suggest animal-to-human transmission, more evidence surfaced to support the human-to-human transmission of the virus.[49] However, despite the expert-led investigation and early signs of human-to-human transmission including a hospital-acquired infection (nosocomial) case confirmed on 10 January according to Caixin,[80] the local government of Wuhan denied any case of nosocomial infection and kept claiming that "there was no clear sign of human-to-human transmission" until 15 January when Wuhan's Municipal Health Commission (MHC) said on its website that "the result of present investigation shows no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, but this does not rule out the possibility of such a transmission. The risk of continuous human-to-human transmission is low."[81]
The reported case number froze at 41 during the Hubei Lianghui and Wuhan Lianghui, the local parliament sessions between 6–17 January, which the local authorities of Hubei and Wuhan claimed to be due to the lack of PCR test kits for the new virus. But, Caixin said that the other sequencing techniques can be used for diagnosis which usually takes two days without any need of PCR kits.[82] Meanwhile, an Imperial College group[83][84] and a Hong Kong University group[85] both estimated over 1,000 cases in Wuhan as cases were being exported and confirmed overseas. Perceived discrepancies in the official Chinese data for the number of cases left many netizens doubtful,[86] with some mockingly labeling the virus "patriotic" for its appearance of mainly infecting the Chinese after they left the country.[87][88][89]
On 20 January, the number of reported new cases soared to 136 as major mainland cities including Beijing and Shenzhen reported their first cases.[90][91] Only the Wuhan authorities stopped claiming that the virus had a limited ability to transmit between humans.[92] On the same day, the city formed a specialized command for epidemic control (CEC) to upgrade measures to cope with the epidemic including enhanced protection over the medical workers[93] and free treatment for all patients at the fever clinics.[94] On the evening of that day, Zhong Nanshan, one of the NHC experts sent to Wuhan who was well known for fighting against SARS in 2003, exemplified human-to-human transmission of the new virus with a cluster of 14 hospital-acquired infections in Wuhan and two familial clusters in Guangdong.[95]
However, the National Health Commission still insisted that the epidemic should be "manageable and preventable." At that time, the BBC said that not much public attention was drawn to the virus outbreak.[80] On 19 January, despite the virus outbreak, over 40,000 Wuhan families joined an annual potluck banquet[96] which was a community tradition observed for over two decades to celebrate the Kitchen God Festival. A community leader told The Beijing News that "everything is normal now" when asked about the virus outbreak.[97] According to the community committee of Baibuting where the banquet was held as of 4 February, a block of the community had at least 10 confirmed cases of the coronavirus infection, plus over 30 highly suspicious cases, but the community hospital also said that the incidents of the coronavirus was lower than that in the other communities.[98]
Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan who was widely criticized by the public and media due to slow responses[99] said to the state media CCTV that the banquet was organized by the local community which had a long history of self-governance. He said that the government was not precautious enough to stop it because it was believed that the virus only had a limited ability to transmit between the people.[100]
On 20 January, Guan Yi, an expert in SARS epidemiology told Caixin that the local government should not play on words about transmissibility and he hoped that we could learn from the 2003 SARS outbreak. He continued, "transmissibility, adaptability, incidence and virulence of the virus highly resemble those of SARS at the early stage [of the 2003 outbreak]".[101] Guan's team came to Wuhan on 21 January and returned to Hong Kong on the next day. He said to the media that the "epidemiology experts and scientists do not seem to be welcomed in the city."[102] On 22 January, Wuhan was still "an open city" to the virus outbreak where most people did not wear a mask although NHC announced the coronavirus-associated pneumonia as a notifiable disease. He believed that a pandemic was unavoidable as the virus spread with the migration flow of Chunyun.[103][104]
The statements of Guan which were apparently different from that in most Chinese media became highly controversial as the journalists of state media reposted his statement on 15 January where he said that he believed that the disease was manageable and the news that his lab was fined by the Chinese authorities in 2005. Wang Duan, the Caixin journalist who made the interview described such behavior as "personal attacks" and complained that no expert came forward to refute what Guan said so far.[105]

Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping warned that China was facing a 'grave situation'.[20][21] He held a Party Politburo meeting which promised resources and experts for treatment and supplies to Hubei[106] as more and more cases of the viral infection, mostly exported from Wuhan were confirmed in other cities in Hubei[14] and multiple parts in mainland China.[107] On 29 January, Tibet announced its first confirmed case, a male who traveled from Wuhan to Lhasa by rail on 22–24 January[108] which marked that the virus spread to all parts of mainland China.[14][15][16]
At the end of December 2019, Henan Province announced the suspension of passenger trains to and from Wuhan. In early January 2020, the local government of Henan Province with its complete disinfection measures, effective and intensive publicity, a strong awareness of epidemic prevention and quarantine among the people, the setting up of return spots at the village entrance and even the use of garbage trucks, the digging of trenches to block roads connecting Hubei and the hanging of slogans such as "return home with sickness is to dishonor your parents." #抄河南的作业 (literally: 'copy Henan's homework') became a trending Weibo topic hashtag.[110][111][112]
However, cutting the roads off without authorization is illegal in mainland China as Xinhua and the Public Security Ministry pointed out.[113][114] The Ministry of Transport asked the local governments to take the principle of "block one, not three (Chinese: 一断三不断)", that is, to block the virus from spreading, but not to block roads, traffic and Internet access, the transportation of emergency supplies and the transportation of essential goods.[115]

By 21 January, government officials warned against hiding the disease.[116]
On 22 January, Hubei launched a Class 2 Response to Public Health Emergency.[117] Ahead of the Hubei authorities, a Class 1 Response to Public Health Emergency, the highest response level was announced by the mainland province of Zhejiang on 23.[118][119] Guangdong and Hunan followed suit later on the day. On the following day, Hubei[107] and other 13 mainland provinces[120][121][122][123] also launched a Class 1 Response. By 29, all parts of mainland initiated a Class 1 Response after Tibet upgraded its response level on that day.[18]
The highest response level authorizes a provincial government to requisition resources under the administration in order to control the epidemic. The government was allowed to organize and coordinate treatment for the patients, make investigations into the epidemic area, declare certain areas in the province as an epidemic control area, issue compulsory orders, manage human movement, publish information and reports, sustain social stability and to do other work related to epidemic control.[124]
As for the other major sports events, 2019–20 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup, scheduled for 15–16 February 2020 was canceled due to the outbreak. The event was originally planned to be the 2022 Winter Olympics' first test. The 2020 World Athletics Indoor Championships, originally scheduled to take place in Nanjing from 13 to 15 March are postponed for a year and will be held at the same venue.[138] The Confederations Cup Asia Pacific Group I, scheduled to be held in Dongguan, Guangdong was moved to Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan.[139]
Patronage was significantly reduced at May 4th Square Station of Qingdao Metro Line 3 during the epidemic.

On 21 January 2020, the Ministry of Education (MoE) requested the education system to do a good job in the prevention and control of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection. After that, private education providers including New Oriental, NewChannel and TAL Education,[159] education departments in Hubei,[160] Zhejiang,[161] Shenzhen,[162] and Shanghai University[163] cancelled all ongoing courses and postponed the new semester. On 27th, MoE advised all higher education institutions to postpone the new spring semester with all local education departments to determine the starting time of the new semester for K-12 education and local colleges according to the decision of the local governments.[164] The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security also decided to put the new semester off for all vocational education facilities.[165]
The National Education Examinations Authority canceled all IELTS, TOEFL and GRE exams scheduled for February. The decision was first made for tests to be held in Wuhan and extended to those in all parts of mainland China.[166][167][168] MoE also urged the Chinese students studying abroad to delay their travels. For those who need to go abroad, MoE advised them to arrive earlier in case of any kind of health check and to stop traveling if they have any signs of coughing and fever.[169]
Civil Affairs authorities in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Jinan, Ningbo and Gansu announced on 25 January that they would cancel the special arrangement of marriage registration scheduled for 2 February 2020 to avoid the spread of the epidemic and cross-infection caused by the gathering of people.[171][172][173][174] Later, on 30 January, the Ministry of Civil Affairs ordered to cancel marriage registrations on 2 February.[175]
The outbreak made an impact on the National People's Congress (NPC), China's national parliament and many local parliaments. On 27 January, the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee (PPCSC) of Yunnan announced to postpone local Lianghui sessions scheduled for early February which was followed by the PPCSC of Sichuan on 28 January. The local parliament sessions of cities including Hohhot, Chengdu, Jinan, Qingdao, Binzhou, Zhengzhou, Pingdingshan, Anyang, Hefei, Changzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Zhoushan, Ganzhou, Shangluo, and Jiangjin were also put off.[176]
The NPC's Standing Committee will discuss on 24 February to decide whether to delay its March session or not.[177] The 10-day session in March is an annual gathering of about 3,000 delegates from all parts of China where the major laws are passed and key economic targets are unveiled. The potential delay will be the first time since 1995 when the NPC first adopted the schedule for the March session.[178] Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong believed that the sessions may not only increase the risk of infections but also "post hostile and embarrassing questions to the top officials about the outbreak." He also believed that canceling the meetings would be possible although this never happened after the Cultural Revolution.[179]
The predictions varied on how deep or long-lasting that the economic impact will be. The problem is not so much sick people, but well people who are seriously inconvenienced by anti-epidemic measures, especially disrupting travel. Millions of workers are stranded far from their jobs while the workplaces were short-handed. The data for February 2020—the first full month after the virus became a major factor in January—saw official indicators of economic activity fell to record lows. The manufacturing index fell to 35.7 in February from 50 in January, showing a deep contraction. The nation's non-manufacturing index sank even further to a record low of 29.6 in February from 54.1 in January 2020. According to the Wall Street Journal, "The factory index indicated contraction for most of 2019, hit by a trade war between the U.S. and China. It didn’t cross back into expansion until late last year when trade tensions between the two sides eased."[180]
China's economic growth is expected to slow by up to 1.1 percentage in the first half of 2020 as economic activity is negatively affected by the new coronavirus outbreak, according to a Morgan Stanley study cited by Reuters.[181] But, on 1 February 2020, the People's Bank of China said that the impact of the epidemic on China's economy was temporary and the fundamentals of China's long-term positive and high-quality growth remained unchanged.[182]
Due to the outbreak, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced that with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Spring Festival holiday was extended to 2 February and trading will resume on 3 February.[183][184] Before that, on 23 January, the last trading day of shares before the Spring Festival, all three major stock indexes opened lower, creating a drop of about 3% and the Shanghai index fell below 3000.[185] On 2 February, the first trading day after the holiday, the three major indexes even set a record low opening of about 8%.[186] By the end of the day, the decline narrowed to about 7%, the Shenzhen index fell below 10,000 points, and a total of 3,177 stocks in the two markets fell.[187]
The sale of new cars in China was affected by the outbreak. There was a 92% reduction on the volume of cars sold during the first two weeks of February 2020.[192] According to the sources of Automative News, Chinese policymakers had discussed the extension of subsidies for electric-vehicle purchases beyond this year to revive sales.[192]
Face mask shortage
A notice at a supermarket in Beijing, which says each person can only buy a pack of surgical masks and a bottle of 84 disinfectant liquid a day.
As the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market saw a shortage of face masks due to the increased need from the public.[193] It was reported that Shanghai customers had to queue for nearly an hour to buy a pack of face masks which was sold out in another half an hour.[194] Some stores are hoarding, driving the prices up and other acts so the market regulator said that it will crack down on such acts.[195][196] The shortage will not be relieved until late February when most workers return from the New Year vacation according to Lei Limin, an expert in the industry.[197][needs update]
On 22 January 2020, Taobao, China's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group said that all face masks on Taobao and Tmall would not be allowed to increase in price. The special subsidies would be provided to the retailers. Also, Alibaba Health's "urgent drug delivery" service would not be closed during the Spring Festival.[198] JD, another leading Chinese e-commerce platform said, "We are actively working to ensure supply and price stability from sources, storage and distribution, platform control and so on" and "while fully ensuring price stability for JD's own commodities, JD.com also exercised strict control over the commodities on JD's platform. Third-party vendors selling face masks are prohibited from raising prices. Once it is confirmed that the prices of third-party vendors have increased abnormally, JD will immediately remove the offending commodities from shelves and deal with the offending vendors accordingly."[199] The other major e-commerce platforms including Sunning.com and Pinduoduo also promised to keep the prices of health products stable.[200][201]
Lockdown and curfew
See also: 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic § Outdoor restrictions
Ever since Hubei's lockdown, areas bordering Hubei including Yueyang, Hunan and Xinyang, Henan setted checkpoints up at roads connecting to Hubei to urge cars and people from Hubei.[202][203] Between 24–25 January, the local governments of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hainan and other areas announced to quarantine passengers from "key areas" of Hubei for 14 days.[204][205] Chongqing also announced to screen every person who arrived from Wuhan since 1 January and setted 3 centers for treatment up.[206]
Many local governments implemented restrictions to control the outbreak, including keeping schools closed, cutting off villages, and restricting travel.[citation needed]
China's Chunyun is the largest human migration in the world. It is a 40-day period when people return home to spend the Chinese New Year with their families.[216] In 2020, it started on 10 January and was to end on 18 February. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the government estimated 3 billion trips to be made during the period.[217]
On 9 January, a cross-ministry press conference regarding 2020 Chunyun was held. Wan Xiangdong, the Chief Pilot of the Civil Aviation Administration said that the agency would keep a close watch on the outbreak and strengthen ties with the health authorities. Li Wenxin, the Deputy General Manager of China Railway said that the railway authorities were paying attention to the situation and making sure to prevent the spread of the epidemic through the railway stations and trains and safeguard the health and safety of passengers. Wang Yang, the Chief Engineer of the Ministry of Transport said that the ministry would carry disinfection monitoring and protection measures out in areas with heavy passenger traffic including transport hubs, passenger stations, and cargo terminal factory stations.[218]
However, on 22 January, as the coronavirus outbreak escalated, Li Bin, the deputy president of NHC warned in a press conference that Chunyun might speed the transmission of the new virus up. Li repeated the government's previous advice to the people, that is, stay away from Wuhan. George F. Gao, the Director of China CDC also admitted to the conference that the virus can transmit between humans and there were also cases of community-acquired infections. The Chinese health officials also promised to take strict measures to stop the virus from spreading and release information as soon as possible.[219]
Meetings on coronavirus outbreak
On 20 January, the Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping ordered that great attention should be paid to prevention and control of the epidemic. The Party also vowed to "guide" people's opinions with intensive publicity strategies and interpretations of current policies in order to ensure social stability. Premier Li Keqiang urged relevant ministries and localities to take a highly responsible attitude towards the People's health and resolutely prevent the spread of the epidemic.[220][221] Premier Li Keqiang also called a meeting of the State Council's Executive Meeting and deployed the work of epidemic prevention and control.[222]
On 21 January, Premier Li visited a local hospital during a visit to Xining, Qinghai where he urged protection and encouraged the health care workers. The National Healthcare Security Administration decided to adopt a special reimbursement policy for confirmed patients and temporarily bring relevant drugs and medical services into the reimbursement scope of medical insurance.[223] On 22 January, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan went to Wuhan to inspect the prevention and control of the epidemic.[224]
On 26 January, Li Keqiang chaired the first meeting of the Central Leading Group for the Response to the Epidemic of Pneumonia Caused by 2019-nCoV infection. The meeting prioritized the provision of urgently needed medical and health forces, protective clothing and face masks for prevention and control in Hubei Province and Wuhan and attached importance to the transport of daily necessities for residents and relief supplies to Hubei. It urged the local governments to enhance epidemic control including cancelling meetings and events, strictly quarantining confirmed and suspected infection cases, extending the Chinese New Year holiday and supporting online office and teaching. The Central Government promised to crack down on hoarding and profiteering in materials for disease prevention and control. Public Finance at all levels should fully guarantee such funds as prevention and control of epidemic situations and treatment of the patients.[225]
On 27 January, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, entrusted by Party general secretary Xi Jinping according to Xinhua[226] arrived in Wuhan to inspect and guide the epidemic prevention and control work.[227][228] According to The Wall Street Journal, the appointment of Li who is considered a technocrat surprised some observers, given that he had been sidelined in recent years as Xi concentrated power and cultivated a populist ideological image, however some suggest that Xi was "more at risk to the political fallout of the coronavirus" while Li could be a convenient "political scapegoat".[229] Li's visit to Wuhan earned high popularity on Chinese social media.[230] Xi Jinping claimed that he "personally commanded" the fight against the coronavirus outbreak when meeting with WHO director general in Beijing on 28 January, but according to a report by The Guardian, he has not made any public presence since then as the social media posts mocking Xi's absence were promptly deleted by the censors.[231][229]
But, Xi finally made an appearance at a residential community in Chaoyang, Beijing on 10 February.[232] Xinhua posted photos of Xi wearing a mask and said that the aim of Xi's visit was "to learn about the situation of epidemic prevision and control at the grassroots level."[233] It was his first time to interact with the people since the outbreak after he paid a short visit to Yunnan during 19–21 January as a tradition that China's leaders observed to visit the smaller towns and villages before the Spring Festival. He was said to chair a meeting on 3 February by the state media, but no pictures or videos were released.[233] Xi also met Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the first foreign leader to visit China since the coronavirus outbreak on 5 February.[234]
Epidemic control efforts
The NHC with the approval of the State Council announced 2019-nCoV-associated pneumonia as Category B Infectious Diseases with control measures of Class A infectious diseases as stipulated in The Law on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases.[237] From 20 January, the NHC will publish daily data on confirmed and suspected cases in all provinces of the country (Including during the Spring Festival) until no longer necessary.[238] On 20 January, NHC set up a working group up to deal with pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection.[221] On 28 January, NHC sent seven supervision teams to seven provinces and cities in Beijing, Hebei, Shanghai, Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, and Sichuan to supervise the epidemic control measures in the areas.[239] China normally makes 10 million face masks per day, about half of the world production. During the crisis, 2,500 factories were converted to produce 116 million daily.[240]
On 1 February, the People's Bank of China and other five departments jointly issued the notice on further strengthening financial support for the prevention and control of the epidemic of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection, stating that relevant financial services will be further strengthened during the period affected by the epidemic. For those who are temporarily affected by the epidemic and facing difficulties, the document requires financial institutions to tilt their credit policies appropriately, flexibly adjust their loan repayment arrangements and reasonably postpone the repayment period. Those overdue due to inconvenient repayment during the epidemic period shall not be included in the record of credit investigation and breach of trust.[245]
On 30 January, the Ministry of Finance and NHC issued a notice on the financial guarantee policy for the prevention and control of the new type of pneumonia. The Central Government shall grant a subsidy of 300 yuan per person per day to those who are in direct contact with the cases to be investigated or confirmed who are involved in the diagnosis, treatment, nursing, hospital infection control, case specimen collection, and pathogen detection. For other medical personnel and epidemic prevention workers who take part in epidemic prevention and control, the Central Financial Department shall subsidize them at a rate of 200 yuan per person per day.[246]
The Ministry of Finance, the General Administration of Customs and the General Administration of Taxation issued a joint announcement that from 1 January to 31 March 2020, more preferential import tax policies will be implemented for imported materials used for epidemic prevention and control.[247]
Since the outbreak of the epidemic, a number of government officials have been publicly held accountable for their dereliction of duty in the epidemic prevention in 6 provinces.[248]
On 29 January, Director of Huanggang MHC Tang Zhihong failed to tell the capacity of the local hospitals including how many patients that they could handle, how many could be hospitalized and how many patients could be tested each day when asked about these questions despite being an administrator of the local hospitals.[249] A day later, the Party Committee of Huanggang proposed a removal of Tang from the post. On 1 February, according to the Mayor of Huanggang named Qui Lixin, the city authority disciplined 337 of its officials and removed 6 cadres who "caused disadvantages to the epidemic prevention".[250][251]
On 2 February, Zhang Cong, Party Secretary of Xuanhua, Hebei was admonished. Zhang Guoqing, Deputy Party Secretary of Xuanhua and Guo Xiaoyi, the political commissar of the local police were given disciplinary actions by the Party.[252][253] On the same day, February, Xiangshui, Jiangsu reported three cases of misconduct. The cases were associated with illegal disclosure of personal data and dereliction of duty. Party secretary, Zhang Changyue and deputy director Gu Bing of the Zhangji Health Center and the director of the Xiangshui CDC were removed or disciplined.[254]
Tang Hu, the director of the Health Bureau of the Nanhu New District in Yueyang, Hunan Province was suspended. Cai Junfeng, the deputy director of the Lengshuijiang Municipal Committee and Yang Wen, the deputy director of the municipal government office are suspended. He Yong, the deputy secretary of the Gutang Party Committee and township chief was suspended.[253]
On 15 February, Qiushi magazine documented a 7 January order by Xi Jinping, regarding the Covid-19 outbreak at a Politburo Standing Committee meeting.[257] However, a record of that same meeting released beforehand shows that there was zero mention of the epidemic throughout.[258][259]
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on 21 January that the Chinese authorities would share information of the epidemic "with the WHO, relevant nations and China's Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions in a timely manner including the genome sequence of the new coronavirus."[261]
During the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn praised China for its improved transparency since 2003.[11] US officials and WHO also praised China for sharing data about the epidemic and keeping transparent. The US experts had been invited by China's NHC.[10]
On 23 January, WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom and WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, Takeshi Kasai arrived in Beijing to discuss the new coronavirus outbreak with the Chinese authorities and health experts.[262] China agreed on 28 January that WHO would send international experts to China.[263]
However, John Mackenzie, a member of the World Health Organization's emergency committee criticized China for being too slow to share all of the infected cases, especially during major political meetings in Wuhan after Tedros Adhanom praised China for helping "prevent the spread of coronavirus to the other countries."[264]
Main article: Evacuations related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic
However, the evacuation halted after the first flight was found to carry an infected case. The Taiwanese government said that the person was not in the evacuation list and the most vulnerable were not included in the first flight. It also said that it was not prepared to take these people with a high risk of viral infections home.[271] Tsai Ing-wen criticized China's attempt to rule Taiwan out in WHO and said, "The information obtained by the WHO was obviously inaccurate ... and could cause the WHO to make mistakes in dealing with the global epidemic."[272] Premier Su Tseng-chang called for a government-to-government negotiation for the following arrangement of chapter flights[273] despite the fact that the cross-strait communication mechanism between governments had been suspended since 2016 when Tsai was elected president.[274]
The State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office urged the Taiwanese government to stop impeding the evacuation.[275] The office said that before the flight, all of the passengers signed a personal declaration claiming that they have no contact with any confirmed or suspected cases and promising to comply with quarantine measures after returning to the island. All of the passengers are checked for their temperature three times before the flight and showed no abnormality. The office said critically that the Taiwanese government first expressed appreciation before the flight, but changed its attitude after the flight.[276] Wuhan's Taiwan Affairs Office asked Taiwan for more details about the infected case as the basic descriptions of the patient including age and gender were not given as previously 17 cases in Taiwan. The office also said that the patient's close relatives were not at all informed of the viral infection.[277]
Further information: Travel restrictions related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic
Since 25 January 2020, all passengers entering or exiting mainland China in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong must write a health declaration where the individual must answer whether they have been to Hubei Province. This declaration form can also be filled by using WeChat.[278]
The State Administration of Immigration promised that the border inspection agencies at all ports of entry and exit in China would continue to provide necessary facilities and services for Chinese citizens returning home.[279] On 25 January, the General Administration of Customs reactivated the health declaration system where people entering or exiting mainland China are asked to write a health declaration. Border control staff shall also cooperate in health and quarantine work such as body temperature monitoring, medical inspection, and medical check-up.[280] On 31 January, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was arranging charter flights to take the Chinese citizens from Hubei and Wuhan back to Wuhan 124, given the practical difficulties that they faced overseas.[281]
Hubei suspended the processing of applications from mainland Chinese residents for entry and exit of mainland China. For those with a valid visa to enter Hong Kong and Macao, but fail to enter the areas due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese Immigration Administration will issue a new visa for free on request of the visa holder after the outbreak is lifted. Some of automated border clearance systems will be shut down according to the needs of the epidemic prevention. After Wuhan declared lockdown on 23 January, the Tianhe Airport and Hankou River ports have been without passengers for several days.[279]
Since 25 January,[282] Taiwan's government banned anyone from mainland China entering the country with[270] the ban extended to mainland Chinese overseas.[283] Although the global health officials advised not to apply travel restrictions on China, the US and Australia restricted all Chinese citizens from China from entering their borders.[284] Travel restrictions were announced by Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Italy and other countries despite China's criticism of border control.[285][286]
On 13 March, China sent medical supplies, including masks and respirators to Italy, together with a team of Chinese medical staff to help Italy fight the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Italy.[292][293][294] These were paid products and services.[295]
Main article: Xenophobia and racism related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic
Although there has been support from Chinese online towards those in virus-stricken areas,[296] instances of regional discrimination have also arisen.[31] According to World Journal, there have been instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels, having their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying "people from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not welcomed here." [297] Multiple hotels purportedly refused a Wuhan tour guide to check in after she returned to Hangzhou from Singapore with one of them calling the police to give her a health check and asking the police to quarantine her. Amidst these incidents, various cities and prefectures outside of Hubei adopted resettlement measures for Hubei people in their region such as designated hotel accommodation for visitors from the province.[298] In Zhengding, Jingxing and Luquan of Shijiazhuang City, the local governments rewarded anyone who reported those who had been to Wuhan, but not recorded in official documents at least 1,000 yuan RMB. In Meizhou, residents reporting people entering from Hunan were awarded with 30 face masks.[299]
It was reported that on a scheduled 27 January China Southern Airlines flight from Nagoya to Shanghai, some Shanghainese travellers refused to board with 16 others from Wuhan. Two of the Wuhan travellers were unable to board due to a fever while the Shanghainese on the spot alleged that the others had taken medicine to bypass the temperature check.[297] One of the Wuhan tourists protested on Weibo, "are they really my countrymen?", to which a Shanghai tourist who was purportedly at the scene replied that they did it to protect Shanghai from the virus.[298] Many netizens criticized the Wuhan tourists for travelling with a fever, although some also called for understanding and for Shanghainese not to regionally discriminate.[300][301]
Mainland Chinese overseas are being discriminated against during the coronavirus outbreak.[302] In Hong Kong, a Japanese noodle restaurant said on Facebook, "We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us." It claimed to refuse mainland Chinese customers.[303] In Japan, a sweet shop in Hakone and a ramen restaurant in Sapporo posted "no Chinese" signs outside.[304] Similar events were reported in South Korea.[302] French newspaper Courrier Picard published two articles headlined "Yellow alert" and "New yellow peril?" which may reflect the historical racist tropes about the Chinese.[304] Asians in general are also affected by the anti-China sentiment. Disinformation about Asian food and Asian communities are circulating. Videos showing Asian people eating bats go viral along with dehumanizing comments and implication of the cause of the virus outbreak.[305]

Document issued by the Wuhan Police ordering Li Wenliang to stop "spreading rumours" about a possible 'SARS virus' dated 3 January.
The first known infection by a new virus was reported in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. The early response by city authorities was accused of prioritising a control of information on the outbreak. A group of eight medical personnel, including Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist from Wuhan Central Hospital, who in late December posted warnings on a new coronavirus strain akin to SARS, were warned by Wuhan police for "spreading rumours" for likening it to SARS.[306][307]
By the time China had informed the World Health Organization of the new coronavirus on 31 December 2019, The New York Times reported that the government was still keeping "its own citizens in the dark".[308][309][310][311] While by a number of measures, China's initial handling of the crisis was an improvement in relation to the SARS response in 2003, China has been criticised for cover-ups and downplaying the initial discovery and severity of the outbreak. This has been attributed to the censorship institutional structure of the country's press and Internet, with Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times and Jude Blanchette of the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggesting that it was exacerbated by Xi Jinpings crackdown on independent oversight such as journalism that left senior officials with inaccurate information on the outbreak and "contributed to a prolonged period of inaction that allowed the virus to spread".[312][311][309]
On 20 January, Xi Jinping made his first public remark on the outbreak and spoke of "the need for the timely release of information".[313] Chinese premier Li Keqiang also urged efforts to prevent and control the epidemic.[314] One day later, the CPC Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the most powerful political organ in China overseeing legal enforcement and the police, wrote "self-deception will only make the epidemic worse and turn a natural disaster that was controllable into a man-made disaster at great cost," and "only openness can minimise panic to the greatest extent." The commission then added, "anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of cases out of self-interest will be nailed on a pillar of shame for eternity."[315][316] Also on the same day, Xi Jinping instructed authorities "to strengthen the guidance of public opinions", language which some view as a call for censorship after commentators on social media became increasingly pointedly critical and angry at the government due to the epidemic. Some view this as contradictory to the calls for "openness" that the central government had already declared.[317]
Statements issued by Xi Jinping on 3 February declared the need for an emphasis by state media on "telling the moving stories of how [people] on the front line are preventing and fighting the virus" as a priority of coverage, while top official Zhang Xiaoguo said that his department would "treat propaganda regarding the control and prevention measures of the virus as its top priority".[318][319] For instance, state media organisations People's Daily and Global Times, along with deputy director of information Zhao Lijian from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been observed to be publishing effusive praise on Beijing's response to the epidemic,[320] such as extensive coverage of the accelerated construction of the new hospitals in Wuhan (which Zhao claimed was completed in 16 hours),[13][321] the lock down of Wuhan with its population of 11 million, and the "unprecedented" quarantine of Hubei province. Though such efforts had a questional effect on the epidemic, as the new hospitals were operating at under half-capacity due to shortages of beds and medical resources[322][323] while the lock down of Wuhan came too late to be effective as millions had left, the Financial Times and others noted that such widely publicised actions were a "PR coup" showing that the "overbearing, centralized government" of China was particularly suited to dealing with the outbreak,[324][309][325] creating the impression as if Beijing had directly intervened at Xi Jinping's request.[326][310][327][312][326][310][327] Observers have warned that while "admiration of the front-line medical workers is widespread and sincere," the state media should also be highlighting the reality that many of those workers "lack protective gear" and that over 3000 have been infected since the outbreak so that media attention may bring them public support to obtain some much needed equipment. The New York Times has noted that such government propaganda attempts to control the narrative has been viewed with distrust among the younger individuals, who unlike older people depend less on state media and instead have sought "firsthand info and in-depth media studies concerning the epidemic on the web", suggesting that the central government was out of touch with the younger population.[328]
As part of the central government's "bifurcated approach to diffuse discontent", while the propaganda machinery was going into "overdrive...to protect [Xi Jinping's] reputation", citizens were permitted to criticise local officials so long as they did not "question the basic legitimacy of the party".[329] The Cyberspace Administration (CAC) declared its intent to foster a "good online atmosphere," with CAC notices sent to video platforms encouraging them to "not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus."[330] Censorship has been observed being applied on news articles and social media posts deemed to hold negative tones about the coronavirus and the governmental response, including posts mocking Xi Jinping for not visiting areas of the epidemic,[331] an article that predicted negative effects of the epidemic on the economy, and calls to remove local government officials.[312][332][333][319] Chinese citizens have reportedly used innovative methods to avoid censorship to express anger about how government officials have handled the initial outbreak response, such as using the word 'Trump' to refer to Xi Jinping, or 'Chernobyl' to refer to the outbreak as a whole.[318] Younger individuals have also been creating digital archives of media concerning the epidemic – which is prone to deletion by censors – and posting them on the exterior web.[328] While censorship had been briefly relaxed giving a "window of about two weeks in which Chinese journalists were able to publish hard-hitting stories exposing the mishandling of the novel coronavirus by officials", since then private news outlets were reportedly required to use "planned and controlled publicity" with the authorities' consent.[334][318][319]
On 30 January, China's Supreme Court, delivered a rare rebuke against the country's police forces, calling the "unreasonably harsh crackdown on online rumours" as undermining public trust. In what has been called a "highly unusual criticism" by observers, supreme court judge Tang Xinghua said that if police had been lenient against rumours and allowed the public to have taken heed of them, an earlier adoption of "measures like wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding wildlife markets" might have been useful in countering the spread of the epidemic.[335] The Human Rights Watch reported that "there is considerable misinformation on Chinese social media and authorities have legitimate reasons to counter false information that can cause public panic," but also noted censorship by the authorities on social media posted by families of infected people who were potentially seeking help as well as by people living in cordoned cities who were documenting their daily lives amidst the lockdown.[336]
After the death of Li Wenliang, who was widely hailed as a whistleblower in China on 7 February, some of the trending hashtags on Weibo such as "Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology" and "We want freedom of speech" were blocked.[337][338][319] While media outlets were allowed to report his death, the nature of the doctor's censorship which produced widespread public anger in the aftermath, in what has been described as "one of the biggest outpourings of online criticism of the government in years," was not a topic that was permitted for coverage.[339] After attempts to discourage the discussion on Dr. Li's death further escalated online anger, the central government has been accused of reportedly attempting to co-opt the incident by "cast[ing] Dr. Li's death as the nation's sacrifice – meaning, the Chinese Communist Party's own".[340] A group of Chinese academics including Xu Zhangrun of Tsinghua University signed an open letter calling for the central government to issue an apology to Dr. Li and to protect freedom of speech.[341] Professor Zhou Lian of Renmin University has observed that the epidemic has "allowed more people to see the institutional factors behind the outbreak and the importance of freedom of speech".[342]
Journalists in China have worked to publish information about the outbreak. The government initially allowed greater leeway than usual to reporters investigating the crisis, but then cracked down with greater censorship than usual.[35] On 12 March, ten Tibetans were arrested in connection to coronavirus rumours.[343][344]
The exodus from Wuhan before the lockdown resulted in angry responses on Sina Weibo from the residents in the other cities who are concerned that it could result in the spreading of the novel coronavirus to their cities. Some in Wuhan are concerned with the availability of provisions and especially medical supplies during the lockdown.[74][345]
The World Health Organization called the Wuhan lockdown "unprecedented" and said that it showed "how committed that the authorities are to contain a viral breakout". However, WHO clarified that the move is not a recommendation that WHO made and the authorities have to wait and see how effective that it is.[346] The WHO separately stated that the possibility of locking an entire city down like this is "new to science".[347]
The CSI 300 Index, an aggregate measure of the top 300 stocks in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, dropped almost 3% on 23 January 2020, the biggest single-day loss in almost 9 months after the Wuhan lockdown was announced as the investors that are spooked by the drastic measure sought a safe haven for their investments.[348]
The unprecedented scale of this lockdown generated controversy and at least one expert criticized this measure as "risky business" that "could very easily backfire" by forcing otherwise healthy people in Wuhan to stay in close conditions with infected people. Drawing a cordon sanitaire around a city of 11 million people raises inevitable ethical concerns. It also drew comparisons to the lockdown of the poor West Point neighborhood in Liberia during the 2014 ebola outbreak which was lifted after ten days.[349][350]
The lockdown caused panic in the city of Wuhan and many have expressed concern about the city's ability to cope with the outbreak. It remains unknown whether the large costs of this measure, both financially and in terms of personal liberty will translate to effective infection control.[347] A medical historian named Howard Markel argued that the Chinese government "may now be overreacting, imposing an unjustifiable burden on the population" and claimed that "incremental restrictions, enforced steadily and transparently tended to work far better than draconian measures."[351] Others such as Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases defended the intent behind the lockdowns, citing that the lockdowns bought the world a "delay to essentially prepare better." A mathematical epidemiologist named Gerardo Chowell of Georgia State University stated that based on mathematical modelling, "containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission."[352]
Nonetheless, after northern Italy became a new hotspot of the outbreak in late February, the Italian government enacted what has been called a "Wuhan-style lockdown" by quarantining nearly a dozen towns of 50,000 people in the provinces of Lombardy and Veneto.[353] Iran, another developing hotspot for the coronavirus as of 25 February came under calls to assume similar lockdown procedures as China and Italy. The security experts such as Gal Luft of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security in Washington said that "The best way for Iran to deal with the disease is to do precisely what China did – quarantine." and "If Wuhan with its 11 million population can be under quarantine so can Tehran with its 8 million"[354]
On 24, Zhang Ouya, the Chief Journalist of Hubei Daily called for the removal of the current leaders of Hubei and Wuhan on Weibo. But, he was asked to remove his post and the newspaper that he worked for apologized to the Wuhan authorities.[13] Mayor Zhou of Wuhan said to the state media on 27, "As a local government, I could not disclose information until I get information and authorization which was not understood at the time."[355] His argument which hinted at the Central Government's responsibility,[355] was refuted by China CDC. Chief Scientist Zeng Guang said to Chinese tabloid The Global Times that what the scientists said was "often only part of their decision-making" and praised the eight whistleblowers who were warned by the Wuhan authorities before the epidemic.[356]
Hubei Government's press meeting on 26 January was described as a "scene of a massive car crash" by BBC which led to widespread dissatisfaction. Despite the compulsory face mask law, Governor Wang Xiaodong did not wear a mask while the other two official hosts including Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang and Provincial Party Secretary Bie Bixiong wore masks incorrectly. The Governor said Xiantao, a Hubei city was capable to produce 10.8 billion masks annually after he made two corrections for the number hinted by someone else's notes. The Governor admitted a severe shortage of medical supplies in Hubei while Mayor Zhou of Wuhan claimed that the shortage had been fully alleviated.[357]
In the early stage of the coronavirus outbreak, eight people were summoned by Wuhan police for their claim that there were SARS cases in Wuhan.[13] According to Wang Gaofei, Weibo's CEO, the eight people are all doctors at Wuhan hospitals who "are still fighting at the frontline".[74] The Supreme Court defended these doctors and pointed out in a WeChat article on 28 January,[74] delay and opacity in public information are the root of fake news and the information that is mostly factual and not subjectively malicious and causes no objectively severe consequences should be tolerated.[358] On 29 January, the eight doctors were also praised by Zeng Guang, Chief Scientist at China CDC.[356][359]
Hu Xijin, the editor of the Global Times, complained about the local governments' low tolerance of differing online opinions and believed this weakened checks-and-balances of government powers through news media.[13]
Death of Li Wenliang
Li Wenliang was a Wuhan ophthalmologist who is believed to have been one of the whistleblowers of the coronavirus outbreak. He was warned by a Wuhan police after he said that there were SARS cases at Huanan Seafood Market on WeChat. The doctor was later diagnosed with the coronavirus infection and died from it on 7 February 2020. He was said to be dead on the evening of 6 February, although the hospital said that he was still under emergency treatment. People speculated that Dr. Li was actually kept alive[further explanation needed] while the authorities were trying to censor the news. After his death, people mourned his death and criticized the government.[360] "We want the freedom of speech" and "Wuhan's government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology" became trending topics on Weibo until the posts were deleted by censors.[361] Financial Times believed Li's story fitted the historical archetypes in China where incorruptible Confucian scholar who speaks truth to the emperor but is persecuted and ultimately dies for his honesty.[362]
Financial Times described the outbreak as China's Chernobyl moment, increasing the pressure on its leader, Xi Jinping. A trade war with the US, Hong Kong protests, and an African swine fever outbreak that led to a pork shortage already placed pressure on the current government.[362][363]
On 29 January, the Ministry of Science and Technology issued a notice, urging the scientists "to write their papers on the land of the motherland, to use the results to fight the epidemic" and the scientists should not focus on publishing their papers until the epidemic prevention and control task is completed.[364] DuoWei News believed this was aimed to respond to the academic conflict between Zhang Yongzhen's group from Fudan University which published the first genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV and the Gao Shan group from Nankai University which published an analysis[365] on the sequence without authorization from Zhang. Before the notice, Nankai and Fudan, two of China's top universities had a fight over the alleged academic misconduct related to the analysis published by the Gao Shan group.[366]
The journal Nature reported at least 54 papers about the new coronavirus in China were published during the 20-day period between 10–30 January, but none of them was a Chinese language article.[370] Zuofeng Zhang, a public health expert from UCLA interviewed by the mainland China-based magazine Intellectual, asked why the published data were not used in epidemic control even before their publication.[371]
Main article: Misinformation related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic
According to London-based The Economist, China's internet is full of conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being the CIA's creation to keep China down.[372] Although biological warfare against Chinese troops in the Korean war is only considered an allegation in the US, it is considered official history in China, thus greatly helping these new theories gain credibility.[373]
Multiple conspiracy articles in Chinese from the SARS era resurfaced during the outbreak with altered details, claiming that SARS is biological warfare conducted by the US against China. Some of these articles claim that BGI Group from China sold genetic information of the Chinese people to the US, with the US then being able to deploy the virus specifically targeting the genome of Chinese individuals.[374]
On 26 January, Chinese military news site Xilu published an article detailing how the virus was artificially combined by the US to "precisely target Chinese people".[375] The article was removed after early February.[citation needed]
Some articles on popular sites in the Chinese have also cast suspicion on US military athletes participating in the Wuhan 2019 Military World Games, which lasted until the end of October 2019, and have suggested that they deployed the virus. They claim the inattentive attitude and disproportionately below-average results of American athletes in the games indicate they might have been there for other purposes and they might actually be bio-warfare operatives. Such posts stated that their place of residence during their stay in Wuhan was also close to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first known cluster of cases occurred.[376][373]
In March 2020, this conspiracy theory was endorsed by Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.[377][378][379] On 13 March, the US government summoned Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai to Washington DC over the coronavirus conspiracy theory.[380]
The case count in mainland China only includes symptomatic cases. It excludes patients who test positive but do not have symptoms, of which there were more than 43,000 by the end of February 2020.[381][382][383]

The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic spread to many countries around the world, with the most affected countries being the United States, Italy, Spain, China, France, Iran, and South Korea.[1] National response measures have been varied, and have included containment measures such as lockdowns, quarantines, and curfews. This is a dynamic list of different responses by various nations across the world.[2]

Quarantine total 59,172,000 67,801 3,160 60,323 4,318
Outbreak ongoing: Infection and fatality data as of 21:59 (UTC+8) 24 March 2020.[12][13] Totals will evolve.
The first person known to have fallen ill due to the new virus was in Wuhan on 1 December 2019.[14] A public notice on the outbreak was released by Wuhan health authority on 31 December; the initial notice informed Wuhan residents that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, that the disease is preventable and controllable, and that people can wear masks when going out.[15] WHO was informed of the outbreak on the same day.[16]
On 7 January 2020, the Chinese Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee discussed novel coronavirus prevention and control.[17][18]
On 20 January, Zhong Nanshan, a scientist at China's National Health Commission who played a prominent role in the SARS epidemic, declared its potential for human-to-human transmission, after two cases emerged in Guangdong of infection by family members who had visited Wuhan.[19] This was later confirmed by the Wuhan government, which announced a number of new measures such as cancelling the Chinese New Year celebrations, in addition to measures such as checking the temperature of passengers at transport terminals first introduced on 14 January.[20] A quarantine was announced on 23 January 2020 stopping travel in and out of Wuhan.[21]
On 25 January, Chinese authorities banned the use of private vehicles in Wuhan. Only vehicles that are transporting critical supplies or emergency response vehicles are allowed to move within the city.[22]
On 26 January, a leading group tasked with the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus pandemic was established, led by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.[23][24] The leading group decided to extend the Spring Festival holiday to contain the outbreak.[25]
China Customs started requiring that all passengers entering and exiting China fill in an extra health declaration form from 26 January. The health declaration form was mentioned in China's Frontier Health and Quarantine Law, granting the customs rights to require it if needed.[26][27][28]
On 27 January, the General Office of the State Council of China, one of the top governing bodies of the People's Republic, officially declared a nation-wide extension on the New Year holiday and the postponement of the coming spring semester. The office extended the previously scheduled public holiday from 30 January, to 2 February, while it said school openings for the spring semester would be announced in the future.[29] Some universities with open campuses also banned the public from visiting.[30] On 23 January, the education department in Hunan, which neighbours the centre of the outbreak Hubei province, stated it would strictly ban off-school tutors and restrict student gatherings.[31] Education departments in Shanghai and Shenzhen also imposed bans on off-school tutoring and requested that schools track and report students who had been to Wuhan or Hubei province during the winter break.[32][33] The semi-autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau also announced adjustments on schooling schedules. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam declared an emergency at a press conference on 25 January, saying the government would close primary and secondary schools for two more weeks on top of the previously scheduled New Year holiday, pushing the date for school reopening to 17 February.[34][35] Macau closed several museums and libraries, and prolonged the New Year holiday break to 11 February for higher education institutions and 10 February for others.[36] The University of Macau said they would track the physical conditions of students who have been to Wuhan during the New Year break.[37]
[[A Screen Display During Wuhan Coronavirus Outbreak.jpg|A screen display in Hefei showing "early detection, early reporting, early quarantine, early diagnosis, early treatment" during the coronavirus pandemic|link=Special:FilePath/A_Screen_Display_During_Wuhan_coronavirus_pandemic.jpg]] On 1 February 2020, Xinhua News reported that China's Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) has "asked procuratorates nationwide to fully play their role to create a favourable judicial environment in the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic." This includes severe punishments for those found guilty of dereliction of duty and the withholding of information for officials. Tougher charges were proscribed for commercial criminal activities such as "the pushing up of prices, profiteering and severely disturbing market order" along with the "production and sale of fake and shoddy protective equipment and medicines." Prosecuting actions against patients who deliberately spread the infection or refuse examination or compulsory isolation along with threats of violence against medical personnel were also urged. The statement also included urging to prosecute those found "fabricating coronavirus-related information that may lead to panic among the public, making up and spreading rumours about the virus, sabotaging the implementation of the law and endangering public security" and also stressed "harshly punishing the illegal hunting of wildlife under state protection, as well as improving inspection and quarantine measures for fresh food and meat products."[43]
Main article: 2020 Hubei lockdowns
On 23 January 2020, a quarantine on travel in and out of Wuhan was imposed in an effort to stop the spread of the virus out of Wuhan. Flights, trains, public buses, the metro system, and long-distance coaches were suspended indefinitely. Large-scale gatherings and group tours were also suspended.[21] By 24 January 2020, a total of 15 cities in Hubei, including Wuhan, were placed under similar quarantine measures.[48] On 27 and 28 January 2020, Xiangyang closed its railway stations and suspended all ferry operations, after shutting down its airport and intercity bus services earlier. Thus, the entire Hubei province entered a city-by-city quarantine, save for the Shennongjia Forestry District.[citation needed]
Before the quarantine began, some in Wuhan questioned the reliability of the figures from the Chinese government as well as the government response, with some calling for quarantine,[49] and a post also showed sick people and three dead bodies covered in white sheets on the floor of a hospital on 24 January, although many such posts in Weibo about the epidemic have since been deleted.[50][51]
Due to quarantine measures, Wuhan residents rushed to stockpile essential goods, food, and fuel; prices rose significantly.[52][53] 5,000,000 people left Wuhan, with 9,000,000 left in the city.[54]
On 26 January, the city of Shantou in Guangdong declared a partial lockdown,[55] though this was reversed two hours later.[56] Residents had rushed to supermarkets to stock food as soon as the lockdown was declared, until the authorities reversed their decision. Caixin said, that the wording of Shantou's initial declaration was "unprecedentedly strict" and will severely affect residents' lives, if implemented as-is. Shantou's Department for Outbreak Control later clarified that it would not restrict travelling, but would sterilise vehicles used for transportation.[57]
Local authorities in Beijing and several other major cities, including Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, announced on 26 January, that these cities will not impose a lockdown similar to those in Hubei province. Rumours of these potential lockdowns had spread widely prior to the official announcements.[58] A spokesperson of Beijing's Municipal Transportation Commission claimed that the expressways, highways, subways, and buses were operating normally. To ease the residents' panic, the Hangzhou city government stressed that the city would not be locked down from the outside world, and both cities said that they would introduce precautions against potential risks.[59]
On 2 February 2020, the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang also implemented a partial lockdown, closing 46 of the 54 highway checkpoints.[60]
Outside mainland China, some cruise ships were quarantined after passengers developed symptoms or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The Costa Smeralda was quarantined on 30 January off Civitavecchia in Italy, after passengers developed flu-like symptoms – the quarantine was lifted when tests for the virus came back negative.[63] Two further ships were quarantined on 5 February: Diamond Princess in the Port of Yokohama, Japan and World Dream, which returned to Hong Kong after being refused entry to Kaohsiung, Taiwan. In both cases, passengers and crew tested positive.[64][65][66][67] On 10 February passengers were allowed to disembark the World Dream "without the need to self-quarantine after leaving."[68]

On 1 February, Huanggang, Hubei implemented a measure whereby only one person from each household is permitted to go outside for provisions once every two days, except for medical reasons or to work at shops or pharmacies.[73]
Speciality hospitals[edit]
A speciality hospital named Huoshenshan Hospital has been constructed as a countermeasure against the outbreak and to better quarantine the patients. Wuhan City government had demanded that a state-owned enterprise construct such a hospital "at the fastest speed" comparable to that of the SARS outbreak in 2003.[107] On 24 January, Wuhan authorities specified its planning, saying they planned to have Huoshenshan Hospital built within six days of the announcement and it will be ready to use on 3 February. Upon opening, the speciality hospital has 1,000 beds[108] and takes up 30,000 square metres. The hospital is modelled after the Xiaotangshan Hospital [zh], which was fabricated for the SARS outbreak of 2003, itself built in only seven days.[109][110] State media reported that there were 7,000 workers and nearly 300 units of construction machinery on the site at peak.[111]
On 24 January 2020, the authority announced that they would convert an empty building in Huangzhou District, Huanggang to a 1,000-bed hospital named Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Centre. Works began the next day by 500 personnel and the building began accepting patients on 28 January 2020 at 10:30 pm.[112] In Wuhan, authorities have seized dormitories, offices and hospitals to create more beds for patients.[113] On 25 January authorities announced plans for Leishenshan Hospital, a second speciality hospital, with a capacity of 1,600 beds;[114] operations are scheduled to start by 6 February.[115][116] Some people voiced their concerns through social media services, saying the authorities' decision to build yet another hospital in such little time showed the severity of the outbreak could be a lot worse than expected.[117] The hospital opened on 8 February.[118]
14 temporary hospitals were constructed in China in total, but all were reported to have closed after the crisis was determined be under control on 10 March 2020.[119]
Jinyintan Hospital had initially been tasked with treating those with the coronavirus.

Document issued by the Wuhan Police ordering Li Wenliang to stop "spreading rumours" about a possible 'SARS virus' dated 3 January.
The early response by city authorities was criticised as prioritising a control of information that might be unfavorable for local officials over public safety, and China was also criticised for cover-ups and downplaying the initial discovery and severity of the outbreak. By the time China had informed the WHO of the new coronavirus on 31 December 2019, The New York Times reported that the government was still keeping "its own citizens in the dark".[121][122] Observers have attributed this to the censorship institutional structure of the country's press and Internet, exacerbated by China's paramount leader Xi Jinping's crackdown on independent oversight such as journalism and social media that left senior officials with inaccurate information on the outbreak and "contributed to a prolonged period of inaction that allowed the virus to spread".[121][122][123][124] The Human Rights Watch also noted censorship by the authorities of social media posts from families of infected people who were potentially seeking help as well as by people living in cordoned cities who were documenting their daily lives amidst the lockdown.[125]
A group of eight medical personnel, including Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist from Wuhan Central Hospital who in late December posted warnings on a new coronavirus strain akin to SARS, were taken into custody by Wuhan police and threatened with prosecution for "spreading rumours" for likening it to SARS.[126][127] Li Wenliang later died of the disease on 7 February, and was widely hailed as a whistleblower in China, but some of the trending hashtags on Weibo such as "Wuhan government owes Dr Li Wenliang an apology" and "We want freedom of speech" were blocked.[128][129][130] His death widespread public anger in the aftermath, in what has been described as "one of the biggest outpourings of online criticism of the government in years," was not a topic that was permitted for coverage.[131] One media outlet sent notices to editors, and leaked to reporters, asking them to refrain from "commenting or speculating" and giving instructions to "not hashtag and let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information."[132][133]
On 20 January, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping made his first public remark on the outbreak and spoke of "the need for the timely release of information".[134] One day later, the CPC Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the most powerful political organ in China overseeing legal enforcement and the police, wrote "self-deception will only make the epidemic worse and turn a natural disaster that was controllable into a man-made disaster at great cost," and "only openness can minimise panic to the greatest extent." The commission then added, "anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of cases out of self-interest will be nailed on a pillar of shame for eternity."[135][136] Xi Jinping later also instructed authorities "to strengthen the guidance of public opinions", language which some view as a call for censorship after commentators on social media became increasingly pointedly critical and angry at the government due to the epidemic.[137] on 30 January, China's Supreme Court, delivered a rare rebuke against the country's police forces, calling the "unreasonably harsh crackdown on online rumours" as undermining public trust. The supreme court judge Tang Xinghua said that if police had been lenient against rumours and allowed the public to have taken heed of them, an earlier adoption of "measures like wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding wildlife markets" might have been useful in countering the spread of the epidemic.[138]
As part of the central government's "bifurcated approach to diffuse discontent", citizens were permitted to criticise local officials so long as they did not "question the basic legitimacy of the party".[139] The Cyberspace Administration (CAC) declared its intent to foster a "good online atmosphere," with CAC notices sent to video platforms encouraging them to "not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus."[140] Censorship has been observed being applied on news articles and social media posts deemed to hold negative tones about the coronavirus and the governmental response, including posts mocking Xi Jinping for not visiting areas of the epidemic,[141] an article that predicted negative effects of the epidemic on the economy, and calls to remove local government officials.[124][128][142][143] While censorship had been briefly relaxed giving a "window of about two weeks in which Chinese journalists were able to publish hard-hitting stories exposing the mishandling of the novel coronavirus by officials", since then private news outlets were reportedly required to use "planned and controlled publicity" with the authorities' consent.[128][144]
On 29 January, President Trump received a briefing on the coronavirus in China.
China's response to the virus, in comparison to the 2003 SARS outbreak, has been praised by some foreign leaders.[145] U.S. President Trump thanked Chinese leader Xi Jinping "on behalf of the American People" on 24 January on Twitter, stating that "China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency" and declaring that "It will all work out well."[146] Germany's health minister Jens Spahn, in an interview on Bloomberg TV, said with comparison to the Chinese response to SARS in 2003: "There's a big difference to SARS. We have a much more transparent China. The action of China is much more effective in the first days already." He also praised the international co-operation and communication in dealing with the virus.<[147][148] In a letter to Xi, Singaporean president Halimah Yacob applauded China's "swift, decisive and comprehensive measures" in safeguarding the health of the Chinese people, while prime minister Lee Hsien Loong remarked of "China's firm and decisive response" in communities affected by the virus.[149] Similar sentiments were expressed by Russian president Vladimir Putin.[150]
At a Sunday mass at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City on 26 January, Pope Francis praised "the great commitment by the Chinese community that has already been put in place to combat the epidemic" and commenced a closing prayer for "the people who are sick because of the virus that has spread through China".[151]

All South Korean military bases were on lockdown after tests confirmed that three soldiers were indeed positive for the virus.[223] Airlines cut connections and cultural schedules were being cancelled due to fears of further spread.[225][226] United States Forces Korea raised the alert level from low to moderate and cut off non-essential travel to and from USFK Daegu.[227] USFK Daegu's school facilities were closed and non-essential personnel were ordered to stay at home while any visitors going there were not allowed to enter.[227] USFK announced that the widow of a retired soldier who was in Daegu was diagnosed to be positive for the virus on 24 February.[228] Camp Humphreys enacted virus detection protocols, including temperature checks and raised the alert level to high.[229] On 26 February, an American soldier based at Camp Carroll was diagnosed to be positive and was quarantined away from bases via off-base housing unit[230] with contact tracing done that showed his movements to Camp Walker.[231]
As of 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 reported symptoms.[232] At the time, 169 confirmed cases involved the church and another 111 came from the Cheongdo Daenam Hospital.[233] 23 February saw another 123 cases with 75 being from Shincheonji[234] and 24 February saw 161 additional cases with 129 being from the religious group.

On 24 February 15 countries imposed travel restrictions to and from South Korea.[236] It was also reported that a senior health official overseeing the COVID-19 efforts in Daegu tested positive and was also a member of Shincheonji.[237][238] Within a few days, a petition to the nation's president urging for the disbandment of the church had over 750,000 signatures. Their headquarters in Gwacheon was raided by law enforcement; government officials said all 245,000 members of the religious group would be found and tested.[238] On 28 February, over 2,000 confirmed cases were reported,[239] rising to 3,150 on 29 February.[240]

Koike also asked "if possible, work at home and refrain from going out at night as much as possible on weekdays." Koike asked people returning from abroad to refrain from going out for 14 days.[52] The request from the governor appears to have punctured the relaxed mood in Tokyo. “Panic buying” began to trend on Twitter, with users posting pictures of empty shelves and lines outside supermarkets. At the Don Qujiote store in Nakameguro on Wednesday, customers flocked to grab instant noodles and canned goods in the minutes immediately following Koike’s late-evening speech.[53]

In Kanagawa, residents were asked to refrain from nonessential travel on the weekend. The residents of Chiba, Yamanashi, Tochigi and Gunma Prefectures were asked to refrain from going to Tokyo over the weekend.[55]
Phase 1: Containment[edit]
The initial response of the Japanese government to the COVID-19 outbreak was a policy of containment that focused on the repatriation of Japanese citizens from Wuhan, the point of origin of the pandemic, and the introduction of new border control regulations.
On 24 January, PM Abe convened the "Ministerial Meeting on Countermeasures Related to the Novel Coronavirus" at the Prime Minister's Office with members of his Cabinet in response to a statement released by the World Health Organization (WHO) that morning which confirmed human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus. Abe announced that he would introduce appropriate countermeasures to the disease in coordination with the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID).[56]
On 28 January, PM Abe designated the new coronavirus as an "infectious disease" under the Infectious Diseases Control Law (Japanese: 感染症の予防及び感染症の患者に対する医療に関する法律), which allows the government to order patients with COVID-19 to undergo hospitalization. He also designed the disease as a "quarantinable infectious disease" under the Quarantine Act, which allows the government to quarantine people suspected of infection and order them to undergo diagnosis and treatment.[57]
On 30 January, PM Abe announced the establishment of the "Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters" (Japanese: 新型コロナウイルス感染症対策本部), which meets at the Prime Minister's Office and is run by a task force led by Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary for Crisis Management Okita Yoshiki.[58][59] The initial roster of the task force includes 36 high-ranking bureaucrats from several of the Ministries of Japan to coordinate government response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The Headquarters acts as the site of PM Abe's decision-making process on the country's virus countermeasures.
On 31 January, PM Abe announced during the Second Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters that the government prioritized the repatriation of Japanese citizens from Hubei province. Officials negotiated with Chinese authorities to dispatch five chartered flights to Wuhan from 29 January to 17 February.[60]
On 1 February, PM Abe announced during the Fourth Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters that he would enact restrictions to deny entry of foreign citizens who had a history of visiting Hubei province within 14 days and those who possess a Chinese passport issued by Hubei province.[61]
On 5 February, PM Abe announced that he would invoke the Quarantine Act to place the cruise ship Diamond Princess under quarantine in Yokohama. Quarantine officers were dispatched to the ship to prevent the disembarkation of crew and passengers, and to escort infected patients to medical facilities.[62]
On 6 February, PM Abe invoked the Immigration Control and Refugee Act to deny the entry of the cruise ship MS Westerdam from Hong Kong after one of its passengers tested positive for COVID-19.[63]

After the COVID-19 outbreak on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, the Japanese government shifted its focus from a containment policy to a prevention and treatment one because it anticipated rising numbers of community spreads within Japan. This policy prioritized the creation of a COVID-19 testing and consultation system based on the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and the government's existing 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that is separate from the civilian hospital system. The new system handles the transfer of COVID-19 patients to mainstream medical facilities to facilitate patient flow, triage, and the management of limited testing kits on their behalf to prevent a rush of infected and uninfected patients from overwhelming healthcare providers and transmitting diseases to them. By regulating COVID-19 testing at the national level, the Abe Administration integrated the activities of the national government, the local governments, medical professionals, business operators, and the public in treating the disease.
On 1 February, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare instructed the municipal and prefectural governments to establish specialized COVID-19 consultation centres and outpatient wards at their local public health facilities by the first half of the month.[64] Such wards would provide medical examinations and testing for suspected carriers of the disease to protect general hospitals from infection.
On 5 February, PM Abe announced during the Fifth Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters that the government would begin preparations to strengthen COVID-19 testing capabilities at the NIID and 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that are designated by the government as official testing sites. Without any uniform diagnosis kit for the disease, the government has relied on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to check for infections. As few mainstream medical facilities in Japan had the ability to conduct PCR tests, Abe also promised to increase the number of institutions with such kits, including universities and private companies [65]
On 12 February, PM Abe announced during the Seventh Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Headquarters that the government would expand the scope of COVID-19 testing to include patients with symptoms based on the discretion of local governments. Previously, testing was restricted to those with a history of travelling to Hubei Province.[66][67]　On the same day, the Ministry of Health and NIID also contracted SRL Inc to handle PCR clinical laboratory testing.[68] Since then, the government has partnered with several more private companies to expand laboratory testing capabilities and to work towards the development of a rapid testing kit.[69]
On 14 February, PM Abe introduced the Japanese government's coronavirus consultation system to coordinate medical testing and response with the public. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare worked with local governments to establish 536 consultation centres (Japanese: 帰国者・接触者相談センター) that covered every prefecture within the country to provide concerned citizens with instructions on how to receive COVID-19 testing and treatment. The general public needs to contact a consultation centre by phone to get tested at one of the government's specialized outpatient wards (Japanese: 帰国者・接触者外来).[70][71]
On 16 February, PM Abe convened the government's first Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting (Japanese: 新型コロナウイルス感染症対策専門家会議) at the Prime Minister's Office to draft national guidelines for COVID-19 testing and treatment.[72] The meeting was chaired by Dr. Wakita Takaji, Director of the NIID, who brought together ten public health experts and medical professionals from across Japan to coordinate a response to the virus with PM Abe and the government's coronavirus task force in a roundtable format. The main concern of the Japanese medical establishment was an overcrowding of hospitals by uninfected patients with light cold symptoms who believed that they had COVID-19. Medical representatives claimed that such a panic would strain medical resources and risk exposing those uninfected patients to the disease itself.[73][74]
On 17 February, the Ministry of Health released its consultation guidelines (Japanese: 新型コロナウイルス感染症についての相談・受診の目安について) to each of the municipal and prefectural governments and their public health centers.[75] The document instructs doctors and public health nurses who staff the consultation centres to limit consultations to people with the following conditions: (1) cold symptoms and a fever of at least 37.5 Celsius for over four days while taking antipyretic medication; and (2) extreme fatigue and breathing difficulties. The elderly, people with pre-existing conditions, and pregnant women with cold symptoms can receive consultation if they have had them for two days. The guidelines also note that people who are dissatisfied with their consultation results can visit one of the specialized outpatient wards (帰国者・接触者外来) for further talks.
Phase 2: Mitigation[edit]
On 25 February, the Abe Administration introduced the "Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control" (Japanese: 新型コロナウイルス感染症対策の基本方針) to act as the government's uniform basic policy on COVID-19 control.[76] After a spike of infections in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, PM Abe decided that the government's disease countermeasures would prioritize the prevention of large-scale clusters in Japan. This includes the government's controversial requests to suspend such large-scale gatherings as community events and school operations, as well as its policy to limit patients with light cold symptoms from visiting medical facilities to prevent them from overwhelming hospital resources.[77]
On 23 February, PM Abe instructed the government's coronavirus task force to quickly draft a comprehensive basic policy.[78] Health Minister Katsunobu Kato reconvened the medical experts from the first Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting on 24 February to draft this policy.[79] During the meeting, the medical establishment presented its policy recommendations in the form of a views report (Japanese: 新型コロナウイルス感染症対策の基本方針の具体化に向けた見解), concluding that the most important objective of PM Abe's basic policy must be the prevention of large-scale disease clusters and a decrease in the outbreak and death of patients with severe symptoms. They stated that it is not possible for the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Japan on a person-to-person basis, but that there is a possibility that it can regulate the overall speed of infection.[80]  They cited the next week or two as a "critical moment" on whether the country would experience a large cluster that could result in the collapse of the medical system and socio-economic chaos. After reviewing and discussing the existing data on the disease, the committee stated that universal PCR testing was impossible due to a shortage of testing facilities and providers, and recommended that the government instead limit the application of available test kits to patients that are at a high risk of complications in order to stockpile for a large cluster.  Participants also noted that Japan's medical facilities are vulnerable to "chaos," elaborating that several of the hospital beds and resources in the Tokyo area are already preoccupied with caring for the surge of 700 infected patients from the Diamond Princess. They reiterated their warning that a rush of alarmed uninfected outpatients with light symptoms of the disease could overwhelm hospitals and turn waiting rooms into "breeding grounds" of COVID-19.[81]
On 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the "Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.
First, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions – to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.[81]
Second, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.
Third, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.
On 27 February, the Japanese government also announced plans to expand the national health insurance system so that it covers COVID-19 tests.[83]
On 9 March, the Ministry of Health reconvened the Expert Meeting after the two week "critical moment." The panel of medical experts concluded that Japan was currently not on track to experience a large-scale cluster, but stated that there is a two-week time lag in analysing COVID-19 trends and that the country would continue to see more infections. Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters. With more COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, the panel also proposed that new infections from abroad could initiate a "second wave" of the disease in Japan.[84][85]
On 9 March, the Health Ministry published a disease forecast of each prefecture and instructed their local governments to prepare their hospitals to accommodate its patient estimates. It predicts that the virus peak of each prefecture will occur three months after their first reported case of local transmission. The Ministry estimates that during its peak, Tokyo will see 45,400 outpatients and 20,500 inpatients per day, of whom 700 will be in severe condition. For Hokkaido, the figure is 18,300 outpatients and 10,200 inpatients daily, of whom about 340 will be in severe condition.[86]
Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting[edit]
On 16 February, PM Abe convened the Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting to incorporate members of the Japanese medical community into his decision-making process.[72] The panel acts as the main medical advisory body of the Japanese government during the COVID-19 crisis.

On 25 February, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare established a "Cluster Response Section" (Japanese: クラスター対策班) in accordance to the Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control.[87] The purpose of the new section is to quickly identify and contain small-scale clusters of COVID-19 infections before they turn into large-scale ones. It is led by university professors Oshitani Hitoshi and Nishiura Hiroshi and consists of a contact trace team and a surveillance team from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), a data analysis team from Hokkaido University, a risk management team from Tohoku University, and an administration team.[88] Whenever a local government determines the existence of a cluster from hospital reports, the Ministry of Health dispatches the Section to that area to conduct an epidemiological survey and contact tracing. After the teams determine the original source of infection, the Ministry and local government officials enact countermeasures to locate, test, and place under medical surveillance anybody who may have come into contact with an infected person. They can also file requests to suspend infected businesses or restrict events from taking place there.
On 15 March, the Ministry of Health reported fifteen COVID-19 clusters in Japan.[89] The largest cluster involves more than 80 people across four live music clubs in Osaka from concerts held in mid-February.[90] Another cluster of 50 people occurred at an elderly day care centre in Nagoya in early March, which resulted in 12 deaths.[91]
To provide a stronger legal basis for its COVID-19 countermeasures, the Abe Administration has proposed an amendment to the "Special Measures Act to Counter New Types of Influenza of 2012" that will allow it to declare a "state of emergency" and mandate the prohibition of large-scale gatherings and the movement of people during a disease outbreak. Currently, school closures and event cancellations are voluntary responses by the public and local governments.
On 5 February 2020, the Abe Administration's coronavirus task force initiated political debate on the introduction of emergency measures to combat the COVID-19 outbreak a day after the British cruise ship Diamond Princess was asked to quarantine. Initial debate focused on constitutional reform due to the task force's apprehension that the Japanese Constitution may restrict the government's ability to enact such compulsory measures as quarantines on the grounds that it violated human rights. After lawmakers representing almost all of the major political parties – including the Liberal Democratic Party, Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and Democratic Party for the People – voiced their strong opposition towards this proposal and asserted that the Constitution allowed for emergency measures, the Abe Administration moved forward with legislative reform instead.[92]
On 5 March 2020, Prime Minister Abe introduced a draft amendment to the "Special Measures Act to Counter New Types of Influenza of 2012". He met separately with the heads of five opposition parties on 4 March to promote a "united front" in passing the reforms. The new law would allow the national and prefectural governors to instruct residents to avoid unnecessary outings and to close such facilities as schools, day care centres, and social welfare facilities for the elderly. To allay the concerns of the opposition parties, Abe said he would include a two-year limit on the power to declare a state of emergency.[93]
On 12 February, PM Abe announced during the Eighth Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters that the government would secure a total of 500 billion yen for emergency lending and loan guarantees to small and medium enterprises affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.[95] He also declared that his Cabinet would set aside 15.3 billion yen from contingency funds to facilitate the donation of isolated virus samples to relevant research institutions across the globe.
On 1 March, PM Abe evoked the Act on Emergency Measures for Stabilizing Living Conditions of the Public to regulate the sale and distribution of facial masks in Hokkaido. Under this policy, the Japanese government instructed manufactures to sell facial masks directly to the government, which would then deliver it to residents.[96]
On 5 March, the Japanese government announced that it is organizing an emergency package by using a 270 billion yen ($2.5 billion) reserve fund for the current fiscal year through March to contain the virus and minimize its impact on the economy.
From 17 February, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare asked people who have a fever over 37.5 ℃ for more than 4 days or those who have recognized strong helplessness and difficulty breathing severer than such conditions for influenza are necessary to find and consult with the coronavirus-related 'Return and Contact Consultation Center' installed in local governments around the country before get tested for novel coronavirus.[97][98] However, some media outlets assert that restrictive and deliberate standards would rather delay response and create a socially loose atmosphere, leading to the spread of the disease, which could later lead to the collapse of the health care system and the medically protected regional community.[99]
In late February, several Japanese media outlets reported that there were people with fever or other symptoms who could not be tested through the consultation centre system and had become "test refugees" (Japanese: 検査難民).[100][101][102][103] Some of these cases involved patients with severe pneumonia.[104] In reaction to this problem, the chairman of the Institute for Healthcare Governance Masahiro Kami claimed that many patients were refused to be tested due to their mild symptoms and criticized the Japanese government for setting testing standards that were too high and for lacking a response to patient anxiety.[105]
On 26 February, the Minister of Health Katsunobu stated in the National Diet that a total of 6,300 samples were tested between 18 and 24 February, averaging 900 samples per day. Some representatives questioned the discrepancy of the actual number of people tested and the claim in the prior week that 3,800 samples could be tested per day.[106]
South Korean media outlets have also compared the number of samples tested and the number of confirmed cases between Japan and South Korea, leading them to believe that there are more cases of the virus in Japan. This has led to speculations in South Korea that the decision not to increase the number of samples tested was influenced by the country's plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics.[107][108]
On the same day, more doctors reported that they were refused by the public health centres to test the patients. The Japan Medical Association announced that it would start a nationwide investigation and plan to cooperate with the government to improve the situation.[109] The Ministry of Health also stated that it would look into the situation with the local governments.[110]
According to an NHK News poll conducted from 6 to 9 March 2020, 6% of respondents strongly approved of the national government's response, while 43% somewhat approved, 34% somewhat disapproved and 13% strongly disapproved of the government response. Specifically, 69% viewed the closure of most schools as unavoidable, while 24% viewed the action as too drastic. Regarding the entry restrictions from China and South Korea, 36% strongly approved, 41% somewhat approved, 13% somewhat disapproved and 5% strongly disapproved.[111] On the other hand, the South Korean government criticized the Japanese government for restricting Koreans from entering the country to prevent the disease, saying, "unreasonable and excessive measures".[112][113]
Apart from individual quarantine measures, Japan does not have any laws that allow the government to restrict the movement of people in order to contain the virus. Compliance with government requests to restrict movements is based on "asking for public cooperation to ‘protect people’s lives’ and minimize further damage to [the economy]".[114]
Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said that "the new coronavirus is having a major impact on tourism, the economy and our society as a whole".[115][116] Face masks have sold out across the nation and stocks of face masks are depleted within a day of new arrivals.[117] There has been pressure placed on the healthcare system as demands for medical checkups increase.[118] Chinese people have reported increasing discrimination.[119] The health minister has pointed out that the situation has not reached a point where mass gatherings must be called off.[120]
Aviation, retail and tourism sectors have reported decreased sales and some manufacturers have complained about disruption to Chinese factories, logistics and supply chains.[121] Prime Minister Abe has considered using emergency funds to mitigate the outbreak's impact on tourism, of which Chinese nationals account for 40%.[122] S&P Global noted that the worst hit shares were from companies spanning travel, cosmetics and retail sectors which are most exposed to Chinese tourism.[123] Nintendo announced that they would delay shipment of the Nintendo Switch, which is manufactured in China, to Japan.[124]
On 28 February 2020, according to Oriental Land, a leisure and amusement company confirmed report, Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo DisneySea and Tokyo Disney Resort were temporarily closed from 29 February, at the start, they had been trying to plan to begin to operation in 15 march, however, with rescheduling operations to resume in early April.[125][126][127] The Comcast-owned Universal Studios Japan also announced a closure on the same day. The latter would also resume on 16 March.[128] Currently, Tokyo Disney Resort stated that they will remain closed by extending the temporary closure due to the coronavirus outbreak.[129]
The governor of Hokkaido, Naomichi Suzuki, declared a state of emergency due to the high number of new infections and asked citizens to stay at home that following weekend.[130]

The outbreak itself has been a concern for the 2020 Summer Olympics which is scheduled to take place in Tokyo starting at the end of July. The national government has thus been taking extra precautions to help minimise the outbreak's impact.[131][132] The Tokyo organising committee and the International Olympic Committee have been monitoring the outbreak's impact in Japan.[131]
Additionally, the outbreak has affected professional sports in Japan. Nippon Professional Baseball's preseason games and the Haru Basho sumo tournament in Osaka were announced to be held behind closed doors, while the J.League (soccer) and Top League (rugby) suspended or postponed play entirely.[133] Horseracing, Keirin, Kyotei and Auto race events remain on their usual schedule, but spectators cannot enter racecourse and cannot bet at offtrack betting. Customers can only bet over the internet and by telephone.[134]
On 26 February, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has suggested that major sporting, cultural and other events should be cancelled, delayed or scaled down for about two weeks amid the new coronavirus outbreak.[135]
On 28 February, Legoland Japan Resort was closed for three weeks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The park reopened on 23 March 2020 with short business hours, staff wearing masks, and temperature checks. Reopening was decided by confined space, density, and social distance.[137][138]
Affected by the shortage of outsourced staff due to the COVID-19 outbreak, many Japanese animated films and TV shows announced changes or postponed broadcasts due to production problems, including A Certain Scientific Railgun T (deferred for broadcast, changed to rebroadcast), Asteroid in Love, A3! (Delay extension), Kukuriraige -Sanxingdui Fantasy- (Delay extension), etc.[139][140]
On 25 March, The news that Japanese entertainment giant Ken Shimura has become infected is known all over Japan and around the world.[141][142] It was the day after Tokyo announced that a lockdown was also possible to prevent the medical collapse caused by the explosive spread of overflowing cluster.
On 26 January, Japanese people donated a batch of epidemic prevention masks and delivered them to Wuhan after Sichuan Airlines arrived in Chengdu.[143] According to "liberal digital times" of Taiwan, it believes that instead of donating from Japan, China bought from Japan,[144] but according to Japanese media reports and the Japanese Consulate General in Chongqing [ja] stated that it was a donation.[145][146]
On 3 February, four organizations, the Japan Pharmaceutical NPO Corporation, the Japan Hubei Federation, Huobi Global, and Incuba Alpha, donated materials to Hubei and wrote, "Is it clothesless? With the same clothes." (From "Book of Songs · Qin Feng · No Clothes") and "An Exotic Mountain and River, Same Wind and Moon".[147]
On 10 February, Liberal Democratic Party's Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai said at a press conference after the cadre meeting that the outbreak of coronavirus in mainland China has expanded, The Liberal Democratic Party will deduct 5,000 yen from the March funding of members of the party to provide mainland China with support funds.[148]
On 1 February, a 37-year-old man of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department working for the Cabinet Secretariat, which was responsible for the evacuation of citizens from Wuhan and other related matters, died at National Institute of Public Health in Saitama Prefecture. The institute was where some of the evacuees from Wuhan stayed under temporary quarantine. Police are investigating the man's cause of death, but they suspect he was suicidal.[149]

Italy's coronavirus deaths slow, offering glimmer of hope
ROME (Reuters) - The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy rose by 602 on Monday, the smallest increase for four days, while the number of new cases also slowed, raising hope that the most aggressive phase of the epidemic may be passing.

The Civil Protection Agency said the number of fatalities from the month-old contagion stood at 6,077, while confirmed cases totaled 63,927, an increase of 4,789 over the past 24 hours — the smallest rise for five days.
“Today is perhaps the first positive day we have had in this hard, very tough month,” said Giulio Gallera, the top health official in the northern region of Lombardy, which has been hardest hit by the outbreak.
Coronavirus death toll in Italy's Lombardy rises by around 320 in a day: source
However, there was also a significant fall in the number of tests carried out, and the head of Italy’s national health institute, Silvio Brusaferro, said it was too soon to say if the recent decline in daily deaths and new cases would continue.
Unions in Lombardy earlier announced they would strike on Wednesday to protect the health of their workers, saying a government decree temporarily shutting businesses due to the coronavirus emergency contained too many loopholes.
Italy has suffered the world’s deadliest outbreak of the respiratory pandemic, with 62% of the fatalities registered in Lombardy, the country’s most populous and wealthy region.
In a joint statement, they trio of unions said workers in all factories not directly linked to the beleaguered health sector would down tools. Lombardy’s chemical workers said they would also stay home on March 25.
Many of the country’s most prominent companies have already suspended their output in Italy, including eyeware manufacturer Luxottica, luxury carmaker Ferrari and tyre maker Pirelli. The Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler told employees on Monday it would halt production in all European and North American plants and help with the production of masks during the coronavirus emergency, a union representative said.
Italy’s northern regions have borne the overwhelming brunt of the crisis but there is concern the virus could spread into the poorer south where health systems are less well-equipped.
The first death was recorded on Monday in the southern region of Basilicata, meaning all Italy’s 20 regions have now registered fatalities.

ATHENS, March 18 (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee is facing its strongest headwinds in decades as it prepares to brief national committees on Wednesday on the state of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics amid the coronavirus pandemic, with voices of dissent growing louder.
The IOC has remained committed to staging the Tokyo Games as planned from July 24-Aug. 9, saying on Tuesday after a meeting with international sports federations that measures against the virus were delivering results.
The coronavirus has so far killed more than 7,500 people and infected about 200,000, with the epicentre now in Europe.
The virus has also wreaked havoc with Olympic qualification tournaments with athletes struggling to train, travel or compete and many pre-Games qualifiers cancelled or postponed.
“The IOC is committed to finding a solution with the least negative impact for the athletes, while protecting the integrity of the competition and the athletes’ health.
Wickenheiser, who competed in five Winter Games in ice hockey and at the 2000 Summer Olympics in softball, said continuing with the Games as planned ignored the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Several athletes, including reigning Olympic pole vault champion Katerina Stefanidi, said the IOC decision was putting athletes’ health at risk, urging them to train as normal when entire countries have shut down to contain the virus spread.

United States could become coronavirus epicenter: WHO
GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States has the potential to become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic due to a “very large acceleration” in infections there, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday.

The highly contagious respiratory virus has infected more than 42,000 people in the United States, prompting more governors to join states ordering Americans to stay at home.
“...They (the United States) have a very large outbreak and an outbreak that is increasing in intensity,” Harris added.
However, she identified some positive signs such as more comprehensive testing, and further efforts to isolate the sick and trace their immediate contacts exposed to the virus.
Overall, the global outbreak was accelerating very rapidly and she expected large increases in case numbers and deaths from the 334,981 cases and 14,652 deaths currently reported to WHO.
WHO’s dashboard on its website, which tends to lag countries’ individual tallies, showed that Monday had by far the biggest daily rise in infections since the outbreak began in December, with more than 40,000 new cases.
Up until now, Europe has been the center of transmission with Italy the most badly-hit country with the world’s highest number of deaths, although fatalities have begun slowing there.
Asked about a potential tipping point in Italy, she said: “There is a glimmer of hope there. We’ve seen in the last two days fewer new cases and deaths in Italy but it’s very, very early days yet.”
Harris also voiced concern about growing case numbers in countries with weak health systems and high HIV prevalence.
South Africa’s confirmed number of coronavirus cases rose to 554 on Tuesday ahead of a nationwide lockdown panned for 21 days from midnight on Thursday.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran has temporarily freed about 85,000 people from jail, including political prisoners, in response to the coronavirus epidemic, a judiciary spokesman said on Tuesday.
Iran has reported 16,169 coronavirus cases and 988 deaths from the virus in one of the worst national outbreaks outside China, where the pandemic originated.
“So far, some 85,000 prisoners have been released ... Also in the jails we have taken precautionary measures to confront the outbreak,” judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said.
Iran's death toll from coronavirus climbs to 988: health official
Iran announced the release of 70,000 prisoners on March 9 in response to the virus, but none were political detainees.
The U.N. Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran, Javaid Rehman, said then that he had asked Tehran to free all political prisoners temporarily from the country’s overcrowded and disease-ridden jails to help contain the spread of the virus.
Rehman said only those serving sentences of less than five years had been freed, while prisoners charged with heavier sentences and those linked to participation in anti-government protests remained in jail.
Before the March 9 release, Iran said it had 189,500 people in prison, according to a report Rehman submitted to the Human Rights Council in January. They are believed to include hundreds arrested during or after anti-government protests in November.
The United States has urged Iran to free dozens of dual nationals and foreigners held mainly on spying charges, saying Washington would hold the Tehran government directly responsible for any American deaths.
Many Iranians have ignored calls by the health authorities to stay at home, and shops and restaurants are open. Iran’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has issued a religious ruling prohibiting ‘unnecessary’ trips.
“Stay at home ... Shopping for the new year is like committing suicide these days,” a health ministry official told the state television, which said millions of Iranians could die of the virus if people traveled for the new year holidays.
Officials have blamed U.S. sanctions, reimposed on Tehran since Washington quit Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with six powers, for hampering Tehran’s fight against the coronavirus.
Tehran has urged other countries to back its call for a lifting of U.S. sanctions because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Last week, Iran said it had asked the International Monetary Fund for $5 billion in emergency funding to combat the outbreak. To mitigate economic pressure on Iranians, the government has ordered delays in business tax and loan repayments until May.

South Korea reports more recoveries than coronavirus cases for the first time
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea reported more recoveries from the coronavirus than new infections on Friday for the first time since its outbreak emerged in January, as a downward trend in daily cases raised hopes that Asia’s biggest epidemic outside China may be slowing.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) recorded 110 new coronavirus cases on Friday compared with 114 a day earlier, taking the national tally to 7,979. The death toll rose by five to 72 as of late Friday.
In contrast, 177 patients were released from hospitals where they had been isolated for treatment, the KCDC said.
The latest figures are in line with a downward trend in new cases which has raised hopes that the outbreak may be easing in Asia’s fourth-largest economy.
The trend is expected to persist, with more self-quarantined patients being discharged in the coming days, KCDC chief Jeong Eun-kyeong said.
Of the latest 110 cases, 61 were from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu where a fringe Christian church at the center of the epidemic is located, while 17 and 13 were in Sejong and Seoul, respectively.
At least 109 cases so far have been linked to the call center, operated by an insurance company whose 800-strong workforce is being tested or in quarantine for monitoring. But the rate of increase in new infections has been slowing over the past couple of days.
Seoul city said it plans to carry out extensive checks on some 10,500 computer cafes and karaoke bars as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the virus in crowded workplaces.
Global alarm over the coronavirus intensified, with governments from Europe to the United States unveiling new measures aimed at slowing the spread of a disease that has infected almost 135,000 people worldwide.
South Korea said it will subject visitors from France, Germany, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands to reinforced border checks starting Sunday, after imposing similar rules for China, Italy and Iran suffering a major outbreak.

Vietnam quarantines tens of thousands in camps amid vigorous attack on coronavirus
HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has sent tens of thousands of people to quarantine camps as waves of overseas citizens return home to escape a coronavirus pandemic spreading in Europe and the United States.

Even though Vietnam is one of Southeast Asia’s poorer nations, its efforts against the virus, praised at home, have ensured its tally of infections is lower than those of many neighbours.
By Thursday, those quarantined numbered 44,955, including nearly half in military-run centres, down about 15% from Monday’s figure, official data showed, as many among the first influx to return home early in March were discharged.
“All passengers undergo quick screening,” a medical official at Hanoi’s Noi Bai airport told Reuters.
Vietnam to limit gatherings to 20 people to curb coronavirus spread
“Those with symptoms are taken to hospital, and the rest are sent to quarantine camps, where they will share a room with 10 to 20 others on the same flight.”
Vietnam has reported just 148 infections, its health ministry says, with no deaths. Its proven infection rate is lower than any regional nations except Myanmar and Laos, where testing has been limited.
The current phase of the battle against the virus is “decisive”, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has said, in an effort government statements describe as the “spring general offensive of 2020”.
Vietnam took a textbook approach in its early response strategy, based on its experience as the first country outside China to be hit by the SARS outbreak of 2003, said Todd Pollack, an infectious diseases specialist at Harvard Medical School.
“Quarantine of individuals who have contact with a case or are coming from a high risk area is definitely a key strategy; especially since people infected seem to be infectious at the very start of symptoms,” added Pollack, who works with a Harvard initiative in Hanoi, Health Advancement in Vietnam (HAIVN).
Vietnam began its mass quarantine programme on Mar. 16, when it began compulsory testing and quarantine measures for arrivals from virus-hit areas.
Vietnam’s aggressive contact tracing has occasionally led to the quarantine or self-isolation of hundreds of people because of just a few cases.
People have been cheered by tales on social media of tired soldiers offering help or sleeping in the forest to provide bed space for arrivals at military-run quarantine centres.
“Quarantine camp can’t be like home,” said Nguyen Ha My, a student who was sent to a barracks 160 km (100 miles) outside Hanoi after she arrived from Hungary on Saturday.
My and others in quarantine said everyone practised social distancing, with those showing initial symptoms immediately moved elsewhere in the camp.
“It’s like a vacation, at quarantine camp,” Anh told Reuters. “Free Wi-Fi, free meals, free face masks. Just a little heart attack if any of the roommates cough.”

Pakistan Links Some of Its 21 Coronavirus Cases to Syria
A health official of an emergency rescue service checks the body temperature of a government employee in Peshawar, Pakistan, March 12, 2020.
ISLAMABAD - Officials in Pakistan Thursday said the number of coronavirus cases in the country has risen to 21, noting that eight of them were imported from Syria.
The World Health Organization has declared the global outbreak a pandemic.  
State Minister of Health Zafar Mirza said all of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 are related to outbreaks in countries such as Syria, Iran, Iraq and China.“
A majority of the infections are in their initial stages, and we are hopeful the patients will recover from the disease,” he said.  
Mirza noted that there have been no local transmissions of the virus in Pakistan, saying federal authorities, together with provincial governments, are taking all possible measures to prevent it from spreading.
Pakistani officials said 14 of the coronavirus cases, including those linked to Syria, arrived in Karachi, the capital of Sindh province and the country’s largest city.  
A provincial government spokesman said Thursday that two of the patients have recovered, while the rest remain under observation in isolation wards.
Murtaza Wahab, an adviser to the chief minister, also announced that the remaining matches of an ongoing national cricket competition, which involved international players, will now take place in Karachi without spectators to prevent the spread of the virus. Education institutions in Sindh have already been closed.  
Syria denies virus presence
For their part, Syrian officials have reportedly denied the presence of the coronavirus in the country, saying several dozen suspected cases have tested negative.  “
There are no coronavirus cases in Syria so far,” Health Minister Nizar Yaziji reportedly told Syrian media on Tuesday.
Pakistan has closed its border with neighboring Iran, and air links remain suspended with Iran, one of the worst hit by the virus across the globe. Iranian officials reported Thursday the nationwide death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 429, while the number of infected people surpassed 10,000.  
Pakistan has also closed its overland border with China and cut air links to the country known as the epicenter of the coronavirus, where the first case was detected in December before the infection surfaced in other nations.
Islamabad has also shut a major southwestern border crossing with Afghanistan. Afghan officials have confirmed seven cases of the coronavirus, linking them to the Iranian outbreak.
Punjab declares emergency  
On Thursday, the most populous Pakistani province of Punjab declared a medical emergency across the region, saying the precautionary step was related to the coronavirus outbreak. No confirmed cases have been detected in the province.
Provincial Health Minister Yasmin Rashid told reporters in the capital of Lahore that the government has also stepped up vigilance at international airports in Punjab.
The Maryland-based Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the virus using data compiled by the World Health Organization and U.S. and Chinese national health organizations, says more than 127,000 people worldwide were infected by COVID-19 as of Thursday. More than 4,700 of them died, while approximately 68,000 have recovered.

Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump described the US response to the covid-19 outbreak as “a tremendous success” and asserted that the risk to Americans was “very low”. Following his speech, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported apparent local transmission of covid-19 to a person in northern California with no relevant travel history or exposure to a known infected patient.
26 February - Iran’s government said it had no plans to quarantine any cities or towns despite coid-19 spreading across the country. Meanwhile in Italy confirmed cases leapt by 45% to reach 322, and four more deaths were confirmed amid signs that the infection was spreading around the country and across borders. New cases in Italy were reported in central Tuscany, the coastal region of Liguria, and Sicily in the south. Officials confirmed that the national death toll was now 11.
25 February - UK government tells people who have returned home from one of the quarantined areas in Italy to self-isolate. Meanwhile, those who had travelled in any other areas north of Pisa were told to stay at home for 14 days if they develop flu-like symptoms. This came as children who returned from holidays in northern Italy were sent home from school and four schools in England were closed for deep cleaning.
23 February - Italy began implementing a strict quarantine across towns in the north, as cases in the country rapidly increased.
17 February - The China National Health Commission reported a total of 72 436 confirmed cases of the virus and 1868 deaths in the country. They said over 12 500 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, while around 58 000 confirmed cases (including 11 741 in serious condition) and 6242 suspected cases remained.

14 February - First case of covid-19 confirmed in Africa (Egypt).
13 February - BMA tells NHS England that general practices should be able to turn off their online booking systems in response to the covid-19 outbreak, without fear of repercussions over breaching their contract. They warned that online systems do not triage patients in the same way that a receptionist does, which could lead to potential cases turning up at the practice and putting patients and staff at risk.
11 February - The number of confirmed cases in China hit 42 708 and the number of deaths surpassed 1000. Outside of China, 393 cases and one death were reported. In the UK, a GP practice in Brighton closed after two GPs were found to have the virus. WHO announced the virus would be known as COVID-19. Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, "Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising."
10 February - UK government declared that novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health. Meanwhile, the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London estimated that for all cases of the virus, the case fatality ratio is around 1%.
7 February - Li Wenliang - a doctor from Wuhan, China, who said he was reprimanded by police for warning other doctors about novel coronavirus at the start of the outbreak - died after being infected with 2019-nCoV.
6 February - Third novel coronavirus case confirmed in the UK. Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England said, “The individual did not acquire this in the UK. The patient is being transferred to a specialist NHS centre, and we are using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus. The NHS is well prepared to manage these cases and we are now working quickly to identify any contacts the patient has had.” WHO then warned that the global demand for personal protective equipment such as masks and respirators was 100 times the normal level, and costs had skyrocketed to around 20 times the usual price. It said worldwide stocks were “insufficient” to meet demand and called on manufacturers to only sell equipment to healthcare professionals.
5 February - Thousands of passengers on a cruise ship, stopped in Yokohama, Japan, are quarantined for two weeks after 10 people on board were found to be infected with the novel coronavirus. Meanwhile, GPs in some areas of Australia raised concerns over a lack of appropriate personal protective gear, including face masks, for themselves and their staff. The gear is needed as part of the coronavirus response. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners said the recent bushfires had led to face mask shortages, but that the government would distribute its emergency medical stockpile.
4 February - First case of novel coronavirus confirmed in Belgium. The person was thought to be one of citizens evacuated from Wuhan, China
3 February - Total reported cases rose to 17 488, with 362 deaths. However, China reported that 475 people had recovered.

In the UK, the government announced £20m in research funding for the development of new vaccines for coronavirus and other infectious diseases.
2 February - The first death from novel coronavirus was reported outside of China, in man from Wuhan who was believed to have been infected before arriving in the Philippines. Meanwhile, thousands of hospital workers in Hong Kong voted to strike in order to pressure the government to fully close the borders with mainland China.

30 January - The World Health Organisation declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern over the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It reported that the virus had spread to 18 countries, and that human to human transmission had occurred in four - Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the US. It said the declaration was "not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries. Our greatest concern is for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems that are ill prepared to deal with it.”
29 January - The UK government has announced plans to fly hundreds of British citizens back from Wuhan and quarantine them for two weeks. The move comes after British Airways suspended all flights to and from mainland China until at least 31 January. Other countries, including Australia, Japan, the US have also started to repatriate citizens.

Of the 1975 confirmed cases in mainland China, 324 cases have been reported as severely ill.
25 January - Updated report from the MRC centre at Imperial College London estimated that up to 18 January, the R0 was 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5), meaning that, on average, each case infected 2.6 other people. It said control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. It added that in the absence of antiviral drugs or vaccines, “control relies upon the prompt detection and isolation of symptomatic cases.”
24 January - 830 cases and 26 deaths confirmed worldwide.
23 January - 14 people in the UK are tested for the virus, however all are found to be negative. Chinese authorities put Wuhan in lockdown and expanded travel restrictions to several nearby cities. The WHO also met to examine the situation but decided against announcing a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). It also estimated that the preliminary R0 (reproduction number) estimate is 1.4 to 2.5, meaning that every person infected could infect between 1.4 and 2.5 people.
22 January - The UK began sending health teams to meet each direct flight aircraft from Wuhan, China, to check for symptoms of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and to provide information in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese to all passengers about symptoms and what to do if they become ill. However, China then announced it would be shutting down transportation from Wuhan.
21 January - The first US case was reported in a man who travelled from Wuhan to Washington State. Meanwhile, a man who returned from China to Australia with respiratory symptoms was tested, but was found not to have the virus.
20 January - Researchers at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London estimated that a total of 4000 people in Wuhan City had an onset of symptoms caused by the novel disease (uncertainty range: 1,000 – 9,700) by 18th January 2020.
20 January - Chinese authorities confirmed evidence of human to human transmission, after the virus spread to 14 health workers in China. South Korea announced its first confirmed case, in a 35 year old Chinese woman who flew from Wuhan to Incheon international airport.
15 January - Japan announced that a man in his 30s who had been to Wuhan tested positive for the virus on his return to Japan. He recovered and was discharged from hospital five days later.
13 January - Thailand reported a 61 year old woman had tested positive for the virus, despite not having visited the seafood market where the outbreak is thought to have originated.
11/12 January 2020 - China told The WHO the outbreak was associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan City. Chinese authorities then identified the mystery disease as a new type of coronavirus, and shared its genetic sequence for countries to use in developing specific diagnostic kits.
31 December 2019 - The first reports of the coronavirus - known then as pneumonia with unknown cause - came from Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China.
Sharing research data and findings relevant to the novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (2019-nCoV) represents a significant and urgent threat to global health.
We call on researchers, journals and funders to ensure that research findings and data relevant to this outbreak are shared rapidly and openly to inform the public health response and help save lives.
We affirm the commitment to the principles set out in the 2016 Statement on data sharing in public health emergencies, and will seek to ensure that the World Health Organization has rapid access to emerging findings that could aid the global response.
• all peer-reviewed research publications relevant to the outbreak are made immediately open access, or freely available at least for the duration of the outbreak
• research findings relevant to the outbreak are shared immediately with the WHO upon journal submission, by the journal and with author knowledge
• researchers share interim and final research data relating to the outbreak, together with protocols and standards used to collect the data, as rapidly and widely as possible - including with public health and research communities and the WHO
We intend to apply the principles of this statement to similar outbreaks in the future where there is a significant public health benefit to ensuring data is shared widely and rapidly.

New Jersey's measures dealing with coronavirus are "as aggressive" as any other state, Gov. Phil Murphy said Sunday.
The governor responded to questions about the quarantine of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut that President Trump was considering on Saturday. Trump later ruled that out in favor of an advisory urging residents of the states to "refrain from nonessential domestic travel" for 14 days.

Animal shelters pull out the stops to find pets homes during coronavirus outbreak
Animal shelters using innovative strategies amid COVID-19 concerns
For fear of a surge in homeless animals due to coronavirus, shelters are thinking outside the box to place pets in new homes.

But as coronavirus continues to spread and shut down large parts of the country, animal experts fear that the nation will see an uptick in surrendered animals. If left unaddressed, shelters across the United States could be at risk of severe overcrowding.
“This is an issue all the time, but it becomes more acute during COVID-19,” said Kitty Block, the CEO and president of the Humane Society of the United States. “If people financially are running into difficulties caring for their animal, they’ll get surrendered to shelters. Or, if there are family members that become ill and can’t take care of their dog or cat or the pets they have in their home.”
Martin cautioned, however, that her team still has plenty of work to do because they are restricted as to what animals they can take in. Due to coronavirus, she said they are unable to take cats or surrendered dogs, and can only accept stray dogs, which coincides with the Arizona state mandate.
RELATED: Coronavirus outbreak may cause more adoptable pets to be euthanized, animal advocates say
“For many people who are working remotely from home for the first time, the isolation may be difficult to adjust to. Having a pet for company can help make you happier, more comfortable and even more productive,” she noted.
Like Martin and Block, Castle believes that there is still more to be done. Her prediction is that if COVID-19 continues to hamper the economy, the need to place animals will continue to grow. That's why her team will continue to find innovative ways to place pets and offset the demand as well.
"Unfortunately, we're already seeing the early signs of the economic ramifications around COVID-19, such as people losing their jobs or housing and having urgent surrender needs," said Castle. "We are projecting that this is probably the bigger, longer-term threat."

2020 Detroit Auto Show canceled due to coronavirus crisis
The 2020 North American International Auto Show scheduled for June has been canceled after the TCF center where the annual show is held was selected as a site for coronavirus relief efforts.
Due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in the state, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was assessing several possible sites that could be used to place patients overflowing from hospitals nearing capacity.
First reported by the Detroit Free Press Saturday afternoon, the major event's cancellation is only the latest casualty in a long list of sporting events, policy meetings and school schedules disrupted by COVID-19.
THE BEST WAY TO KILL CORONAVIRUS IN CARS
"We fully support NAIAS organizers in their postponement. The health and safety of our community and those working throughout the industry is our top priority. We look forward to seeing the show’s return in 2021," said a company spokesperson.
Backed by financial assistance from FEMA, the Army Corps had assessed dozens of locations throughout the state as health officials prepped for another brutal week of confirmed coronavirus. Detroit has become the unofficial epicenter of the state's outbreak after confirming 1,377 of Michigan's total cases and 30 deaths.
Prior to the NAIAS cancellation, several other international car shows in Switzerland and China also had been postponed due to the coronavirus.

The number of U.S. deaths from coronavirus topped 2,000 on Saturday – just days after reaching the 1,000 mark.
The rising number signaled the rapid spread of the virus, also known as COVID-19, despite extraordinary public health measures in place across the nation that have closed businesses – grinding the economy to a near-halt -- and confined millions to their homes.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT DR. AMESH ADALJA URGES SMALLER COMMUNITIES TO PREPARE FOR CORONAVIRUS WAVE
Globally, Italy saw nearly 1,000 more deaths Saturday -- topping China in both cases and deaths -- and the Netherlands cracked into the top 10 in confirmed cases. The worldwide case total rose to nearly 650,000 and death toll topped 30,000.
New York continued to lead the U.S. in both confirmed cases and fatalities, with more than 52,000 people infected and more than 700 dead.
On Wednesday night, when the U.S. reached 1,000 deaths, New York had about 20,000 confirmed cases and 280 deaths.
In Michigan, the state’s Department of Health and Human Services reported a jump in confirmed cases of nearly 1,000 on Saturday and the addition of 19 deaths – bringing the state’s totals to 4,650 cases and 111 deaths, Detroit’s FOX 2 reported.
In Illinois, the number of cases rose to nearly 3,500 and the number of deaths to 47 – including one baby, according to Chicago’s FOX 32.
Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker says an infant with COVID-19 has died, investigation underway to determine the cause of death.

Louisiana had 3,315 cases of COV-19 and 137 deaths as of Saturday afternoon, FOX 8 reported.
Hoping to contain the spread to the most severely affected areas, President Trump on Saturday said he was considering a mandatory quarantine for the New York City area, including the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Trump ultimately decided against the plan, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel advisory for the area.

As more and more people are practicing social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic, animal shelters and rescue centers have had to close their doors to visitors. Fortunately, some companies are taking steps to ensure that needy dogs don’t get forgotten about during the outbreak.
Animal shelters across the US are making the hard decision to close their doors to the public because of the coronavirus pandemic. As more people are staying home, shelters and human societies are trying to place as many animals as quickly as possible. 
“During these uncertain and lonelier times, people need an escape: cue the cute puppy memes and photos,” a spokesperson for Busch in a statement to People. “But as much as we need those cute puppy pics to help get us through social distancing, it’s actually them who need us.”

President Trump on Saturday night said the administration would not be issuing a quarantine on New York, parts of New Jersey and some of Connecticut as part of the efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
"A quarantine will not be necessary," he tweeted, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would issue a "travel advisory" later in the evening.
"Due to extensive community transmission of COVID -19 in the area, CDC urges residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately," it said, noting that the advisory doesn't apply to  "employees of critical infrastructure industries, including but not limited to trucking, public health professionals, financial services, and food supply."

The move would be a dramatic escalation of the efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus, and comes on the back of those states essentially shuttering daily life -- closing schools, businesses, leisure activities and urging residents to stay at home.
Cuomo, who was holding a press conference at the same time as when Trump made his remarks to the press, expressed confusion at Trump's proposal -- saying he had spoken to him about a hospital ship and opening up emergency medical sites, but not a statewide quarantine.
"I don't even know what that means. I don't know how that could be legally enforceable and from a medical point of view I don't know what you would be accomplishing," he said. "But I can tell you I don't even like the sound of it, not even understanding what it is I don't like the sound of it."
Trump has expressed the desire to re-open the country and get the U.S. back on a normal footing after weeks of measures to stop the virus, but has also noted that there are “hotspots” that have particularly large cases of the virus.

A U.S. Army Ranger veteran and entrepreneur teamed up with a country music star and a bunch of their friends to create and perform a new song promoting safe habits during the coronavirus outbreak.
"We have so much organic traffic on our social media," said Best on "Fox and Friends" on Friday, "so we thought that it would be a great idea to promote the quarantine, social distancing, stop the spread of the disease and also raise awareness for our medical professionals."
"Right now is the time to unite together, support the people fighting the disease and then stop the spread of it," he said.
Best and Montana have close family members in the medical field, and they encouraged Americans to do what they can to support health care professionals.
"Having such close family in the medical world that is what they are advising us," added Best, reiterating advice that Americans self-isolate.
"Stay home, social distancing and then any way that we can a provide whether it is coffee or support to [health care professionals] because they are putting in the long, long hours — that's what we are going to do."
Fox Nation's Abby Hornacek investigated the issue and donated blood herself, demonstrating that people can be confident in their own safety, and adherence to appropriate "social distancing" measures, while giving blood.

When Abby Hornacek was not raising awareness over a severe shortage of blood donations amid the coronavirus outbreak, she was challenging her dad, former NBA player and coach, Jeff Hornacek to a high-stakes version of ping-pong that one must see to believe.
In Fox Nation's new series "Tales of Social Distancing," hosts Hornacek, Kacie McDonnell and Tomi Lahren bring Fox Nation viewers inside their homes to share their experiences during the coronavirus outbreak.
"I wanted them to know how much we appreciate them -- that they are out there risking their health, so we can get the groceries and the supplies that we need," said Lahren.

CDC issues travel advisory for three states as global COVID-19 death toll tops 30,000
Globally, the number of cases has now surpassed 665,000, with the U.S. leading the way at 124,686 cases.
'Don't give an order you can't enforce': Lt. Gen. Russel Honor? on coronavirus
People in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have been urged to "refrain from non-essential domestic travel" for the next two weeks by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the number of people killed by the coronavirus pandemic around the world surpassed 30,000.
The CDC travel advisory was issued after President Donald Trump decided against calling for a quarantine in the tri-state area which have been hard hit by the epidemic. State officials had questioned whether he had the authority to implement a lockdown and accused the president of creating confusion.
Globally, the number of cases is now at nearly 680,000, with the U.S. leading the way at 124,686 cases, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University (JHU) showed. Coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. have doubled in just two days, surpassing 2,000 on Saturday, according to an NBC News tally.
Almost half of them have come in New York State alone, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday that 728 people had died from COVID-19, adding that more than 52,000 people had tested positive for the disease.
Earlier Saturday Trump sparked confusion when he told reporters as he was leaving the White House for Norfolk, Va., that he was considering an “enforceable quarantine” in the tri-state area because he was concerned New Yorkers were traveling to places like Florida and spreading the virus.
Italy has the highest death toll, with a total of 10,023 reported since the outbreak began, JHU data showed.
Italian officials said 889 more people died between Saturday and Sunday and nearly 6,000 new cases were reported, bringing the total number of infected in the country to 92,472.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said late Saturday he had approved a new package of economic measures to help those worst hit by the epidemic. Shopping vouchers and food packages would be provided to the vulnerable, he said.

In a televised address Saturday evening, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez extended the nationwide lockdown by two weeks until at least April 9.
Sanchez added that Spain has now acquired 659 million face masks, as the number of cases rose to 72,248.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for China's National Health Commission (NHC) said Sunday the country is now dealing with 639 imported cases, raising the possibility of a new round of infections after domestic cases tapered off.
Numbers released by the NHC revealed that 44 of the 45 new confirmed cases have come from abroad. No new confirmed cases have emerged from Wuhan, where the outbreak is believed to have originated late last year, as the city reopened its subway and long-distance train service Sunday.

Coronavirus map: The COVID-19 virus is spreading across the world. Here's where cases have been confirmed.
More than 640,000 have been sickened by the coronavirus around the world. This map is updated daily.
Health officials worldwide are working to contain cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that originated in China.
This map will be updated when more information is available. As of March 29, COVID-19 cases were confirmed in more than 190 countries and territories.
More than 640,000 people have been sickened and more than 30,000 have died of the coronavirus since the start of January, according to NBC News reports, the World Health Organization (WHO) and figures from state government leaders and health officials. More than 74,000 people have recovered.
While most of the cases have occurred in mainland China, the number of new cases in China are tapering off as the number of new cases in the rest of the world continues to rise. The chair of the WHO emergency committee said on January 23 that it was "too early" to call the coronavirus an emergency, and on January 30 on the organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency. On March 11, WHO labeled the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and on March 13 President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in the United States.

The Chinese government, which is looking to avoid a repeat of the 2003 SARS outbreak, warned officials not to cover up the spread of the virus. The South China Morning Post reported that Beijing said anyone who withheld information would be “the sinner of a millennium to the party and the people” and would be “nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity.”

Social distancing halved rate of spread in Australia, PM says as lockdown measures increase
The rate of spread of the novel coronavirus in Australia has halved in recent days, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday as he announced an additional 1.1 billion Australian dollars (about $680 million) to expand telemedicine care and other health services.
The daily increase in cases in recent days was at about 13 percent-15 percent, down from 25 percent-30 percent seen a week ago, showing social distancing measures were working, Morrison said. He acknowledged, however, that these were still strong rates of increase.
As such, Morrison said that public gatherings should not exceed two people, and stressed Australians should go out only when necessary. There are nearly 4,000 confirmed cases in Australia on Sunday and 16 deaths, health officials said.
Also on Sunday, neighboring New Zealand saw its first death related to the virus, with cases rising to 514 confirmed infections.

Questions as British PM and Prince Charles get tests while doctors do not
When it emerged this week that Britain’s prime minister, health secretary and heir to the throne had all tested positive for the coronavirus after presenting mild symptoms, there were, mixed among the supportive messages wishing them speedy recoveries, other social media posts that posed uncomfortable questions.
“How did you get tested when thousands can't?” one Twitter user asked in response to the news Friday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive for the coronavirus and was self-isolating in London.
“Where did the test kits for Prince Charles and Boris Johnson come from?” another asked, pointing out that medical workers with Britain's beloved National Health Service were struggling to get tested.
FDA authorizes emergency use of 15-minute coronavirus test
FDA approves new coronavirus test, with results in as fast as 10 minutes
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of a new, rapid coronavirus test that could give patients results in less than 15 minutes.
Abbott, the medical device company that created the test, said Friday it can deliver "results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes."
Other approved tests are able to provide results within hours or days.
The company said it is ramping up production to deliver 50,000 tests to the U.S. health care system starting next week.
The enforcement actions come after Gov. Gina Raimondo ordered that anyone who has moved from New York state to Rhode Island in the past two weeks must self-quarantine for 14 days, part of her state's effort to slow the spread of coronavirus.
Troops from the National Guard have been posted at train stations and bus depots to inform New Yorkers of the order, and on Saturday they began going door-to-door to tell any recent travelers from New York that they must follow the quarantine to stop the spread of the coronavirus. State police began stopping cars with New York plates on Friday.

Spanish doctor warns situation in hospitals likely to become 'unsustainable'
A doctor in Spain has warned that unless the number of new coronavirus infections decreases, the situation in Madrid's hospitals will be "almost unsustainable" in a few days. 
"One of the worst shifts I can remember," Miguel Guirao, 27, a Spanish anesthesiologist, wrote on Twitter, posting a photo of his face marked with red lines from his protective mask after a 19-hour shift. "And they said it was like the flu."
Guirao told NBC News that staff at the Hospital Universitario La Paz where he works have "literally just enough" personal protective equipment, but not enough ventilators for patients.
Doctors need to decide which patients can be admitted to their critical care units, taking into account medical history and prognosis. "There is even an age limit: Above it, you do not enter, because there isn't a bed for everyone," explained Guirao. 
Madrid has been the city worst affected by the pandemic in Spain, with a total of 10,575 cases and 1,263 deaths reported in the capital so far, according to officials on Tuesday.

The rate of spread of the novel coronavirus in Australia has halved in recent days, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday as he announced an additional 1.1 billion Australian dollars (about $680 million) to expand telemedicine care and other health services.
The daily increase in cases in recent days was at about 13 percent-15 percent, down from 25 percent-30 percent seen a week ago, showing social distancing measures were working, Morrison said. He acknowledged, however, that these were still strong rates of increase.
As such, Morrison said that public gatherings should not exceed two people, and stressed Australians should go out only when necessary. There are nearly 4,000 confirmed cases in Australia on Sunday and 16 deaths, health officials said.
Also on Sunday, neighboring New Zealand saw its first death related to the virus, with cases rising to 514 confirmed infections.
Spain reports record daily death toll as lockdown is extended

Spain has reached a daily record for virus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours, according to the country's Ministry of Health. This brings the total number to 6,528, the world’s second-highest country behind Italy.
Sunday’s number is slightly up from Saturday when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus. The number of confirmed infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to 78,797 cases on Sunday, the Ministry of Health said.  
Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said in a press conference on Saturday that all non-essential workers in Spain are ordered to stay home for two additional weeks of lockdown from Monday until April 9. He added that workers will receive their usual salaries but would have to make up lost hours at a later date.
Sánchez also said the Spanish Ministry of Health has bought healthcare supplies from China, including 659 million face masks. He called the outbreak, “the worst crisis in Europe since World War II.”

India's prime minister apologizes as lockdown criticism mounts
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the nation’s poor for forgiveness on Sunday, as the economic and human toll from his 21-day nationwide lockdown deepens and criticism mounts about a lack of adequate planning ahead of the decision.

Modi on Tuesday announced a three week-lockdown to curb the spread of the virus that has particularly stung millions of India’s poor, leaving many hungry and forcing tens of thousands of jobless migrant laborers to walk hundreds of kilometers from cities back to their native villages.

The global death toll from COVID-19 has surpassed 30,000, according to John Hopkins University, as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel advisory for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where the coronavirus outbreak has hit the U.S. hardest.
Elsewhere, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote residents urging them to stay home during the country's weeks-long lockdown. Johnson, who recently tested positive for coronavirus, said "things will get worse before they get better." The U.K. has surpassed 1,000 known deaths.

China’s National Health Commission spokesperson Mi Feng said in a briefing that on March 28 the number of confirmed cases had dropped to less than 3,000, and the spread of the local coronavirus cases had been basically blocked.
A total of 693 overseas imported confirmed cases from 42 countries have been reported, of which seven countries have a larger number of cases than China, accounted for 83.4% of the total. Officials warned these imported cases are still likely to cause a new round of spread within China.
Officials previously claimed on March 23 to have mostly halted domestic cases. The National Health Commission reiterated this on March 29 as China's existing confirmed cases dropped to a new low, but warned the country should stay on high alert.
Coronavirus could kill over 100,000 Americans, White House expert warns
Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that he anticipates the coronavirus could kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans while infecting "millions."
Speaking with CNN's "State of the Union," the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said however he does not want to be "held" to that prediction because the COVID-19 outbreak is "such a moving target."
'Like sitting ducks': Amid coronavirus, families, attorney sound alarm over ICE detainees
Americans with family members in immigration detention facilities, as well as their lawyers, are sounding the alarm and urging the release of non-violent detainees with underlying health conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 24, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a person held in an immigrant detention center.
“This is what public health experts have assured us would happen: People in detention centers are sitting ducks for the spread of this virus. The same experts have also predicted that once outbreaks in detention centers begin, they will spread rapidly,” Andrea Flores, deputy director of policy at the ACLU said in a statement.
VA opens its hospital beds to non-veterans to assist New York City
The Department of Veterans Affairs said Sunday that it would be opening up 50 beds in two of its hospitals to help New York City in its efforts to combat the coronavirus. 
Non-veteran patients who need treatment for ailments other than COVID-19, the disease associated with the virus, will be eligible for 35 acute care and 15 intensive care unit hospital beds. The transfer of five non-COVID patients from community hospitals to VA campuses in Manhattan and Brooklyn is already underway, the department said. 
WASHINGTON — Two governors of states seeing a surge in coronavirus cases sounded the alarm Sunday about the lack of resources to respond to the crisis and warned that shortages of ventilators and protective equipment could overwhelm hospitals as soon as this week.
Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that some hospitals in her state are “already at capacity,” and that even despite receiving new shipments of protective equipment as recently as Saturday, her state is “going to be in dire straits again in a matter of days.”

What is the coronavirus? Here's what we know about it.
Here's what to know about the new coronavirus, which causes a disease called COVID-19.
First U.S. case of deadly mystery virus confirmed
The coronavirus is a respiratory virus first reported in China in December, 2019. The illness has since spread around the globe, and the World Health Organization has characterized it as a pandemic.
The disease caused by the virus is called COVID-19.
Here's what to know about the coronavirus.
Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
What is a coronavirus?
The new virus is a type of a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause a range of symptoms including a runny nose, cough, sore throat and fever. Some are mild, such as the common cold, while others are more likely to lead to pneumonia. They're usually spread through direct contact with an infected person.
The coronavirus gets its name from the crown-like spikes on its surface, according to the CDC. (Corona is Latin for crown.) Including the newly identified form of the virus, there are a total of seven coronaviruses that can infect humans, the CDC says. Other well-known coronaviruses include SARS and MERS.
The new virus causes a disease called COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019, the year it was discovered.
What are the symptoms?
Key symptoms to watch for include fever, cough and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. However, the illness can also cause body aches, sore throat, vomiting and diarrhea.
Up to 80 percent of those who become infected appear to have mild symptoms and may not even know they're sick. But in severe cases, the illness can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization.
By far, the elderly — especially people over age 80 with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or lung diseases — are most vulnerable to complications of the coronavirus.
It's why the American Health Care Association recently released guidelines limiting visits to nursing homes and other assisted living facilities to curb the spread of illness.
Very few children have been diagnosed, and even in those cases, symptoms have been mostly mild.
How does the coronavirus spread?
The coronavirus is spread through respiratory droplets when a sick person coughs or sneezes. People within 6 feet of an infected individual are most at risk for inhaling these droplets.
Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
A person could also become infected through contact with the virus particles on a surface, though it's unknown how long the new coronavirus can survive on surfaces outside of the body. Research has shown that other coronaviruses can survive on hard surfaces for hours to days. If an infected person sneezes or coughs onto a surface, such as a countertop or doorknob, and another person touches that surface and then rubs his or her eyes or nose, for example, the latter may get sick.
The new coronavirus's incubation period — meaning the time it takes from a person being infected with the virus to when they start showing symptoms — appears to be anywhere from two to 14 days, though the average amount of time it takes a person to get sick is about five days, according to the World Health Organization. It's unclear whether a person is contagious during the incubation period.
How can I prevent coronavirus?
Soap helps lift germs from the surface of the skin, but it's the scrubbing that gets germs off hands. Hand sanitizer is a good alternative, but it must have at least 60 percent alcohol to be effective, according to the CDC.
Perhaps the best way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus is to keep sick people separated from healthy people.

Clinical trials on coronavirus drugs may take only months, researcher says
The concept, called social distancing, is illustrated in the myriad measures businesses, sports organizations, school systems and others are taking to cut down on large gatherings. Many public events are canceled or postponed; students and employees are encouraged to do their work from home, through the internet.
Otherwise, infectious disease experts recommend staying six feet away from others.
Does a face mask protect you from coronavirus?
The CDC does not recommend that healthy people wear a face mask.
Rather, the CDC recommends that patients with the coronavirus wear a face mask to protect others around them, or, if the patient cannot wear a face mask, others should if they are in the same room together.
Caregivers or people living in the same house as someone who is sick should also wear disposable face masks, along with gloves and disposable gowns, when coming into contact with the patient's bodily fluids.
For health care workers in contact with coronavirus patients, the CDC recommends a more specialized type of mask — one that is individually fitted to a person's face to create a seal and that filters out 95 percent of particles that at least 0.3 microns in diameters. (A micron is 1/1,000th of a millimeter.) This type of mask is called N95.
Is there a coronavirus vaccine?
There is currently no vaccine to prevent the coronavirus.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases expects to begin clinical trials on a vaccine within weeks, though it will take a year to 18 months to prove the vaccine is safe and effective.
Is there a coronavirus treatment?
There is currently no treatment for the coronavirus. Patients are helped by what's called supportive care, for example, to help them breathe.
A few coronavirus patients in Nebraska are taking part in a clinical trial for a possible treatment with an antiviral drug called remdesivir. Originally developed for possible treatment for Ebola, the drug has previously shown promise in treating other coronaviruses, such as SARS.
Other clinical trials of remdesivir are ongoing in China to test its effects on both severe and mild cases of the disease, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.
Do disinfectants kill the coronavirus?
Yes, they can. The CDC suggests that anyone exposed to an infected patient clean all "high-touch" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables.
Cleaning agents can include a household disinfectant with a label that says "EPA-approved," according to the CDC. A homemade version can be made, using one tablespoon of bleach to one quart of water.
Can coronavirus be spread through the mail or through goods imported from China?
It's extremely unlikely. While more needs to be learned about how this particular virus works, coronaviruses typically don't live very long on surfaces, and are very unlikely to survive over a period of days or weeks when an item is being shipped.
"There is no evidence to support transmission of [COVID-19] associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of [COVID-19] in the United States associated with imported goods," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, during a call with journalists.

Medical screener at LAX airport tests positive for coronavirus
State of emergency in Los Angeles County over coronavirus outbreak
WASHINGTON — A medical professional who conducted passenger screenings at Los Angeles International Airport tested positive for the coronavirus late Tuesday , according to the Department of Homeland Security and an internal email obtained by NBC News.
The person last worked screening air travelers for illness on Feb. 21, DHS said in a statement released Wednesday, which also said the medical professional had worn the proper protective gear while working. The internal email described the person as a "contract medical screener" for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its statement, DHS said: "Late last night, DHS headquarters was alerted to a situation where one of our contracted medical professionals conducting screenings at LAX international airport had tested positive for COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus. This individual is currently under self-quarantine at home with mild symptoms and under medical supervision. Their immediate family is also under home quarantine."
According to DHS, the person began to exhibit cold-like symptoms Saturday and visited a primary care doctor Sunday. The person was tested for COVID-19, which came back positive Tuesday.
The person's last shift at LAX was Feb. 21, more than a week before the appearance of symptoms. According to the internal email, the screener worked at LAX from Feb. 14 to 21 and became symptomatic on Feb. 29.

"DHS is happy to report that this individual was highly trained and did everything right both on the job and when they began to feel sick," DHS said. "We are told the individual wore all the correct protective equipment and took necessary protections on the job. Additionally, as soon as the individual began to feel sick, they self-quarantined, saw a physician, and reported to the appropriate authorities and officials."
Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan said Thursday that he was "confident we are taking the appropriate steps in response to that incident, to include contact tracing."

"At this time we do not know if this case is a result from community spread or through their work as a medical screener," DHS said. "There have been no positive COVID-19 detections reported from the LAX screened travelers. This is an evolving situation that the CDC, DHS and county public health officials continue to examine."
Acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said at a White House briefing by the President's Coronavirus Task Force on Jan. 31 that "our chief medical officer in the department is in CWMD, and [we] were providing medical support at the airports."
"We're using contract authority that we have to backfill the CDC personnel, so they can be freed up for other missions at the airports where medical screening is being focused," Cuccinelli said.

New York will be first state to test treatment of coronavirus with blood from recovered patients

Hoping to stem the toll of the state’s surging coronavirus outbreak, New York health officials plan to begin collecting plasma from people who have recovered and injecting the antibody-rich fluid into patients still fighting the virus.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the plans during a news briefing Monday. The treatment, known as convalescent plasma, dates back centuries and was used during the flu epidemic of 1918 — in an era before modern vaccines and antiviral drugs.
Some experts say the treatment, although somewhat primitive, might be the best hope for combating the coronavirus until more sophisticated therapies can be developed, which could take several months.
Cuomo announces 3 clinical trials for coronavirus treatment in New York
"There have been tests that show when a person is injected with the antibodies, that then stimulates and promotes their immune system against that disease," Cuomo said. "It's only a trial. It's a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of New York's best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise, and we're going to be starting that this week."
New York has seen a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases in recent days, with about 20,000 confirmed cases and more than 150 deaths as of Monday afternoon, more than in any other state.
State health officials said they expect to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration to begin the plasma trial in the coming days. A spokesman for the FDA confirmed to NBC News that the agency is "working expeditiously to facilitate the development and availability" of convalescent plasma. And at a White House briefing last week, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn singled out the treatment as a promising option to fight the disease in the near term.
"That's great news," said Dr. Arturo Casadevall, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has been calling for widespread use of convalescent plasma. "When we started talking about this a few weeks ago, it was just an idea, and now it seems it's going to become a reality."
Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
The method — essentially harvesting virus-fighting antibodies from the blood of previously infected patients — dates back more than a century, but it has not been used widely in the United States in decades. Infusions of convalescent plasma were associated with milder symptoms and shorter hospital stays for some patients during the 2002 SARS outbreak, and initial reports from China suggest convalescent plasma might also be effective in dulling the effects of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Coronavirus in the U.S.: Map of where cases have been confirmed across the country
In New York, health officials said they plan to begin recruiting patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19 in the coming days. That effort, officials said, would likely start in New Rochelle, the New York City suburb that was the center of the state's initial outbreak a few weeks ago, because of the concentration of people there who have already recovered.
Potential donors would first need to undergo tests to ensure that they are no longer contagious and to confirm that their blood contains the antibodies needed to fight the disease, state health officials said. After that, donors would go to a local blood bank to give plasma — the liquid part of blood left once cells and platelets have been removed — although the state is still working out logistical details.
New York will begin by offering the treatment only to critically ill patients. But, experts said, once it is proven safe and effective, the treatment will likely work best if given to patients before symptoms become too severe. Casadevall said past studies indicate that proactive infusions of convalescent plasma might also be effective in protecting front-line health care workers from becoming seriously ill.
Similar efforts are underway across the country as hospitals scramble to prepare for an onslaught of critically ill COVID-19 patients, similar to what's happened in New York and Seattle.

Doctors from nearly two dozen hospitals have joined the Johns Hopkins-led effort, Casadevall said, including researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, the Stanford University Medical Center in California and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. The researchers have been in contact with the FDA through the weekend, he said, and they hope to launch clinical trials similar to the one in New York in the coming weeks.
Michael Felberbaum, an FDA spokesman, said the agency could not comment on specific COVID-19 clinical trials. But he confirmed that the agency was working to facilitate the use of convalescent plasma.

Trump: Restricting travel in U.S. a 'possibility' if coronavirus pandemic gets 'too hot'
President Donald Trump said Thursday it's a "possibility" that the administration could impose travel restrictions within the U.S. to limit exposure to the coronavirus if certain areas get "too hot."
"You see what they're doing in New Rochelle, which is good frankly," Trump continued, referring to the city just north of Manhattan where there is a growing cluster of coronavirus cases. "It's the right thing, but it's not enforced, it's not very strong. But people know they're being watched. New Rochelle, that's a hot spot."

Imposing travel limits in the U.S. interior would be a significant step in mitigating cases as coronavirus fears roil the economy and cripple various industries. In a prime-time address to the nation Wednesday night, Trump announced a 30-day travel restriction on travel from many European countries as coronavirus cases rise. There were more than 1,200 cases in 42 states and the District of Columbia as of Thursday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency said 36 deaths have been reported.

Trump to suspend evictions, authorizes Defense Production Act to mobilize businesses to aid coronavirus response
The law, enacted in 1950, allows the president to force American businesses to produce materials in the national defense, such as ventilators and medical supplies for health care workers.
Trump invokes Defense Production Act to aid coronavirus response
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Wednesday he is invoking the Defense Production Act to mobilize U.S. private production capacity to combat the coronavirus outbreak.
Trump also said his administration is "suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April" to help those affected by the virus.
The Defense Production Act, enacted in 1950, allows the president to force American businesses to produce materials in the national defense, such as ventilators and medical supplies for health care workers.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had earlier called on Trump to use those authorities to address a shortage of medical supplies.
"It's used in times of war, but we must mobilize as if it were a time of war when it comes to hospital beds, supplies and equipment," Schumer said Wednesday morning on the Senate floor.
At Wednesday's press briefing, Trump said he considers himself a "wartime president" and called the coronavirus the "enemy."
The president also referred to the coronavirus as "the Chinese Virus" during his briefing, as he had in a tweet Wednesday morning and other times in recent days. When asked at the press conference about his use of the phrase amid reports of backlash against Asian Americans because of the coronavirus, the president said it's "not racist at all."

"You should be leading a national response instead of throwing tantrums from the back seat," he added. "Where were the tests when we needed them? Where's the PPE? Get off Twitter & do your job."

The Trump administration has come under criticism for its production and distribution of testing kits of essential hospital items, like masks and ventilators, to the states. The administration has insisted that it has ramped up production of testing kits and has gotten private industry to increase the manufacturing of such items. Sunday afternoon, 3M announced that more than "500,000 respirators are on the way to two of the more critically impacted areas, New York and Seattle, with arrivals expected starting tomorrow."
Governors, leading Democrats and hospitals have implored the administration to use the Defense Production Act to increase the capacity to produce needed equipment. The 1950 law allows the president to mobilize businesses to fulfill orders deemed necessary for the national defense, in addition to other measures. Trump authorized the law last week but has yet to use it.
Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor on Sunday threw cold water on hopes that the federal government will use the law.
"Will we have to use it? Maybe. But right now, this is what makes America so great — every company pitching in making sure we can beat this virus. And so it's been really great to see."
Speaking at the White House coronavirus task force press conference later Sunday, top White House aide Peter Navarro said, "We're getting what we need without putting the heavy hand of government down."
"Mr. President, stop lying and start acting," Biden added. "Use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go. President Trump's dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history."

"We've had a big ask into the strategic stockpile in the White House," he said. "They've given us a fraction of our ask. We are, as a state, private sector, public sector, nonprofits turning over every stone, but we need a lot more PPE, both to protect our health care workers and to treat the sick."

'Like sitting ducks': Amid coronavirus, families, attorneys sound alarm over ICE detainees
Americans with family members in immigration detention facilities, as well as their lawyers, are sounding the alarm and urging the release of nonviolent detainees with underlying health conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 24, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a person held in an immigrant detention center.
“This is what public health experts have assured us would happen: People in detention centers are sitting ducks for the spread of this virus," Andrea Flores, deputy director of policy at the ACLU, said in a statement. "The same experts have also predicted that once outbreaks in detention centers begin, they will spread rapidly."
María Vasquez, from Houston, is concerned about her father, Román Vasquez, 59, who is currently detained at the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas –- the same facility where an employee tested positive for the virus on Monday, according to a statement from the GEO Group that operates the facility.
Vasquez’s daughter expressed her fears for her father, who suffers from chronic bronchitis and Type 2 diabetes and is currently in isolation with COVID-19-like symptoms, such as body aches, congestion, and difficulty breathing.
“I’m scared he probably has the virus and he doesn’t know and they don’t know how to treat it,” Vasquez said.
Jawanmardi has tried to get Vasquez tested for COVID-19 but said that ICE denied his request. He also reached out to have Vasquez’s case dropped, or at least have his April 14th trial date moved up. He said ICE denied these requests as well. ICE says it makes custody determinations on a case-by-case basis.
Vasquez says she hopes the recent confirmed COVID-19 cases at the facility will strengthen her father’s chances of being freed.
Nearly 2,600 people in Washington have tested positive for coronavirus. The state was an early center for the virus, with a man in his 30s from Snohomish County being diagnosed as the country’s first positive case on Jan. 20.

Migrants detained inside ICE detention facilities are housed in close proximity to one another, Carney said, so if one person contracts the coronavirus, the results could be disastrous for everyone housed and working in that facility.
In response to concerns from advocates, family members and attorneys, the ACLU of Washington and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project sued ICE on March 16. The lawsuit sought the release of nine detainees at the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center at high risk for serious illness or death if they contract the virus.
Matt Adams, the legal director for the Northwest Immigration Rights Project, said he strongly disagreed "with ICE's assertion that the harm is not imminent simply because the agency has not yet publicly confirmed any cases of COVID-19 at the NWDC."
"I just hope our clients do not succumb to severe illness or death before we can procure their release,” Adams said in a statement.
The agency said that its epidemiologists have been "tracking the outbreak, regularly updating infection prevention and control protocols, and issuing guidance to ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) staff for the screening and management of potential exposure among detainees."
While ICE has said it has the ability to isolate and treat migrants who contract COVID-19, Carney is not confident that the agency will be able to handle an outbreak inside its facilities.
“He feels hopeless,” Machado-Orellana said through a translator. She says her husband has lost 45 pounds and has high blood pressure, which puts him at a higher risk of serious illness or death if he contracts the virus.
Carney had requested for Cantarero Lemus to be released, citing these health concerns, but said that ICE has denied the request.

Boris Johnson announces he is self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus
LONDON — Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for the coronavirus, he said in a tweet Friday.
He had developed "mild symptoms" in the last 24 hours and was "self-isolating," he said. "I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus."
Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus.
I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus.
In a video accompanying his tweet, Johnson said he had "a temperature and a persistent cough," and had taken the test on the advice of Britain's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty.
"So I am working from home and I am self-isolating and that’s entirely the right thing to do, but be in no doubt that I can continue thanks to the wizardry of modern technology to communicate with all my top team, to lead the national fight back against coronavirus," he said.

He went on to thank the police, teachers and the staff from the National Health Service, as well as the 600,000 people who had volunteered to help the public health system during the crisis.
"We will get through it, and the way we will get through it is of course by applying with the measures we have heard so much about," he said. "The more effectively we all comply with those measures, the faster our country can come through this epidemic and the faster we will bounce back."
A few hours later, Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that he had also tested positive. He also said his symptoms were mild and that he was working from home and self-isolating.

GLASGOW — In the Outer Hebrides, a remote island chain off the west coast of Scotland, there has yet to be a confirmed case of the coronavirus. But local leaders are worried.
Some were fleeing the boredom of self-isolation. Others seem to have been taking more permanent measures, traveling to secluded second homes or parking up motorhomes.
Lockdown ordered in United Kingdom as Europe battles coronavirus
Scotland now has at least 600 confirmed COVID-19 cases and, like the rest of the U.K., is now in near-total lockdown. All but essential travel is prohibited, with strict daily limits on outdoor exercise. Those who have hunkered down in the countryside have been told to head home.

Outdoor exercise is as important as ever, he said, but only when conducted in accordance with government orders: within the vicinity of an individual's house and respecting social distancing rules. “Coming to the Highlands doesn’t make you isolated from COVID-19,” Moir said. “You can’t get away from this.”

But in a pandemic, goodwill can only go so far. The nearest hospital — 11 miles away in Aboyne, a larger town — is for minor injuries only. To reach an intensive care unit, locals would have to drive an hour to Aberdeen, Scotland’s third-largest city.
“As a small village we’re not in the best position to be equipped for an outbreak like this, for the immediate people who live here let alone any outside characters contributing to that,” Barr added.

How and When Can Americans Access the $1,200 Coronavirus Stimulus Checks?

Part of the $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that passed unanimously in the Senate late on Wednesday night is an emergency universal basic income payment of $1,200 for most every adult who makes under $75,000 a year. (According to an estimate by the conservative Tax Foundation, 93.6 percent of tax-filers will receive some sort of payment.) While progressive Democrats and voices on the left have made forceful arguments for why the one-off sum is not enough, the $1,200 is an unprecedented step in U.S. politics. And like many unprecedented additions to the safety net, for many it’s unclear how the stimulus program will translate from an idea in a bill to money in Americans’ billfolds. To help understand the stopgap measure, below is a guide on how to access the $1,200 payment, and the political conversations surrounding the historic action.

CORONAVIRUS
Boris Johnson Tests Positive for the Coronavirus
The U.K. prime minister, whose government fumbled its initial response to the pandemic, says his symptoms are mild.
Is ‘Viral Load’ Why Some People Get a Mild Case of COVID-19?
As researchers try to understand why some people infected with COVID-19 experience mild or nonexistent symptoms while others require hospitalization, one factor they have considered is the “viral load” — the amount of the virus detected in a patient. “The viral load is a measure of how bright the fire is burning in an individual,” Edward Parker of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told New Scientist. Early indications suggest a correlation between the fire and the burn in COVID-19 patients: People with larger viral loads are generally getting sicker.
To get a sense of the scientific basics around this question, Intelligencer spoke with Dr. Ellen Foxman, assistant professor of laboratory medicine and immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, about the way viruses work, coronavirus testing accuracy, and how COVID-19 could be like other illnesses.
What do we know about the relationship between viral load and the severity of a COVID-19 case? 
According to recent papers that came out in the past week or so, at least in two papers from The Lancet, which is a quite reputable medical journal, there is a correlation between high viral load and more severe symptoms. That really makes a lot of sense, because viral replication is needed for a virus to cause diseases. Usually, only a few viruses get in your body, but then they begin to make copies of themselves. That process of taking over cells and replicating is what leads to disease. If the viruses can’t replicate much, in general they don’t cause as much disease.
In these papers, they did longitudinal studies. They followed people over the course of time. As you can imagine, if the viral load goes up and then it goes back down, the test result depends on when you are measuring. We can’t say, “This person walked into the doctor and had this viral load and that means they’re going to have severe disease.” Because the meaning of the viral load also depends on when in the disease process you’re testing.
Those studies are “preprints,” meaning that they have not yet undergone scientific peer review and are not officially published. For the paper from Italy, I don’t think the authors are making a case for lack of correlation of viral load with symptoms — they simply show a great degree of variability in viral load for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, so it’s difficult to conclude anything either way.
Did The Lancet studies distinguish between a viral load that is a measure of the virus’s replication in a patient and the infectious dose, i.e. the patient’s exposure? 
Yes, that’s an important distinction. Viral load described in the recent papers is the amount of virus measured in a sick person’s nose and throat. Someone is sick, they come to their doctor, they get a swab of their nose and throat, and the test measures how much virus is there. Based on The Lancet studies, measuring more virus over the course of infection correlates with more symptoms and more severe disease.
As far as transmitting from person to person, it makes sense that the amount of virus you are exposed to impacts how likely you are to become infected. If there’s one virus on a doorknob, you’re much less likely to get sick from touching the doorknob than if there’s 1,000 viruses on that doorknob. With a bigger exposure, some of the viruses are more likely to actually get into your airway and find a place to replicate. If you’re exposed to no virus at all, you’re not going to get sick. If you’re exposed to one little viral particle, you probably have a much lower chance of becoming infected than if you are right next to someone on an airplane who is coughing for eight hours. The amount of virus needed to cause an infection is the infectious dose, which is different than the viral load.
How will studying the viral load in greater depth change how we manage this virus? 
I think it’s very helpful. First of all, the way most people are tested right now is by putting a swab in the nasopharynx, which is the nose and the back upper part of the throat, and then looking for the viral genetic material. That’s the gold-standard test. But what’s really interesting is that the test isn’t necessarily positive or strong positive throughout the whole disease. That’s really important to know. Just because somebody is negative on that test, doesn’t mean they don’t have the disease. We’re making a lot of decisions on how to care for people, whether they should self-isolate, all of these things based on that test. It’s very important to figure out not only the viral load, but even how well these tests work to categorize someone as having the disease.
Studies showing that viral load correlates with severity of disease make sense in terms of what we know about other viruses. My laboratory studies respiratory viruses and it makes me think that a lot of the rules about other respiratory viruses may also apply to this one. It really helps in thinking about how to approach it from a research standpoint. What it says to me is, if the virus can be controlled and cleared when it’s still in the nose and throat, you are going to have a more mild case. I wouldn’t say it’s 100 percent, but what it says to me is that this virus infects the nose and throat, and if the local mechanisms to get rid of the virus are really effective and don’t let the viral load get too high, then that person is on the pathway to a more mild disease. Whereas if this virus is able to grow a whole bunch and really replicate to a high level in the nose and throat, you have a much higher chance of inhaling it into your lungs where the virus could set up shop.
Nothing right now. But I hope there will be something we can do eventually. My lab is investigating that. My laboratory works on natural defense mechanisms — innate immune mechanisms — in the upper respiratory tract that can quash viruses before they cause illness. Of course, there is no magic pill right now, but at least this makes sense and suggests some immediate directions to investigate.

Roughly 15,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the novel coronavirus that’s sparked global panic and killed more than 200 Americans. But the number of people in the U.S. infected with COVID-19 is thought to be much higher.
The lack of testing for the virus and the glacial pace at which tests have become available to many Americans accounts for the difference. Experts say this failure has led to more infections and stricter rules regarding social isolation, as public-health experts and local leaders err on the side of caution and attempt to isolate everybody.
Late this week there are signs, finally, that tests are becoming more widely available. According to The Atlantic, more than 100,000 have now been tested for the virus and you may soon join them.
“It’s a test. It’s a medical test,” he said. “Nothing pleasant about it.”
President Trump was asked how he felt taking the coronavirus test last week: "Nothing pleasant about it"
It “felt like I was being stabbed in the brain,” one TikTok user wrote in a caption of a video showing her getting tested in her car. “It’s awful. I’m sorry,” the health-care worker who administered the test says. “I wish there was a better way to do it.”
Another TikTok user who recorded her test wrote that the health-care worker administering it “knocked everything in my nasal passages loose.”

CORONAVIRUS
Boris Johnson Tests Positive for the Coronavirus
The U.K. prime minister, whose government fumbled its initial response to the pandemic, says his symptoms are mild.
At his Rose Garden press conference, President Trump attempted yet again to perform his mastery of the coronavirus. The president invited a procession of corporate chieftains, who — along with his faithful vice-president — lavished him with his customary praise. The purpose was to make Trump look, if only superficially, like a regular president.
Trump immediately sabotaged the display by eschewing his prepared text. CNN reported that Trump attributed his disastrous speech Wednesday night on his teleprompter (Trump “complained about the teleprompter from which he read the speech, blaming it for various stumbles including his inaccurate announcement that cargo would be included in the travel ban.”) Perhaps in reaction, this speech used prepared notes instead.
But this decision led to Trump’s characteristic habit of interspersing bullet point notes with little riffs, which create the appearance of a man encountering the words for the first time. “I am officially declaring a national emergency, two very big words.” When he announced his intention to have the federal government buy and store excess oil, he added the move was “Making us even further toward that wonderful goal that we’ve already achieved, of energy independence,” simultaneously announcing the goal would get closer but had already been achieved. He touted the decision by several athletic leagues to halt play: “It’s incredible what’s happening with sports. With the sports … Problems could be caused.”
The contrast in semantic fluency between Trump and the parade of business figures he invited to speak only underscored his haplessness. They were able to speak in complete sentences and use high school-level vocabulary terms, while he couldn’t. Trump even persisted in offering a series of handshakes — a practice health authorities are trying to eradicate — until one of the executives offered an elbow bump instead. The all-but-explicit message is that the federal government, and its oafish leader, is so inept that only the private sector is able to save us.
Trump tried to reassure his audience that his corporate partners had finally resolved the testing crisis that had left the United States, almost singularly in the world, unable to determine how many Americans had contracted the coronavirus. Trump repeated again his boast that fewer Americans had the coronavirus than in other countries. “Frankly, the numbers, because of the steps that have been taken, are at a level that a lot of people are surprised, especially when you compare them with other places, with far smaller populations,” he bragged. Of course the numbers may well be lower only because the United States has almost no capacity to find out how many Americans are infected. The number Trump is citing as his measure of success is the measure of failure.
Trump attempted to blame the government’s failure to deploy tests on the Obama administration, which has departed more than three years ago. The shirking of responsibility is self-evidently absurd: if Obama’s supposed red tape had prevented the Centers for Disease Control from handling the coronavirus, why didn’t Trump cut through it weeks ago, when the virus first alarmed health officials?
Another reporter asked if he took responsibility for dissolving the White House office charged with coordinating responses to pandemics. (Beth Cameron, its former director, has an op-ed explaining how damaging this move was.) Trump denied any responsibility for this decision, too. “You say me, I didn’t do it … I don’t know about that,” he huffed, calling the query a “nasty question,” and cutting off the reporter’s microphone.

The Fed’s Response to COVID-19 Is Impressive — and Alarming
Earlier this week, congressional Democrats and Republicans were locked in contentious negotiations over what the American public should ask of corporations before bailing them out. Conservatives contended that Uncle Sam should not interfere with these private enterprises’ internal affairs. After all, airlines, hotels, fast-food chains, and retailers didn’t create the economic crisis that now threatens to bankrupt them. Rather, the government’s failure to prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic — and the heavy-handed social distancing measures that its under-preparation necessitated — robbed these companies of expected revenue. Thus, the state had an obligation to extend cheap credit to corporate America, no strings attached.
The central bank’s unprecedented decision to start directly financing the “real economy” — as opposed to lending to private banks — came in the face of equally unprecedented conditions. The coronavirus pandemic hadn’t just obliterated demand in the service sector. It had also indirectly threatened the ability of virtually all corporations to access affordable credit, even if their business models were somewhat insulated from the effects of mass lockdowns and social distancing. Investors had lost their appetite for all manner of corporate bonds. This was partly due to a self-reinforcing flight to cash: Once anxiety led some investors to shy away from bonds, other investors began to fear that, if they didn’t also abandon the market, they would end up saddled with bonds that were impossible to resell without taking a steep loss. The Fed therefore moved to shore up liquidity (i.e., convertibility to cash) in the corporate-bond market through a relatively conventional intervention: It started buying corporate bonds from financial institutions at a rate intended to stabilize demand for such instruments. (The name for this program is the “Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility,” or SMCCF.)
But investors’ skittishness about buying corporate bonds wasn’t just about liquidity. It also reflected fears that a wide variety of companies might not be able to pay back their debts, given the COVID-19 crisis and its potential ripple effects. The Fed could not solve that dimension of corporate America’s funding woes by juicing demand for its bonds on secondary markets. Rather, this problem could only be significantly mitigated by providing cheap public credit directly to private firms. Which is, traditionally, the kind of thing that requires the approval of our government’s elected branches. But the economy was imploding, and Congress was dilly-dallying — and so the Fed just went ahead and established a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF).
But Kocherlakota was lonely in his alarm. For understandable reasons, few lay news consumers took much interest in (or notice of) the central bank’s latest alphabet soup of inscrutable lending programs. And anyhow, days later, the Senate gave its formal blessing to the Fed’s direct lending to corporations. Democrats were able to attach a couple modest conditions to the loans. But the terms were far more lax than progressives had been calling for; the public will assume the risk of lending to embattled corporations without securing any significant claim on their future profits, or durable influence over their operations. Meanwhile, discretion over which businesses should and should not be bailed out was largely outsourced to the unelected bureaucrats at the central bank. Congress simply provided the Fed with a (largely symbolic) $454 billion pot of capital with which to backstop upward of $4 trillion worth of loans, leaving the central bank in charge of divvying up that credit between individual corporations, small businesses, and state governments. There is now a bipartisan consensus in favor of top-down economic planning — just so long as that planning is done by officials who are less accountable to the median voter than to the median investment bank, debated far afield from the media spotlight, and articulated in acronym-laden jargon completely inaccessible to ordinary people.
During the 2008 financial crisis, private banks all across the world suffered from a sudden shortage of U.S. dollars. Such institutions had financed hundreds of billions in dollar-denominated loans by borrowing U.S. currency on wholesale money markets; when investor panic depleted those markets, their funding suddenly dried up. The Federal Reserve came to their rescue. By establishing dollar swap lines with foreign central banks — which is to say, allowing those banks to trade their own currencies for however many dollars their nation’s private banks happened to need — the Fed effectively bailed out banks throughout Europe. This constituted nothing less than an epochal reformation of global economic governance, executed with virtually no democratic input or even public awareness. As the historian Adam Tooze summarizes the development, “The central banks had, in other words, staged their Bretton Woods 2.0. But they had omitted to invite the cameras or the public, or indeed to explain what they were doing.”
The Fed’s dollar swap lines — like most of their crisis-fighting measures, both in 2008 and today — were preferable to inaction. Few Americans (or humans more broadly) would have been well-served by cascading bank failures across the pond. But our central bank didn’t just impartially stabilize the global financial system — it decided which foreign nations’ central banks would enjoy privileged access to dollars and which would not. Western Europe was cut in on the deal; Eastern Europe was not. These policy choices had profound geopolitical consequences, and were made without any input from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, or any other elected body.
Last week, with global banks once again running short on dollars, the Fed reestablished unlimited drawing rights for all 14 of the central banks that had enjoyed such privileges 12 years ago. Whether the central bank sticks to that legacy system — or extends its largesse to dollar-starved developing countries and/or China — is a question with wide-ranging economic and geostrategic implications. And it’s one that none of our elected officials are publicly debating.
Once independence was secured, the revolution’s merchant and planter wing beat back the masses’ calls for democratizing finance. But the ambition to exert popular influence over monetary policy remained integral to democratic movements in the United States for more than a century, animating the original Populist Party’s calls for expanding access to money and credit through the unlimited coinage of silver.
Today, private finance reins supreme, and monetary policy has been depoliticized. Goldbug cranks, socialists, and MMTers may agitate against the Fed’s independence from popular influence. But for the median voter, monetary policy is neither salient nor readily comprehensible. Meanwhile, liberals and conservatives alike hail the central bank’s immunity from popular passions as a positive good. And not without reason.
The coronavirus crisis is changing our world in many sorrowful respects. It has rendered our already atomized and aching society poorer, sicker, and lonelier than it was a few months ago. If this week’s bailout legislation plays out as some progressive analysts predict, the pandemic’s economic side effects will accelerate corporate concentration and income inequality.
But this disaster also offers a vital opportunity for beneficent forms of change. By accentuating the perversity of our nation’s employment-based health insurance model — which is now causing millions of workers to lose coverage in the midst of a pandemic — the crisis creates an opening for progressives to remake the politics of health reform. By spotlighting the indispensable labor that grocery store clerks and delivery drivers contribute, it could help unionists illustrate the market’s unjust undervaluation of such “low-skill” work. And by politicizing just about every aspect of our economy — which is to say, by forcing Congress to demonstrate the private sector’s dependence on the state, and to allocate scarce subsidies and credit between corporations, small businesses, and individuals — the crisis gives us a fighting chance to secure a more democratic and egalitarian form of economic governance.

CORONAVIRUS MAR. 13, 2020
This Will Get Worse The grim math of a coronavirus future.
March 10 was just a few days ago, but it already feels very far away — before the NBA season was suspended, Tom Hanks tested positive, and a national state of emergency was declared. On that date, Think Global Health, which is a project of the Council on Foreign Relations, produced a report that includes a data table that tells us how many people in the U.S. might ultimately die from COVID-19 under a variety of different assumptions. In the top-left corner, the table shows a scenario where 0.1 percent of people in the U.S. contract the virus and 0.1 percent of those die from it, leading to a bit more than 300 deaths. That’s the best corner of the table. We like that corner. What we don’t like is the bottom-right corner of the table, which contemplates 50 percent of the American population contracting the virus and one percent of those dying. If we end up in that corner, about 1.6 million of us will die.
We could land anywhere in the table. Beyond that, unfortunately, I can’t offer much more specific guidance — in fact, depending on which experts you ask, we could land outside the table, too. But our knowledge about our lack of a knowledge is a kind of knowledge. The coronavirus endgame depends on a series of unknowns. We keep getting more data, but we still don’t know how inherently infectious or deadly this virus is. We don’t know how well we as Americans will respond and are responding to those risks of infection and death: how effectively we will reduce its spread, ensure that our hospitals are capable of handling a flood of sick patients, and heal those who are in the hospital. The early public response was abysmal, but we don’t know how quickly, or dramatically, that is changing. And, in large part because of the appalling failure of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure an adequate supply of usable testing kits, we don’t know how bad the virus outbreak in the U.S. is already. However bad it is, things will get worse.
Roughly, there are two ways to address an epidemic that threatens to spiral out of control and infect much of the world. Plan A is to stop it by imposing public-health measures that reduce the rate of transmission, such that each person who gets infected ends up infecting less than one person on average, and the epidemic begins to die out. Dr. Cyrus Shahpar, one of the creators of the table that tells us so much about what we don’t know, told me the more benign outcomes proposed in its leftward columns are based on the apparent success China has had in doing that: Outside the Wuhan area, infections so far have made up less than 0.1 percent of the population. In the Wuhan area, the disease has hit approximately 0.5 percent of the population. In both areas, new infections are declining, not trending toward half the population.
But there are good questions about whether this success can be replicated in other parts of the world and even whether it can be maintained in China itself. China’s measures to slow the spread of the virus have been draconian, and the country is seeking to ease up on them and return to normal. But since most of the population has never been infected, most people remain “naïve” to the virus — they don’t have antibodies and are vulnerable to a resurgence of the epidemic, at least until there are effective antiviral treatments or a vaccine available. And over time, practices that shut down large fractions of the economy and society are likely to prove less sustainable.
It is possible, as countries ramp up their testing and surveillance capacity, we will increase our capability at managing the outbreak by identifying and isolating individuals with the infection, allowing us to reduce our reliance on population-level containment measures — this has been key to South Korea’s success at slowing the growth of new infections with less-severe restrictions on social activity than we are seeing in China or Italy. On Friday, the president held a press conference to tout expanded testing but dodged a question about when those tests would actually become available. And even at South Korean levels of social disruption, epidemic containment would require a more intense and prolonged change to the American way of life than a lot of people and even policy-makers have yet to recognize.
The even less palatable option is to try to let it run its course in the most orderly manner possible. After a large fraction of the population is infected — 40 to 70 percent are the numbers I tend to hear thrown around — many people will have developed antibodies, making it increasingly difficult for the virus to find vulnerable hosts to infect and causing the epidemic to ebb naturally. The big problem with this outcome is that it would entail a very large number of deaths even if the infection fatality rate proves to be on the low end of the estimates.
And then there is the Italy problem. There, as in the U.S. and everywhere else, hospitals have limited capacity to treat patients with severe lung illnesses. If the health-care system gets overwhelmed with an enormous number of COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care, the quality of care will deteriorate and a larger fraction of patients will die than would die in a well-functioning health-care system. This is why people keep talking about the need to “flatten the curve”: Merely slowing the growth of the epidemic, even if it doesn’t reduce the ultimate number of cases, would lessen the pressure on the medical system is considerably. But as I have reported this story, I have gotten an increasingly sinking feeling about the “flatten the curve” discourse for reasons that have to do with the other variable in the table: the fatality rate per infection.
U.S. hospitals contain about 900,000 hospital beds, of which fewer than 100,000 are for critical care. Of course, most of those beds are already in use for people with other medical problems — U.S. hospitals admit approximately 36 million patients annually. If 165 million Americans ultimately contract the novel coronavirus, how much would we need to “flatten the curve” to fit all those who need hospital care into properly equipped beds to avoid a situation like in Italy, where patients are being denied treatment for lack of available resources?
Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told me he believes that flattening the curve will only work to manage hospital capacity if the fatality rate from COVID-19 is on the low end of the range of estimates. “I was discussing this with a colleague, and I had been operating under the idea that maybe the infection fatality ratio was around one in a thousand,” Lessler told me. “And under that, things are very, very bad, but you can envision a world where we spread out the epidemic and slow it down and never overrun our ICU capacity.
“My colleague was saying he thought the evidence was closer to one percent. If that’s the case, that’s ten times as many, and then it’s hard to envision a scenario where health systems are not overrun. ”
Available critical-care capacity is not a totally fixed figure. The Johns Hopkins Hospital, for example, has the capability to provide critical care in non-ICU areas. As feasible and medically appropriate, it will free up ICU space by moving patients to standard floors. The hospital will delay elective surgeries, reducing demand for the surgical ICU and allowing for redirection of resources.
Still, there are limits, and the uncertain timeline is also a problem: We don’t know how long the epidemic will place additional strain on hospitals and the extent to which that time could outrun the sustainability of some of these measures. As Dr. Robert Scott Stephens, an ICU physician at Johns Hopkins, noted to me, elective surgeries eventually cease to be elective.
If the lethality of this virus turns out to be on the higher side of estimates, Lessler says the only public-health response that seems likely to keep any country’s hospitals from being overwhelmed is one that is “very, very, very, very intensive,” using whatever infection-control measures are necessary to keep the rate of new infections per new infection below one. Countries that take early and effective action, like South Korea, may be able to achieve that with more moderate social-distancing measures, while those that wait too long or fail to take the right steps may find themselves in the same position as Italy, with a complete lockdown as the only viable option to get a handle on the spread of the disease.
This public-health crisis will also produce an economic crisis of some scale. The stock market has fallen more than 20 percent from its record highs in February. Disruptions caused by efforts to slow the spread of the virus are having particular impacts on the transportation, hospitality, and energy sectors. United Airlines announced Tuesday that net bookings for domestic travel — new bookings minus cancellations — had fallen by about 70 percent in recent days. Net bookings to Europe and Asia had fallen 100 percent, meaning as many people were canceling trips as were booking them, and that was before Wednesday, when President Trump announced a policy restricting travel from most of Europe to the U.S. With fewer people expecting to travel, demand for oil has weakened and prices have fallen sharply. A recession in the U.S. has gone from improbable to very likely in a period of weeks.
As for what happens next to the economy, I can’t tell you. As New York’s business columnist, I have devoted a lot of time to thinking and writing about the economic-policy responses this crisis will require, but it wasn’t until March 10 that I realized both I and the economists I routinely check in with had been making an error in thinking about responses to the crisis: We’d been focusing on the light- to medium-bad versions of how this epidemic might go, without giving much thought to the bottom-right corner of that infernal table, in which this epidemic is worse than any other we’ve seen in our lifetimes.
“The more I think about this, the more this reminds me of post-9/11,” said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former top economic adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain, when I put the worst-case-scenario question to him. “You had to respond to the terrorist attack by attacking terrorism, and so the analogy here is we have a public-health mission that I continue to think is not robust enough. I think they ought to be giving the states a lot of money for test kits and ventilators and beds and lodging and all sorts of stuff — first responders’ protection. But you also then have to essentially harden the economy against the impact of the threat in the future, and in the case of 9/11, that took years.”
As with any crisis, there is also overreaction among the population. But on balance, there is still more underreaction. There is also the problem of delayed reaction. Lessler, the Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist, noted a way in which this epidemic tricks people into panicking when it’s too late. “If people are only going to start taking the actions they should when they start to see a lot of people dying around them, it’s already too late,” he says. When you combine the substantial period from infection to death with exponential growth in infections, the number of deaths you see around you is likely far lower than the number of deaths you are about to see. The people who stand to die within the next 30 days may not even be very sick yet. And when they get very sick, the hospitals may be overwhelmed and ill-prepared to respond. This is the corner Italy backed itself into. We might be headed there, too.

A total of 11 people in the U.S. have now lost their lives to the COVID-19 novel coronavirus, all but one of them in Washington State. On Thursday, the total of coronavirus cases in California grew to 36, with one death reported in Placer County northeast of Sacramento. As of Wednesday, 15 states had confirmed cases of coronavirus for a total of at least 159 nationally. Health officials in multiple states expect more cases of the virus to soon emerge as state and local COVID-19 testing capacity continues to ramp up.
Below are the latest developments on the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. and the response of public-health officials.
Pelsoi says Capitol is preparing for potential outbreak
In the event of a Washington, D.C. coronavirus outbreak, Capitol Hill staff will be able to work from home, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday. Lawmakers will not have the same luxury, she said: “We can’t vote from home.”
Cuomo: There are now 22 confirmed cases in New York
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Thursday afternoon that there are now twice as many coronavirus cases in New York state than previously detected. The doubling of cases — from 11 to 22 — will not be the end of it, he said. “The number will increase because it is math,” he said. “The more you test, the more positives you’ll get.”
Most of the 22 cases are tied to a 50-year-old man in Westchester who has been hospitalized with illness. The other cases are in New York City and Nassau County.
UPDATE: NY now has 22 confirmed #Coronavirus cases statewide – 11 new positive tests since yesterday.
-8 are in Westchester, all mild or no symptoms
-2 are in NYC, both individuals hospitalized
-1 is in Nassau County, a 42yo man, also hospitalized
Government will fall short of promise to have a million tests available
A few days after the Trump administration said a million coronavirus tests will be available by the end of this week, it’s become clear that the goal will not be met. “There won’t be a million people to get a test by the end of the week,” Florida Senator Rick Scott said Thursday after a briefing from health officials. “It’s way smaller than that. And still, at this point, it’s still through public health departments.”
Bloomberg reports that tests won’t even begin once the tests are received by local health departments:
Passangers on a cruise ship off the coast of San Francisco will not be allowed to leave until health officials can “appropriately assess the passengers,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. The Grand Princess is linked to the state’s first coronavirus death, a 71-year-old man who sailed from San Francisco to Mexico last month.
After returning to Mexico, the ship set off for Hawaii with 2,500 passengers, 62 of whom were also on the cruise to Mexico with the man who later died. Now, Newsom said, at least 11 passengers and 11 crew members have developed symptoms.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday morning that two more people had tested positive for the coronavirus in the city, bringing the total number of cases to four. More alarmingly, both of the new patients are in the intensive care unit — and one is in his 40s, well out of the most dangerous age range for coronavirus.
There are two new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City. One new patient is a man in his 40s, and one new patient is a woman in her 80s. 
Neither patient has a connection to travel nor any of the other local individuals diagnosed with COVID-19.

Neither patient has a connection to travel nor any of the other local individuals diagnosed with COVID-19.
Both are currently hospitalized and in the intensive care unit. 
City disease detectives are tracing close contacts of both individuals and will ensure they are appropriately isolated and tested immediately.
Trump offers bad advice for coronavirus patients
For people who suspect they have been exposed to coronavirus, the CDC recommends to “restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care. Do not go to work, school, or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.” Trump went a different route in his interview with Sean Hannity, stating that patients with mild cases of coronavirus can “get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work.”
Here is the President of the United States telling the country it's okay to go to work with Coronavirus.
Congress is expected to approve $8.3 billion in emergency funding
Lawmakers in the House and Senate reached a deal to approve an $8.3 billion emergency aid package to combat the spread of coronavirus, according to the New York Times. Per the Times report:
The bipartisan package, which includes nearly $7.8 billion for agencies dealing with the virus and came together after days of rapid negotiations, is substantially larger than what the White House initially proposed in late February.
It also authorizes roughly $500 million to allow Medicare providers to administer tele-health services so that more elderly patients, who are at greater risk from the virus, can receive care at home, according to two of the officials.
The first confirmed death in California
In Placer County northeast of Sacramento, officials announced the first coronavirus death in the state and described the patient as “an elderly adult with underlying health conditions.” The county health department states that the patient was exposed to the virus while traveling on a Princess cruise ship from San Francisco to Mexico. They tested positive on March 3. The death is the eleventh nationally, and the first to occur outside Washington state.
Also on Wednesday, NBC News reported that a medical screener working at Los Angeles International Airport tested positive for coronavirus despite wearing proper protective gear during their shift.
New York: 11 confirmed cases confirmed, was community transmission
On Wednesday, Governor Cuomo announced that coronavirus had been confirmed in 11 patients — including three family members of a 50-year-old lawyer living in Westchester who was confirmed as the second case in the state on Tuesday. Unlike the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the city, a woman who had recently traveled to Iran, the new patient had no known links to other outbreaks — the case in Westchester suggests that the virus has been spreading locally. Cuomo said that the man, who has been hospitalized and remains in serious condition, had an underlying respiratory condition.
It was not clear whether a student or parent — or neither — was suspected to have the virus. In any case, the move could have ripple effects across New York’s vast school system.
NEW: SAR Academy on 254th Street in Riverdale is closed due to fear of #Coronavirusnyc exposure
Washington State: 10 people have already died in the largest known U.S. outbreak
By Wednesday, state officials had announced the tenth coronavirus death in the state. Three people who died were elderly residents of a 190-bed nursing home near Seattle who had contracted the disease. A fourth person with the virus was reported dead in a nearby county. On Tuesday, officials confirmed that the virus had killed two more residents of the nursing home in Kirkland, who died a week ago. The Seattle area is also dealing with a new area of outbreak: On Wednesday, Facebook confirmed that a contract working at its office in the city was diagnosed with coronavirus.
On Sunday, state health officials confirmed the second coronavirus death in the state (and country). Earlier in the day, the state had confirmed two new coronavirus cases, both men in their 60s who were hospitalized in critical condition. Ten of the state’s 13 confirmed COVID-19 cases lived in King County, near Seattle. As of Monday, six people with the virus were in critical condition.
Officials are certain main more cases of COVID-19 will be found in the coming days. According to research published over the weekend, the coronavirus may have been spreading, unchecked, in Washington for as long as six weeks. If that’s the case, anywhere from 150 to 1,500 people may have been infected in there, according to models of the likely outbreak:
Researcher: If the coronavirus has indeed been spreading undetected in Washington since mid-January, that could mean that anywhere from 150 to 1,500 people may have it, with about 300 to 500 people the most likely range.
lth/coronavirus-washington-spread.html 
Coronavirus testing is getting easier in the state, however, and on Monday was up to a new capacity of roughly 200 tests per day. Indeed, health officials do not yet know where some of the people contracted the coronavirus, as they had no known links to other outbreaks in the world or anyone infected with COVID-19. That includes a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions who became America’s first coronavirus fatality over the weekend.
One of the places the unchecked virus found its way to was Life Care Center, a 190-bed long-term-care facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. That outbreak has already killed four people — a man in his 70s on Sunday, and then three more people on Monday. On Saturday, state officials announced that a resident and employee at the nursing home had both tested positive for the coronavirus, and that another 27 residents and 25 employees at the facility were showing COVID-19 symptoms. A total of 288 people live or work at Life Care Center, where, according to the Seattle Times, staff may have mismanaged this and other previous infections at the facility.
Washington State governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency in response to the outbreak, and state officials are already considering banning large events in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus. In King County, local officials have purchased a motel to use as an isolation center.
King County health officer Dr. Jeff Duchin warned on Monday that the state’s health system may soon be overwhelmed. He expects COVID-19 cases to overtake flu cases in a matter of weeks, at which point authorities will have to focus their resources on the worst outbreaks in the state rather than on individual cases.
The first newly confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state were reported on Friday, including a 15-year-old high-school student in Snohomish County with no known links to any other outbreaks or infected people, and a woman in her 50s who had recently returned from Daegu, South Korea, the epicenter of what has become the second biggest outbreak in the world.
The teenager had visited two area health clinics and briefly returned to school before testing positive. The teen has been quarantined at home, and the high school has since become one of many in the state that have been closed for a deep cleaning.
Georgia officials announced on Monday night that two residents had tested positive for COVID-19 — both from the same household in Atlanta. One of the people had recently returned from Italy, meaning the cases were not the result of community transmission.
New Hampshire health officials on Monday announced the state’s first confirmed case of the coronavirus in a resident of the northwestern part of the state who had recently traveled to Italy. The officials do not believe there was any community transmission of the virus related to the case, and the state epidemiologist stressed that New Hampshire’s health system was well prepared to respond to the virus.
Texas: A quarantine standoff in San Antonio
The mayor of San Antonio declared a state of emergency in the city on Monday afternoon in order to block the release of Americans scheduled to leave quarantine at a nearby Army base. This move came after a woman in quarantine, who had twice tested negative for the virus and been released, later tested positive for the coronavirus. In the 12 hours before she was returned to isolation, the woman spent time at a mall and a hotel near the airport — though health officials said the chance she transmitted the disease to many people was low.
Texas governor Greg Abbott has also worked to block any further release of people from quarantine and demanded that the CDC retest all of them.
Florida: Public-health emergency declared after two cases found
On Sunday night, Florida governor Ron DeSantis directed the state’s surgeon general to declare a public-health emergency after two people in the Tampa Bay area tested positive for the coronavirus — the first cases reported in the state. Health officials don’t yet know how one of the people, a man in his 60s, contracted the disease. The other case is a woman in her 20s who had just returned home from northern Italy, which has had the most reported coronavirus cases in Europe.
Florida health officials are working to identify, monitor, and test, if needed, anyone who has come into contact with the two individuals. The good news is that all three of the state’s public-health laboratories began conducting their own coronavirus tests on Saturday. According to the Miami Herald, that should cut the state’s wait times for test results down to no more than 28 hours — instead of the three to five days it had been taking to get results back from the CDC.
As of Monday morning, 23 people have been tested for the coronavirus in the state, and officials are monitoring another 184 people to see if they develop symptoms.
New York: A health-care worker returning from Iran knew what to do
Governor Andrew Cuomo announced New York State’s first confirmed coronavirus case on Sunday night. A 39-year-old Manhattan woman who had recently traveled to Iran tested positive for the disease, and health officials expect that her husband, who made the same trip, will also soon test positive. Both are health-care workers, so they took extra precautions to isolate themselves upon returning to New York, where they avoided public transportation and immediately self-quarantined in their apartment. On Monday, Cuomo praised the woman’s “textbook” efforts to reduce her exposure to others.
The governor said that health officials do not believe she was contagious while she was traveling back to the U.S., but authorities are still contacting the other passengers on her plane as well as the car-service driver the couple hired to drive them home from the airport.
Cuomo also announced the launch of new cleaning protocols at schools, transit hubs, and health-care facilities that cater to the elderly or people with weak immune systems. Though Cuomo acknowledged the certainty that more coronavirus cases would soon be confirmed, he and other officials urged calm and boasted about New York City’s health system.
As of Sunday, 32 people in New York had been tested for the coronavirus, and more tests are being conducted after two public-health labs in the city and another in Albany have begun testing over the weekend.
A man in his 40s who had recently traveled to Italy has tested positive for the COVID-19, state health officials announced on Sunday. His illness is a “presumptive positive” case, which means a local public-health laboratory has confirmed he has the virus, but the CDC hasn’t yet conducted a second test.
The man is being treated in a hospital and his family have self-quarantined at home, while Rhode Island officials work to locate at least 40 people who had come into contact with him. They will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days — and anyone exhibiting symptoms will be tested, state officials said.
The case’s link to Italy, where then man traveled last month before returning to the U.S. on February 22, meant it was an explained case and not likely to be part of a larger outbreak in the state. “We are not seeing widespread community transmission in Rhode Island,” explained the state’s health department director, Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott.
Illinois: Not clear how an elderly couple caught the virus
A man in his 70s from Cook County, near Chicago, tested positive for the coronavirus, local officials announced on Saturday. They don’t yet know how the man was infected. His wife, also in her 70s, has also tested positive, officials said Monday.
Both were reportedly in good condition as of Monday. State health officials said they were still working to identify anyone who may have come into contact with the couple.
The state reported its third confirmed case of the coronavirus on Monday. The first person confirmed to have the illness, who began feeling symptoms on February 19, works at a school in Clackamas County and “may have exposed students and staff there,” Oregon Health Authority director Patrick Allen said Friday. Someone who lives with that patient has also tested positive, but has a mild case and is remaining isolated at home.
The third infected resident, like the first, is considered a case of community transmission. Neither had any know links to other outbreaks or infected persons, and state officials are still working to determine who else has been exposed to the coronavirus.
This post has been updated throughout to include details of additional confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S.

Boris Johnson Tests Positive for the Coronavirus
The U.K. prime minister, whose government fumbled its initial response to the pandemic, says his symptoms are mild.
Boris Johnson has coronavirus
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson: “Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus. I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus. Together we will beat this.”
Data from other states tells a similarly apocalyptic story. Extrapolating from the available data, economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that more than 2.25 million Americans will have lost their jobs by week’s end, the highest level ever recorded. After adjusting its growth projections to account for this carnage, the bank now predicts that the U.S. economy will contract by 6 percent this quarter — and by 24 percent next quarter — as unemployment more than doubles. Goldman does offer the consolation of 10- to 12-percent catch-up growth during the second half of this year. To enjoy such a “V-shaped recovery,” however, the U.S. will not only need to make (as yet, far from guaranteed) public health progress against COVID-19 but also keep its business sector solvent enough to rapidly emerge from hibernation once the pandemic is under control.
From a crassly partisan perspective, meanwhile, the president’s party should be doing everything in its power to ensure a rapid rebound from the coronavirus crash. The fate of Trump’s campaign likely rests on whether strong growth returns in the third quarter of this year. Or at least, this is what GOP operatives are saying. And academic political science supports their view. It is true that, to this point, Trump has not suffered any decline in approval from the coronavirus crisis despite his literally indefensible handling of the pandemic (the president himself refuses to defend his own public statements about the virus’s fictional containment from earlier this year, preferring to simply fabricate an alternative recent history). But given the president’s personal unpopularity, it remains difficult to believe that his current ratings would survive a 20 percent contraction and 9 percent unemployment rate. Few incumbent parties in any democracy have ever won reelection while presiding over an election-year economic decline half as severe as the one we’re now entering. Trump and his party need a rapid turnaround by late summer. And the less they are willing to spend now to keep businesses solvent, workers employed, and households financially stable, the more improbable that turnaround is going to be.

CORONAVIRUS MAR. 27, 2020
Our Health-Care System Is Killing People
We still don’t know much about the 17-year-old who may have died of COVID-19 in California. He lived in the city of Lancaster; his father, also sick, is an Uber driver. He had no known preexisting conditions, and no health insurance either, according to a new Gizmodo report. In a YouTube video, Rex Parris, the mayor of Lancaster, suggested the teenager’s lack of insurance contributed to his death. When the sick teen reported to urgent care, staff allegedly turned him away. “He didn’t have insurance, so they did not treat him,” Parris said. Instead, they told him to go to a nearby public hospital.
He tried. But the delay may have cost him his life. “En route to AV Hospital, he went into cardiac arrest. When he got to AV Hospital they were able to revive him and keep him alive for about six hours,” Parris continued. “But by the time he got there, it was too late.”
Though the teen tested positive for COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have launched an investigation into his death to rule out any other medical factors in his death. But he wouldn’t be the only COVID-19 patient to die partly because of a lack of health insurance. A Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, woman died from the virus after she refused to go to the hospital for care. “She didn’t have insurance. She thought she might not be able to pay the bills,” her son told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
There are probably other cases like theirs, and behind each one, a person killed by our collective failure to protect them. About 45 percent of American adults were either uninsured or underinsured in 2018, the Commonwealth Fund estimates. Those people are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of any pandemic. They’re more likely to wait to seek care for fear of the expense, or to go entirely without it, and their ranks will increase over the next weeks and months. Because we tie health insurance to employment, a COVID-connected recession could potentially strand thousands, if not millions, without secure access to health care in the middle of a pandemic.
Our health-care system is not the best in the world, as the New York Times credulously claimed a few days ago. It is failing. Heavily privatized, dependent on the whims of industry and the vagaries of insurance companies, it is collapsing under the weight of a crisis. Rural hospitals continue to close for lack of funds, and leave the communities they serve without quick access to care. Even in wealthy, urban areas, doctors and nurses don’t have enough masks, enough ventilators, enough protective shields, enough scrubs. In Philadelphia, city officials tried and failed to convince the millionaire owner of Paladin Healthcare, Joel Freedman, to lease them the public hospital he purchased and closed last summer. Sprawling corporations donate masks here and there. But charity can’t plug the gaps through which the poor and the dying fall. Health care is a public good. Policy-makers just don’t treat it that way, and now we’re reaping what they’ve sown.
The fractures in our health-care system should not be understood as failures of the market. The market is working exactly as intended. It’s working for people like Joel Freedman, and for private insurance companies like Aetna. It was never meant to save lives.
The nature of the pandemic leaves elected officials with little recourse but to expand government. Democrats who may have once balked at the idea of handing out cash to the needy are championing a temporary universal basic income. As inadequate as the Senate’s emergency rescue package might be, it still represents a sharp deviation from mainstream Democratic policy. Big government suddenly looks like less of an electoral risk. While all emergency pandemic measures don’t make sense as long-term solutions, they should make something clear to the political class: Private industry will not safeguard the public. Corporations don’t exist to protect anyone; they exist to make profit. Human beings are valuable to them inasmuch as they have bank accounts to plunder. The mission of government, and the missions of companies like Aetna or Amazon, or of private-equity investors like Freedman, are irreconcilably different. Aetna can’t serve God and Mammon.
Those lessons won’t lose urgency as the pandemic winds down. There will be other crises, and we can’t survive them with the system we have now. Though the immediate priority of policy-makers is to stanch the public’s bleeding, they will at some point have to consider steps to make the next crisis less devastating for the people they serve. But to do so successfully, they’ll have to reconsider their hostility to radical health-care reform. All the hand-wringing over consumer “choice,” the fearmongering over cost, the blinkered insistence that American voters will never support more government control over health care take Democrats further and further away from solutions that would help save lives in the next pandemic. When people don’t have health insurance, they die. This was true before COVID-19, and it will remain true until elected officials do something to make coverage a universal experience. The answer isn’t Joe Biden’s public option, which would leave 10 million people without health insurance, but Medicare for All, which automatically enrolls everyone. One policy is expansive enough to meet the challenges the coronavirus creates. The other clearly isn’t.
In any pandemic scenario, the goal is to contain infectious disease as quickly as possible. But that’s much more difficult when large numbers of people delay or even avoid basic care because it’s beyond their means. It’s more difficult, too, in an unhealthy country, weakened by inadequate access to care. What COVID-19 makes clear, or should, to everyone is the universal quality of public health. No community truly suffers in isolation. Pain spreads. But we favor some communities over others, and we rank their pain, too. A health-care system that prioritizes a person’s ability to pay over their need for care can’t do anything in a crisis but fail.
To condition access to health care on employment status shifts the frame so what should be a right instead looks like a privilege. That perspective is killing people, and universal coverage means access to preventative care, which keeps people healthy and better able to fend off infection. Losing a job would no longer mean losing health care. While for-profit hospitals tend to oppose Medicare for All on the basis that it would undermine their bottom line, facilities would no longer lose millions caring for patients too poor to pay them, and public policy could ameliorate the transition’s financial impact. As matters stand, hospitals have an incentive to prioritize and recruit patients with private insurance. Inequality might be lucrative, but that isn’t a good reason to let it flourish.
Democratic skeptics of Medicare for All should remember what the alternative looks like. A 17-year-old in an outbreak tried to go to the doctor. He didn’t have insurance. They didn’t treat him. He died.

What It’s Like to Be Part of the First Coronavirus Vaccine Trial
On January 13, less than a week after COVID-19 was identified as the virus behind the outbreak in Wuhan, researchers at Cambridge-based biotech company Moderna proposed a vaccine to fight it. A little over two months later, on Monday morning, a pharmacist in Seattle injected Rebecca Sirull with that vaccine, making her the third person to be injected in a 45-person clinical trial, the first human trial in the country. To rush the vaccine to clinical trial, Moderna skipped animal testing, a somewhat extraordinary measure. Sirull, a healthy 25-year-old editorial coordinator at a research institute, will receive a second injection in a month and have her blood drawn regularly for more than a year. Should the test be successful, the more optimistic estimates suggest that a vaccine could be available in 12 to 18 months. Intelligencer spoke with Sirull about her decision to take part.
I signed the consent last week. At that point the news around coronavirus, and the policies around it, had escalated a lot. Initially, when I answered the letter last month, it was just a curiosity. By last week, when I could choose yes or no, I realized this situation is actually pretty dire and it’s a really important thing to be a part of.
I got to the clinic at 8 a.m. They have you fill out a questionnaire — it was the third time that we filled that out. It asked if you were feeling any symptoms of the flu or virus; if any of our behaviors have changed that would not allow us to be in the study. We did a drug test, a pregnancy test, a few different blood-draw tests for other things to make sure that we were still eligible. Then the pharmacist came in and gave the injection. The whole thing happened in 30 seconds or less, quick and painless. They sent us home with a form to fill out and a thermometer to record our temperature daily. They call every day to make sure we’re doing ok. I’ll go back for a follow-up visit on Monday.
What did they tell you about the vaccine? 
They’ve been very transparent and open to answering any questions that I have. What they told us is that it’s not a live virus. We don’t actually get exposed to the coronavirus itself. The vaccine is made out of a messenger RNA sequence that teaches your body to produce a protein with a similar shape to the coronavirus and then they check and see if you’re able to produce antibodies that would be able to fight that protein if it were to come in contact with it in the future.
Did they give you any indication about the probability of this vaccine working? 
You’re working from home in Seattle, under self-quarantine. It seems sort of counterintuitive to put someone who is testing a vaccine into self-quarantine and not coming in contact with the virus.
The test is not whether or not I get coronavirus. They do that with some types of vaccines, but for this one, the way they’re testing is by drawing my blood every week and looking at the number of antibodies that are in it. That’s what fights off the infection. If my body starts producing more antibodies, then they’ll know that it’s effective. So, the goal is not to give me the coronavirus.
It’s not a live virus, so most of the risks that they discussed have to do more with the site of injection itself (like  redness or swelling). I’m monitoring myself for fever, cough, nausea, headache. All of the symptoms of the virus.
Did they tell you anything about how the vaccine was developed? 
They didn’t do animal testing, which is usually part of vaccine trials. That step was skipped. That’s because they have made other vaccines that use this same technique as opposed to a live virus. Those other types of vaccines were shown to be either successful or not have huge risks to the participants. I believe that’s why they skipped the animal portion, since they had already done a similar concept for the flu. They had been experimenting using that same mRNA sequence, as opposed to live virus. It’s just applying that same theory to a new shape.
Living in Seattle, do you know anybody who has the virus?

Little did I know that the 2020 general election might be conducted in the wake of anything like COVID-19, with its particularly dangerous implications for people over 65. The positive test result for U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson was a reminder that heads of powerful governments are hardly immune — particularly if they are in the business of pressing the flesh and otherwise interacting with random citizens. So with all due deference to the superstitious fear of talking openly about this question, it’s time to follow Vox’s Ella Nilsen in an examination of what might happen if one of the two U.S. presidential nominees got sick and became debilitated, or worse.
Presidents have died shortly after taking office (William Henry Harrison died six weeks after assuming the presidency in 1841, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt died a few months into his fourth term). But a death before a candidate accepts the nomination or gets inaugurated is uncharted territory in American politics.
In either horrid scenario, Republicans would have an advantage since they have an heir apparent in Vice-President Mike Pence. Under the terms of the 25th Amendment, in case of a presidential death or resignation before the next scheduled inauguration in January of 2021, he would become POTUS; in case of a declared or admitted presidential disability, Pence would become acting POTUS until such time as Trump regained his faculties. Given Pence’s renowned sycophancy, no one in MAGA-land would likely object.
For Democrats, it’s trickier. In case of a pre-convention illness, a presumptive nominee could still accept the nomination in writing (which used to be the norm) or by a phone call. If the medical situation is more dire, Democratic delegates are not legally bound by candidate pledges, so a convention could, in theory, choose a different nominee. That’s even more obviously the case if the presumptive nominee were to die before the convention.
It remains unlikely any of this will transpire. Arguably, the national pandemic will not only make it certain that actual or presumptive nominees look closely after their health, but will also all but eliminate the routine campaign rituals that might expose a presidential candidate to infection.

833 New York Readers on How the Coronavirus Pandemic Is Changing Their Lives
This is the second installment of a weekly poll about how the coronavirus crisis is affecting our readers.
As COVID-19 continued to spread throughout the U.S. this week, the total number of reported cases nationwide topped 100,000. In New York, the epicenter of the domestic outbreak, more than 500 people have died. Here, 833 New York readers opened up about what’s changed in their daily lives since the pandemic began, and how they’re coping with the crisis.
Picture of health: 21.39%
Do you know anyone who has been hospitalized because of it?
Have you lost work or had your hours reduced since the outbreak began?
What’s been the biggest change in your life since the outbreak began?
“At the very same time the pandemic started to blow up in NYC, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I haven’t had the luxury to stay home, as I needed surgery and all the tests related to it. It’s been a harrowing and sad experience to walk the city while watching it slowly grinding to a halt, and our hospitals filling up. I feel almost lucky my surgery actually took place last Monday at Mount Sinai, in a last vestige of normalcy. In just 3 days, Manhattan has become another place. The reality just sank in. When I see the ‘butcher’s bill’ of hospitalizations and deaths, I feel almost guilty to need medical attention to prevent a cancer from slowly killing me, at a time when so many people will need every hand on deck to keep them from dying right now.”
“As a child of refugees, I’m a bit more paranoid than most of my friends, especially around issues of food security and national safety. So even though people in New York weren’t really freaking out in early March, I was quietly packing a suitcase. My mom is 68 and my brother is immunocompromised; we talked as a family and decided I’d go to their house in rural Massachusetts so there was a healthy adult to buy groceries, etc for them until it was all clear. I thought it would just be for a week or two. But now, I feel equal parts ashamed I left the city I love and grateful I’m somewhere with way less people where I can keep an eye on my family’s health and walk in the woods once a day. But I don’t know when I can go home again, and that’s hard and scary. I’m terrified of my family getting sick. I’m terrified of my friends getting sick. I’m ashamed I can’t help more people. (Why didn’t I go to med school?! Why am I an artist?!!) I’m convinced my empty studio apartment will be filled with squatters when I get back. I’m worried for friends losing jobs. I can’t sleep. And I know I’m one of the very, very lucky ones.”

How the Coronavirus Could Take Over Your Body (Before You Ever Feel It)
What you don’t know is that ten days ago, your friend’s father was a guest of his business partner at the University Club, where he caught the novel coronavirus from the wife of a cryptocurrency speculator. Three days after that, he coughed into his hand before opening the door of his apartment to welcome his son home. The saliva of COVID-19 patients can harbor half a trillion virus particles per teaspoon, and a cough aerosolizes it into a diffuse mist. As your friend walked through the door he took a breath and 32,456 virus particles settled onto the lining of his mouth and throat.
Viruses have been multiplying inside his body ever since. And as he talks, the passage of his breath over the moist lining of his upper throat creates tiny droplets of virus-laden mucus that waft invisibly into the air over your table. Some settle on the as-yet-uneaten food on your plate, some drift onto your fingers, others are drawn into your nasal sinus or settle into your throat. By the time you extend your hand to shake good-bye, your body is carrying 43,654 virus particles. By the time you’re done shaking hands, that number is up to 312,405.
One of the droplets gets drawn into the branching passages of your lungs and settles on the warm, wet surface, depositing virus particles into the mucus coating the tissue. Each particle is round and very small; if you magnified a human hair so that it was as wide as a football field, the virus particle would be four inches across. The outer membrane of the virus consists of an oily layer embedded with jagged protein molecules called spike proteins. These stick out like the protrusions on a knobby ball chew toy. In the middle of the virus particle is a coiled strand of RNA, the virus’s genetic material. The payload.
As the virus drifts through the lung’s mucus, it bumps into one of the cells that line the surface. The cell is considerably larger than the virus; on the football-field scale, it’s 26 feet across. A billion years of evolution have equipped it to resist attackers. But it also has a vulnerability — a backdoor. Protruding from its surface is a chunk of protein called angiotensin converting enzyme 2, or ACE2 receptor. Normally, this molecule plays a role in modulating hormone activity within the body. Today, it’s going to serve as an anchor for the coronavirus.
As the spike protein bumps up against the surface of the lung cell, its shape matches that of the ACE2 so closely that it sticks to it like adhesive. The membrane of the virus then fuses with the membrane of the cell, spilling the RNA contents into the interior of the lung cell. The virus is in.
As soon as the viral RNA encounters a ribosome, that ribosome begins reading it and building viral proteins. These proteins then help the viral RNA to copy itself, and these copies then hijack more of the cell’s ribosomes. Other viral proteins block the cell from fighting back. Soon the cell’s normal business is completely overwhelmed by the demands of the viral RNA, as its energy and machinery are occupied with building the components of countless replica viruses.
As they are churned out, these components are transferred on a kind of cellular conveyor belt toward the surface of the cell. The virus membrane and spike proteins wrap around RNA strands, and a new particle is ready. These collect in internal bubbles, called vesicles, that move to the surface, burst open, and release new virus particles into your body by the tens and hundreds of thousands.
Meanwhile, spike proteins that haven’t been incorporated into new viruses embed themselves directly into the host cell’s membrane so that it latches onto the surface of an adjacent cell, like a pirate ship lashing itself to a helpless merchantman. The two cells then fuse, and a whole host of viral RNA swarms over into the new host cell.
All up and down your lungs, throat, and mouth, the scene is repeated over and over as cell after cell is penetrated and hijacked. Assuming the virus behaves like its relative, SARS, each generation of infection takes about a day and can multiply the virus a millionfold. The replicated viruses spill out into the mucus, invade the bloodstream, and pour through the digestive system.
You don’t feel any of this. In fact, you still feel totally fine. If you have any complaint at all, it’s boredom. You’ve been a dutiful citizen, staying at home to practice social distancing, and after two days of bingeing on the Fast & Furious franchise, you decide that your mental health is at risk if you don’t get outside.
You call up an ex, and she agrees to meet you for a walk along the river. You’re hoping that the end-of-the-world zeitgeist might kindle some afternoon recklessness, but the face mask she’s wearing kills the vibe. Also she tells you that she’s decided to move in with a guy she met at Landmark. You didn’t even know she was into Landmark. She gives you a warm hug as you say good-bye, and you tell her it was great to see her, but you leave feeling deflated. What she doesn’t know is that an hour before, you went to the bathroom and neglected to wash your hands afterward. The invisible fecal smear you leave on the arm of her jacket contains 893,405 virus particles. Forty-seven seconds after she gets home, she’ll hang up her coat and then scratch an itch at the base of her nose just before she washes her hands. In that moment, 9,404 viral particles will transfer to her face. In five days, an ambulance will take her to Mount Sinai.
Like a retail chain gobbled up by private equity, stripped for parts, and left to die, your infected cells spew out virus particles until they burn themselves out and expire. As fragments of disintegrated cells spread through your bloodstream, your immune system finally senses that something is wrong. White blood cells detect the fragments of dead cells and release chemicals called cytokines that serve as an alarm signal, activating other parts of the immune system to swing into action. When responding immune cells identify a cell that has become infected, they attack and destroy it. Within your body, a microscopic Battle of the Somme is raging with your immune system leveling its Big Berthas on both the enemy trenches and its own troops. As the carnage mounts, the body’s temperature rises and the infected area becomes inflamed.
Two days later, sitting down to lunch, you realize that the thought of eating makes you feel nauseated. You lie down and sleep for a few hours. When you wake up, you realize that you’ve only gotten worse. Your chest feels tight, and you’ve got a dry cough that just won’t quit. You wonder: Is this what it feels like? You rummage through your medicine cabinet in vain and ultimately find a thermometer in the back of your linen closet. You hold it under your tongue for a minute and then read the result: 102. Fuck, you think, and crawl back into bed. You tell yourself that it might just be the regular flu, and even if worse comes to worst, you’re young(-ish) and otherwise healthy. You’re not in the high-risk group.
You’re right, of course, in a sense. For most people infected with the coronavirus, that’s as far as it goes. With bed rest, they get better. But for reasons scientists don’t understand, about 20 percent of people get severely ill. Despite your relative youth, you’re one of them.
After four days of raging fever and feeling sore all over, you realize that you’re sicker than you’ve ever been in your life. You’ve got a dry cough that shakes you so hard that your back hurts. Fighting for breath, you order an Uber and head to the nearest emergency room. (You leave 376,345,090 virus particles smeared on various surfaces of the car and another 323,443,865 floating in aerosols in the air.)
At the ER, you’re examined and sent to an isolation ward. As doctors wait for the results of a test for the coronavirus, they administer a CT scan of your lungs, which reveals tell-tale “ground-glass opacities,” fuzzy spots caused by fluid accumulating where the immune-system battle is the most intense. Not only have you got COVID-19, but it’s led to a kind of intense and dangerous pneumonia called acute-respiratory-distress syndrome, or ARDS.
With all the regular beds already occupied by the many COVID-19 sufferers, you’re given a cot in a room alongside five other patients. Doctors put you on an intravenous drip to supply your body with nutrients and fluids as well as antiviral medicine. Within a day of your arrival, your condition deteriorates. You throw up for several days and start to hallucinate. Your heart rate slows to 50 beats a minute. When a patient in the next room dies, doctors take the ventilator he was using and put you on it. By the time the nurse threads the endotracheal tube down your throat, you’re only half-conscious of the sensation of it snaking deeper and deeper toward your lungs. You just lie there as she places tape over your mouth to keep the tube in place.
You’re crashing. Your immune system has flung itself into a “cytokine storm” — an overdrive of such intensity that it is no longer fighting just the viral infection but the body’s own cells as well. White blood cells storm your lungs, destroying tissue. Fluid fills the tiny alveolar sacs that normally let the blood absorb oxygen. Effectively, you’re drowning, even with the ventilator pumping oxygen-enriched air into your lungs.
That’s not the worst of it. The intensity of the immune response is such that under its onslaught, organs throughout the body are shutting down, a process known as multiple-organ-dysfunction syndrome, or MODS. When your liver fails, it is unable to process toxins out of your blood, so your doctors rush to hook you up to a round-the-clock dialysis machine. Starved of oxygen, your brain cells begin to expire.
You’re fluttering on the edge between life and death. Now that you’ve slipped into MODS, your odds are 50-50 or worse. Owing to the fact that the pandemic has stretched the hospital’s resources past the breaking point, your outlook is even bleaker.
And then, you are flooded with an overwhelming sense of calm. You sense that you have reached the nadir of your struggle. The worst of the danger is over. With the viral attack beaten, your body’s immune system will pull back, and you’ll begin the slow, painstaking journey to full recovery. Some weeks from now, the doctors will remove the tube from your throat and wheel away the ventilator. Your appetite will come back, and the color will return to your cheeks, and on a summer morning you’ll step out into the fresh air and hail a cab for home. And later still, you’ll meet the girl who will become your wife, and you’ll have three children, two of whom will have children of their own, who will visit you in your nursing home outside Tampa.
That’s what your mind is telling itself, anyway, as the last cells of your cerebral cortex burst in starburst waves, like the glowing algae in a midnight lagoon. In the isolation ward, your EKG goes to a steady tone. The doctors take away the ventilator and give it to a patient who arrived this morning. In the official records of the COVID-19 pandemic, you’ll be recorded as victim No. 592.

Meanwhile, confirmed coronavirus deaths in the U.S. just crossed 1,000. In some cities, hospitals are already running out of beds for the severely ill and morgue space for each day’s dead. Some have taken to storing the deceased in refrigerated trucks. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 are still growing exponentially, while much of the country is failing to observe the CDC’s recommendations for containing the virus’s spread. If current trends continue, the United States may soon be the epicenter of both a global pandemic and economic depression.
The (disproportionately elderly) legislative body’s desire to isolate themselves in their homes is understandable — especially when one considers that some in their ranks subscribe to a conception of individual liberty so sociopathic, they feel entitled to swim in public pools while awaiting the results of a COVID-19 test. But teleconferencing exists. The least these people could have done was formally approve remote voting before skipping town.

Oxford Model: Coronavirus May Have Already Infected Half of U.K. Population
We’ve removed our paywall from essential coronavirus news stories. Become a subscriber to support our journalists. Subscribe now.
Because testing regimens across the world have varied tremendously, the actual mortality and hospitalization rates of COVID-19 have been hard to pin down. But modeling by researchers at the University of Oxford could provide some welcome good news, even if the initial takeaway doesn’t seem so promising. According to hypothetical modeling from Oxford’s Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease lab, half of the population of the United Kingdom may have already been infected with the coronavirus. If this modeling is confirmed in follow-up studies, that a minuscule number of those infected require hospital treatment, with a majority showing very minor symptoms, or none at all.
In the mathematical experiment, the researchers looked at the population who are at risk of a severe infection. While a risk rate of 0.1 percent suggested a high number of infected people — suggesting lower hospitalization and mortality rates — a higher risk rate of 1 percent implied the possibility of a more threatening virus at the population level. In the following chart, ρ represents the risk rate, with the dramatic yellow line representing the possibility of a majority of the U.K. population infected:
As ρ decreases (yellow), then over 50% of the population (!) has been infected.
According to the mathematical modeling concerning the 0.1 percent scenario, the coronavirus arrived in mid-January at the latest, and spread undetected for over a month before the first cases were confirmed. Based on a susceptibility-infected-recovery model — a commonly used estimate in epidemiology — with data from case and death reports in the U.K. and Italy, the researchers determined that the initial “herd immunity” strategy of the U.K. government could have been sound. “I am surprised that there has been such unqualified acceptance of the Imperial model,” said lead researcher Sunetra Gupta, referring to an academic report predicting that up to 250,000 could be killed if the government maintained its plan to suppress the virus “but not get rid of it completely,” as the country’s chief scientific adviser put it. As of Monday, 87 people in the United Kingdom had died from the coronavirus; out of a total of 90,436 tests, 8,077 were positive.
To see if their math checks out, the Oxford team is now working with researchers at the Universities of Cambridge and Kent to begin antibody testing as soon as this week. “We need immediately to begin large-scale serological surveys — antibody testing — to assess what stage of the epidemic we are in now,” Gupta told the Financial Times.
In an interview with New York’s James Walsh, Pulitzer-winning infectious disease reporter Laurie Garrett explained the public-health necessity of antibody tests:
The most important thing is that that test can be a public-health tool. If we had this antibody test, we can go around randomly selecting people in New York City and find out how many New Yorkers, including right now, have had this virus in their bodies. Since we know the virus has never been in human beings before, anybody who has antibodies against it has been exposed since January.
If we can get this antibody test mass-produced — and I know they’re working on it right now — and put it into commercialization really quickly, this could be a game-changer for the whole pandemic. One of the things we would love to know right now is how many people who have had pneumonia since January were actually COVID cases? Having answers to that question would make a difference on a policy level. If we were suddenly seeing a surge in hidden pneumonia cases since mid-February, that would tell us we’re in deep, deep doo-doo; that this thing is like Italy; that we’re going to suddenly skyrocket and our hospitals are going to be overwhelmed. But if, by contrast, the same number of cases are found in the historic samples going back to the first of January, that would tell us, “Okay, it’s gradually unfolding, we don’t have to go down to lockdown every single person in New York, we may be able to flatten the curve.” And that makes a big difference in terms of how drastic our policies need to be. 
Though the Oxford modeling seems promising, like all academic studies reckoning with the coronavirus, it should be read by the public with caution. If antibody tests did not prove the epidemiologists’ best-case findings, the modeling could undercut the success of social distancing measures that public-health experts consider vital to stopping the spread of the virus. It does, however, reveal the necessity of having the proper scale of testing, so that governments can make policy determinations that reflect the actual rates of infection and hospitalization.

‘We’re Flying Blind’: Why Testing for Coronavirus Antibodies Will Matter

In 1994, Laurie Garrett published The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance. Two years later, she won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting in Newsday on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, then Zaire. Garrett, along with other journalists like STAT’s Helen Branswell and Science magazine’s Kai Kupferschmidt, has emerged as a leading voice of information and guidance on COVID-19. Though Garrett has been accused of erring on the side of alarmism during past outbreaks, COVID-19 is unlike any outbreak this country has faced in more than a century. In a piece last week for Foreign Policy, “Sorry, America, the Full Lockdown Is Coming,” Garrett urged Americans to quickly decide where they wanted to settle in for the next few months. Intelligencer talked with Garrett about that scale of lockdown, why testing for COVID-19 antibodies needs to be done, the chances of getting a vaccine, and exactly how much blame should be placed on the Trump administration. 
What would a full lockdown in the United States look like? 
It’s going to look different in every part of the country. What I wanted to say to people is, You don’t have a lot of time. The wise course of action for any household is to assume there’s going to be a lockdown of some kind. Get yourself to wherever it is you want to be with whomever you think you need to be with, so that you’re ready as soon as an announcement is made.
At the moment, the most critical information is whatever we can get from the lousy amount of testing that’s getting done. I am really excited that a team at the [Icahn School of Medicine] and collaborators around the world have come up with an antibody test. We’ve been desperately needing an antibody test. Do you know the difference between the current PCR [RT-PCR testing] tests and what we’ll know from an antibody test?
Basically, there are a few kinds of testing information we wish we had. One is using real-time PCR — RT-PCR. You’re actually measuring the presence of the [ribonucleic acid, or RNA] of the virus in the host of the human sample. It’s telling you this person in front of you is infected at this moment. That’s useful for a diagnosis. But it’s not useful for very much more than that. On Tuesday the test might come up negative, but the person might be positive on Thursday.
The second kind of test would be an antibody test. What that’s measuring is: “Has your body ever seen the virus?” That’s useful in two ways. As a diagnostic, it gives the refined information: “Yes, you have this in you at the moment.” It also can guide the activities of the physician, who might say, “Gee, I’ve got a pneumonia patient, I wonder if they’ve ever had COVID?” But the most important thing is that that test can be a public-health tool. If we had this antibody test, we can go around randomly selecting people in New York City and find out how many New Yorkers, including right now, have had this virus in their bodies. Since we know the virus has never been in human beings before, anybody who has antibodies against it has been exposed since January.
If we can get this antibody test mass-produced — and I know they’re working on it right now — and put it into commercialization really quickly, this could be a game-changer for the whole pandemic. One of the things we would love to know right now is how many people who have had pneumonia since January were actually COVID cases? Having answers to that question would make a difference on a policy level. If we were suddenly seeing a surge in hidden pneumonia cases since mid-February, that would tell us we’re in deep, deep doo-doo; that this thing is like Italy; that we’re going to suddenly skyrocket and our hospitals are going to be overwhelmed. But if, by contrast, the same number of cases are found in the historic samples going back to the first of January, that would tell us, “Okay, it’s gradually unfolding, we don’t have to go down to lockdown every single person in New York, we may be able to flatten the curve.” And that makes a big difference in terms of how drastic our policies need to be. There’s a reason that the governor and the mayor and the mayor’s own department advisers are arguing. We just don’t have good, solid data to work with. We’re flying blind in New York City. They’re even blinder outside the city because the population’s more scattered.
We’re already past the point! I’m hearing from doctors all over New York, frankly all over the country, that they and their nurses and the whole medical team are scared to death. They have no way of telling who is carrying COVID. Only a minority of COVID patients or carriers who walk in the ER have the full-blown list of symptoms: the dry cough, the high fever, the loss of appetite, muscle aches and weakness, brain fog. The vast majority of COVID people never show that constellation of symptoms. They may show one or two. And many never show symptoms that are diagnostic at all.
If you go to any hospital, but certainly anywhere in New York City, there’s an intake nurse or clerk who has direct contact with all of the emergency-room admissions or people who want to be admitted, and that person’s job is to take all of your insurance information and also to do some form of triage, to decide if this is an emergency case that has to get through the system fast. But now we’re asking those same people to decide if this is someone who needs to be separated from the rest of the herd. And that’s a whole lot of a burden to put on someone, especially if they don’t have protective gear to wear.
There are two issues here. One is an issue of readiness, and one is an issue of economics. Let me start with the second one. We’ve had ample warning that this was going to happen. And it’s not just affecting personal protective equipment — everything in the medical system, every single tool that is used to treat patients is infected by this. Medical-device and -equipment manufacturers discovered decades ago that they can make their products much more cheaply overseas than in the United States, whether it’s thermometers, masks, or some of the most sophisticated equipment (CAT scans, syringes). When you have a disruption in the supply chain that affects China, you have everything backed up for not just us but for the whole world. What if every place in the world increases demand at once? Can manufacturers meet that acceleration of demand? So it’s not just that some guy in Kansas needs PPEs, it’s Rio de Janeiro, Malaysia, Singapore, everyone needs an increase in production at once. If you work the supply chain backward, let’s say with latex gloves, and you get all the way to rubber tappers, what’s the rate of rubber extraction? We’ve built a house of cards, and I think this is one of the key reasons that the smart folks on Wall Street are freaking out. We’re seeing this whole house of cards tumble with the epidemic. It’s affecting every aspect of supply chain and distributed production in the entire global economy. That side of it is not unique to the Trump administration.
However, if you think there’s a likely pandemic coming down the road that’s going to hit America, couldn’t you have created national stockpiles, or anticipated the need for domestic production? We have become what’s called an adjusted-time-delivery economy. Whether it’s a quart of milk or a Mercedes-Benz, in the United States, we want to do everything we can to avoid the cost of inventory and warehousing. The whole retail model that evolved in our country was based on zero warehousing — no company had a pile of PPEs sitting in a warehouse someplace. So that left only one government intervention to speak of, and that was the national stockpiles that were created essentially to deal with bioterrorism. They were accelerated after 9/11; we stockpiled some essential supplies — masks, ventilators, massive numbers of drugs, supplies to deal with radiation sickness, and so on — scattered around the country in secret locations. But unfortunately, the scale of the national supply level is not pandemic level. It is an incident level.
What do you make of the messenger-RNA vaccine, which is now going through clinical trials?
So far, we have one study that I know of, which was of only two rhesus macaque monkeys, that assures us it is possible to make effective antibodies against this virus. In humans, we have really mixed and confusing information from China and increasingly from Italy that indicates that some people may actually get reinfected. I’ll tell you why it’s confusing right now. Our tests are measuring whether you have viral RNA in your body at the moment, and there’s a limit to how sensitive they are. In the early days of HIV, when [AIDS researcher] David Ho was named Man of the Year by Time magazine, there was this declaration that we’ve conquered HIV because tests stopped finding the virus in the bodies of people who were on these antiviral drugs. But it turned out that the problem was the tests just weren’t sensitive enough. The virus could hide inside of cells. The minute you went off your treatment, you got AIDS and died. Now we know that none of the people put on HIV treatment can ever get off their drugs. The worst-case scenario is that it’s the same thing with the coronavirus, that it’s capable of lurking at incredibly low levels in the human body and then at some advantageous moment, long after you think you’ve become immunized, it can surge back.
How do you account for the coronavirus patients who have become infected a second time?
There’s two possible explanations. One is that the virus is actually lurking, never really gone, and you’ve had false claims of being cured. The other is that in fact the immune system is not making an effective neutralizing antibody response, so some percentage of these people are not truly immune and they can get reinfected. We don’t know which is true. This rhesus macaque study I mentioned gives us hope. It indicates that those monkeys make effective neutralizing antibodies and cannot get reinfected. But it’s just two monkeys, for God’s sake! Until we really know the answer, the whole idea of going the vaccine route makes me nervous. We just don’t know if it will work. While we’re trying to make vaccines, and while various companies around the world are frantically ploughing ahead, the virus itself is out there naturally mutating. If you go to www.gisaid.org, an open-source repository of all genetic strains of the COVID-19 virus, you’ll see that we already have 683 fully sequenced versions of the virus. That’s not HIV-level of mutation, but it’s a lot!
So that makes me worried that a year from now, when we finally have something that looks promising and we’re ready to go into large clinical trials, there may be enough strains that it has to be treated like the annual flu vaccine, where you actually get five or six viral vaccines at once because there’s so many different strains of flu out there. I’m not at all optimistic that we’re going to have a vaccine in a year or even a year and a half. I think it’s going to be far more complicated
This epidemic is moving so fast that whatever you write is probably out of date by the time it’s published. Everybody’s just racing and trying to be as accurate as possible. But you know that much of what you write is going to turn out not to be true five days later. Maybe even five hours after publication. Given that, I think a lot of the reporting has been excellent.
But there’s a huge generation gap in terms of where people get their news. The whole idea of getting your daily New York Times to absorb what’s going on in the world is a marvelous, quaint notion of the past. So if you’re a younger adult, or frankly an older child, you’re likely to be osmotically absorbing this vast array of factoids off the internet, whether it’s Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or you’re sitting in Reddit chatrooms, God help you, and somehow you personally are trying to filter the accuracy of that information. And that’s a pretty lousy way of having people decide what to do in a pandemic.
I wrote a piece that was published in The Lancet, arguing that it was insane that the primary voices of accurate information and up-to-date analysis of the pandemic had such poorly funded communications efforts. The World Health Organization has only five full-time communications officers — for every time zone on earth, for every language on the planet. Five people! One was for all social media on earth. This is true of every health-department agency. It’s true of CDC. Communications always ends up on the bottom of the pile. People who call themselves journalists with a capital J are counting on institutions like WHO to supply a steady stream of accurate assessment and reassessment. Those kinds of institutions have five sleep-deprived people working 24/7 to do that.
You have a whole other layer of difficulty created by governments trying to control information. China has been tearing down social media like crazy, and now they’re trying to shift the entire narrative into one that attacks the United States and says that the virus did not originate in China but in a military laboratory in the United States. But we have it here, too! Our CDC makes decisions about which kinds of reporters they choose to respond to. Certain people get blackballed, and you can’t get answers to your questions because you’ve written something that the director of the CDC found critical, found unreliable. Our top voice of reason, Dr. Tony Fauci at NIAID — he’s an amazing guy and has boundless energy, particularly for a man of his age, but you can only split hairs so far. Eventually, that human can’t answer every single journalist’s query and can’t deal with every single information outlet. I’ve been very heartened to see that Fox News is no longer claiming that the entire epidemic is a hoax created by liberals in order to smear the president. We are seeing a kind of deer caught in headlights. Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and all these people are trying to act as genuine news anchors, anchoring accurate information about an epidemic, and that’s so new to them that you see them suddenly grasping, Oh, now what do I do? What does a real anchor say now?

Merkel made no specific announcements and called for no nationwide curfews or additional closures. Yet what gave her address its force was her tone, which was direct, honest, and searingly empathic. She laid bare not just the test we all face but also the solace that leadership can provide. Without accusations, boasts, hedges, obfuscations, dubious claims, or apocalyptic metaphors she did what a leader is supposed to do: explain the gravity of the situation and promise that the government’s help would flow to everyone who needed it. She gave full-throated thanks to front-line medical workers, assured Germans that there is no need to hoard, and paused to offer gratitude to a group of workers who rarely get recognized by heads of state on national TV: “Those who sit at supermarket cash registers or restock shelves are doing one of the hardest jobs there is right now.”

Low Coronavirus Mutation Rate Gives Researchers Hope for Eventual Vaccine: Report

As the World Health Organization launches trials for potential treatments for COVID-19, scientists studying the coronavirus are encouraged that its low mutation rate could mean that a single vaccine is possible.
According to researchers who spoke with the Washington Post, there are only around four to ten genetic differences between the coronavirus strains that have infected Americans and those of the original virus in Wuhan. “That’s a relatively small number of mutations for having passed through a large number of people,” Peter Thielen, a Johns Hopkins molecular geneticist, told the Post. “At this point, the mutation rate of the virus would suggest that the vaccine developed for SARS-CoV-2 would be a single vaccine, rather than a new vaccine every year like the flu vaccine.” Rather, a potential coronavirus vaccine would act more like those for the measles or chicken pox, in which one shot grants immunity for a substantial amount of time.
According to the current research, the virus that causes COVID-19 has a low “error rate,” meaning that its pace of mutation remains slow despite its rapid spread. Because it remains more or less stable as it travels through hundreds of thousands of patients, researchers state that it is less likely to become more dangerous (or less) as it spreads. “The virus has not mutated to any significant extent,” University of Iowa virologist Stanley Perlman said. “Just one ‘pretty bad’ strain for everybody so far. If it’s still around in a year, by that point we might have some diversity.”
Though researchers who spoke with the Post did not identify a possible timeline for a vaccine, one biotech firm hopes that trials could be ready as soon as the fall — though more conservative estimates suggest next year at the earliest.

As of Saturday afternoon, there have been at least 52,318 confirmed cases of the coronavirus discovered in the state, including nearly 30,000 in New York City. At least 728 people with COVID-19 have died in the state, which has the largest number — around 46 percent — of confirmed cases in the U.S.
Nationwide, more than 113,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed across all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and three U.S. territories. At least 1,895 people have died from the virus in the country. COVID-19 has killed more than 28,000 worldwide.
As more widespread testing is done, the full scope and scale of the New York (and national) outbreak becomes more clear, including how much the virus continues to spread. Below is what we know about the reported cases and consequences in New York thus far.
As of Saturday afternoon, health officials have confirmed at least:
728 deaths from the coronavirus in the state
Over 29,777 cases in New York City, including 517 deaths
8,825 cases in New Jersey, with 108 deaths
1,291 cases in Connecticut, with 27 deaths
The above counts are of laboratory-tested and confirmed cases of COVID-19 and should not be mistaken for the actual number of people who have or have had the coronavirus in the region. Similarly, updates to the totals are not necessarily new infections — they are newly discovered infections.
President Trump on Saturday claimed that he was considering a “short term, two week quarantine” of New York, New Jersey, and parts of Connecticut — restricting movement out of those “hot spots” in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Speaking with reporters, the president said that order may come as early as Saturday. He also said he had just spoken with Governor Andrew Cuomo.
Governor Cuomo later made it clear he had no idea what Trump was talking about after being asked by reporters about the possible order during his daily coronavirus briefing. “I don’t even know what that means,” Cuomo responded, indicating the two did not discuss such a measure in their conversation.
“I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view, I don’t know what you would be accomplishing. … I don’t like the sound of it,” Cuomo added.
WATCH: NEWS President Trump says he is considering an enforceable quarantine of hot spots in northeast to restrict  travel. #coronavirus
I am giving consideration to a QUARANTINE of developing “hot spots”, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. A decision will be made, one way or another, shortly.
Here is what NBC News’s Pete Williams explained earlier this month on the legality of a national quarantine order:
Broadly speaking, the CDC has the power to detain people suspected of having a communicable disease, without getting approval from state and local officials. It comes under the public health laws that allow the federal government to impose restrictions either on people coming into the country or traveling from one state to another. … However, that authority is rarely used, and when it has been invoked, it was directed at individuals and small groups.
[The federal government’s quarantine] authority is limited to restricting the movement of anyone who “is reasonably believed to be infected with a quarantinable communicable disease.” It’s not at all certain how that would apply to large groups of people. Under the law, there is no explicit statutory authority for a blanket federal interstate quarantine, only for the isolation of individual people deemed infected.
11 percent of NYPD officers out sick; 500 department employees have COVID-19, a detective has died
Some 4,000 NYPD employees were out sick on Friday, department officials reported — roughly 11 percent of the workforce. 500 department employees have tested positive, including 442 officers and 70 civilians. and three have died, including a detective and 23-year-veteran assigned to the 23rd precinct in Harlem — the first NYPD officer to die from the virus; a civilian employee and seven-year-veteran named Giacomina Barr-Brown; and a police headquarters custodian named Dennis Dickson.
This is a map released by NYC mapping the city in COVID-19 infection. Redder is higher percentage of positive tests. Anyone familiar with the city will see that the pattern lines up at least broadly with the city's wealth. Which makes sense, poorer areas more cramped conditions..
2/ less ability to telecommute, more continued work in the essential services driving the city through the crisis, etc. But another distinct possibility is that people in Manhattan and in the wealthier parts of Brooklyn, Riverdale, etc are getting more tests.
“It’s not a helpful map,” goes on to acknowledge, “the city government is being very stingy with data. Without knowing where the most tests are being taken, who knows [if the wealthier parts of the cities are simply performing more]. A valuable map would show numbers relative to population. And then layered on with intensity of testing.”
President Trump on Thursday night said he didn’t believe claims from Governor Andrew Cuomo that New York will need 30,000 ventilators to cope with the coming crush of coronavirus cases. “I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be,” Trump told Sean Hannity on his Fox News show. “I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you go into major hospitals sometimes they’ll have 2 ventilators, and now all of a sudden they’re saying, ‘Can we order 30,000 ventilators?’”
Even before the $2 trillion federal stimulus bill cleared the Senate Wednesday night, Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio lodged their complaints. Cuomo said the bill would be “terrible for the state of New York,” and de Blasio called the deal “immoral” for allocating only $1 billion to the city hit hardest by the outbreak.
In his Thursday morning press conference, Cuomo complained that the stimulus ear marks $5 billion for New York’s COVID-19 response. “It does absolutely nothing for us in terms of lost revenue for the state,” he said. The stimulus, which he called “irresponsible” and “reckless,” “simply failed to address the governmental need.”
Kious Kelly, a 48-year-old nurse died at what was formerly known as Roosevelt Hospital; workers there state that there the facility has not provided them with enough personal protective equipment, or PPE.
On Thursday, Dr. Peter Shearer, the chief medical officer at Mount Sinai in Brooklyn, spoke with New York, describing the intensity of the crisis his hospital is dealing with: “I’ve been through the blackout. I’ve been through Sandy. I’ve been through the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. And this is different. 9/11 was a horrendous thing, but there was no impact like this on hospitals. Sandy, some hospitals were completely devastated, and it was horrendous and awful, but the weather got better. And you could start cleaning up. But this is just getting worse. I have never been in a war. It feels like a war.”
Stretches of one street in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan will be shut down to vehicle traffic and opened to pedestrians in a pilot of a program meant to make social distancing easier by giving people more space to walk. The following streets will be closed to cars from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. from Friday to Monday.
Brooklyn: Bushwick Avenue, between Johnson Avenue and Flushing Avenue.
COVID-19 spreading fast in NYC jails
New York City has seen a faster spread of the coronavirus than any other place in the U.S. and the city’s jails have it even worse. According to an analysis by the Legal Aid Society, there are now 14.5 infections per 1,000 inmates in city jails. That’s compared to two per 1,000 people in the city at large. On Wednesday, the Department of Corrections reported 75 total cases in city jails, up from 52 cases reported Tuesday.
An ‘apocalyptic’ report from Elmhurst Hospital Center
At the 545-bed public hospital in central Queens, 13 people at Elmhurst had died in 24 hours from the coronavirus. “It’s apocalyptic,” Dr. Ashley Bray, a general medicine resident, told the New York Times. As the paper reported, in a period of a few hours on Tuesday, “Bray performed chest compressions at Elmhurst Hospital Center on a woman in her 80s, a man in his 60s and a 38-year-old who reminded the doctor of her fiancé. All had tested positive for the coronavirus and had gone into cardiac arrest. All eventually died.”
Evidence social distancing measures are working
In a rare bit of good news from Gov. Andrew Cuomo Wednesday press conference, he said there is some evidence that the social distancing measures taken by New York residents are working. To demonstrate, he pointed to projections of how many hospital beds will be needed in the state to treat patients. As of Sunday, he said, the projection was hospitalizations would double every two days. But on Monday, the projection shifted, with doubling expected every 3.4 days. The trend continued Tuesday as doubling expected every 4.7 days.
40,000 sign-ups for surge health-care force
In anticipation of a coming peak in coronavirus cases, the state has reached out to retirees and medical professionals who are out of the occupation to build what Cuomo called a “surge medical force.” So far, he said, there have been 40,000 sign-ups for “possible reserve duty.” Among them are 2,265 physicians, 2,409 nurse practitioners, and more than 16,000 registered nurses.
Man - 40,000 additional medical professionals have volunteered to help fight coronavirus in New York. How amazing is that?
Senior medical students at NYU have been offered a chance to graduate three months early if they agree to immediately go to work at NYU Langone Health’s Internal Medicine and Emergency Medicine departments. The offer was made in an email to students Tuesday. “With the growing spread of COVID-19, our hospitals inundated with patients, and our colleagues on the front lines working extra-long hours, we are still short-staffed in emergency and internal medicine,” the e-mail said.
The situation in New York City’s hospitals has become increasingly dire as cases in the city continue to rise.
NYC’s taxi industry, like many other industries, is being decimated by the coronavirus outbreak and shutdowns that have followed. Some drivers tell the Times they’re now waiting five or six hours for one passenger, and the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade reported a 91 percent drop in ridership last weekend. “This crisis is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before,” City Council Speaker Corey Johnson told the paper. “Every New Yorker is struggling, and for-hire vehicle drivers are among the hardest hit.”
Inside New York’s hospitals
The Associated Press reports on how health care workers are withstanding the surge of coronavirus patients:
A “cacophony of coughing” in packed emergency rooms. Beds squeezed in wherever there is space. Overworked, sleep-deprived doctors and nurses rationed to one face mask a day and wracked by worry about a dwindling number of available ventilators. …
White House asks anyone leaving NYC area to self-quarantine for 14 days, Fauci says 1/1000 New Yorkers likely infected
“For anyone in the New York metropolitan area who has traveled, our task force is encouraging you to monitor your temperature, be sensitive to symptoms,” explained Vice President Pence in a Tuesday afternoon press conference, “And we are asking anyone who has traveled out of the New York City metropolitan area to anywhere else in the country to self isolate for 14 days.”
The recommendation, which was endorsed by both National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci and coronavirus task force coordinator Deborah Birx, came in light of the tens of thousands of COVID-19 cases which have been discovered in and around the city in recent weeks. Fauci highlighted the exodus of many New Yorkers to other parts of the country. “They’re going to Florida. They’re going to Long Island. They’re going to different places,” Fauci said.
He estimated that roughly one out of every thousand people leaving the New York City area were infected, a “disturbing” statistic which he said was “about eight to 10 times more than in other areas.”
Birx recommended that the self-quarantines begin based on when people left, and she praised Florida governor Ron DeSantis’s self-quarantine order for anyone arriving in Florida from the tri-state area — and order DeSantis said Tuesday he would expand to also retroactively include everyone who had come to Florida from the area over the past three weeks.
Per the Washington Post, Trump was clearly looking to blame Governor Cuomo for the New York outbreak during a Tuesday town hall on Fox News:
Early in his appearance, he referred to an allegation floating around on fringe websites that Cuomo had in 2015 turned down thousands of ventilators. There was no pandemic taking place at that point, and the source was former New York lieutenant governor Betsy McCaughey (R), who offered no apparent substantiation. The report accused Cuomo of establishing “death panels and lottery instead.”
Trump tried to hand a copy of the report to Fox News host Bill Hemmer, but Hemmer cited the need for social distancing.
When Deborah Birx, the head of the government’s coronavirus task force, weighed in on why the problem was worse in New York than in other states, she cited the density of the metropolitan area’s population and the fact that travelers may have returned there from Asia before travel restrictions went into place. Trump wanted her to cite another reason, though: Cuomo. He cut in on Birx and asked her, “Do you blame the governor for that?”
Cuomo: Peak of the outbreak will be higher and sooner than previously thought
Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday revised the most dire projections for the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in New York. Rather than the 110,000 beds previously thought to be needed when the outbreak peaks, he said the state will require 140,000. “The apex is higher than we thought, and the apex is sooner than we thought,” he said in a press conference at the Javits Center.
A super powerful moment from Cuomo's press conference today on the Fed's response to COVID-19 in NY. "You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators."
The outbreak hits the MTA
The MTA on Tuesday said it is cutting “duplicative subway service” due to having “fewer train crews available while our employees follow steps that health officials recommend for everyone.” That means no B, W, or Z train service on Tuesday. The announce comes as the MTA is cutting service at a rate nines-times greater than usual, NY1 reports:
There are currently at least 23 MTA employees with confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The New York International Auto Show was supposed to open at the Javits Center on April 10. Instead, the massive glass complex will soon be home to four emergency hospitals constructed by FEMA, each with 250 beds. Another 1,000 beds, set up by the Army Corps of Engineers, will be available for hospital overflow.
“You are going to see an overcapacity of our health system,” Cuomo said during a tour of the facility Monday. “Luckily, Javits has plenty of space.”
Toured the Javits Center today where FEMA has started work on a 1,000-bed temporary hospital to open next week.
Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said in a press conference Monday evening that the COVID-19 “attack rate” for the New York City metro area, including New Jersey and parts of Long Island, is five times greater than the rest of the nation. Roughly 28 percent of tests in the metro area have come back positive for COVID-19, while that’s true of just 8 percent of tests around the U.S.
“Clearly, the virus had been there for a number of weeks,” she said. “To all of my friends and colleagues in New York, this is the group that needs to absolutely social distance and self-isolate at this time.”
Putting New York’s outbreak in context
Well over half of the confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases have been discovered in New York. As of Monday, cases in the state account for 58 percent of cases nationwide, and including 33 percent of the U.S. deaths from the disease.
The state has also done more testing for the virus than any other state — 78,000 tests and counting as of Monday, according to Governor Cuomo, compared with a little more than 26,000 tests done in California as of Saturday.
As of Monday, New York City’s more than 12,300 COVID-19 cases accounted for more than 58 percent of the state’s overall cases. And a total of nearly 8,000 cases have been discovered in the counties surrounding the city.
New York currently has more confirmed coronavirus cases per capita than Italy. If the state were a country, it would have more cases than every other country in the world other than Italy, Iran, China, Spain, and Germany.
New York City’s outbreak chart
As of Monday morning, nearly half of the confirmed coronavirus cases in New York City have been in people younger than 45 years old, and 57 percent of the people with confirmed cases have been male.
Cuomo orders hospitals to increase capacity by 50 percent
Governor Cuomo said Monday that he had issued an emergency order directing New York hospitals to expand their capacity by 50 percent. “Find more beds, use more rooms,” Cuomo said at his Monday press conference, “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say try to reach a 100 percent increase but you must reach a 50 percent increase.”
So far, roughly 13 percent of New York coronavirus cases have resulted in hospitalization, and as of Monday morning, 2,635 COVID-19 patients were being cared for in New York hospitals — including 621 in intensive care. But health officials believe the state will need as many as 113,000 hospital beds to handle the outbreak — more than double the current capacity of 53,000 beds. Even worse is the projected ICU unit shortage: health officials have said the state may need as many as 18,000 to 37,000 intensive care units for COVID-19 patients, but there are currently only 3,000.
On Sunday, Cuomo announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was building four temporary hospitals inside the Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, and another three in the New York City suburbs. The USNS Comfort hospital ship is also on its way to New York.
The number of known COVID-19 cases in the NYPD nearly doubled over the weekend, with officials confirming 98 cases on Sunday, up from 52 Friday. “In one Brooklyn precinct, the entire detective squad called out Sunday,” the New York Post reported. The number of officers calling in sick is roughly 1,000, double the average. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea told the Post that the department has enough officers and staff to absorb the absences, at least for now.
On Sunday, Governor Cuomo called on Trump to “order factories to manufacture masks, gowns, ventilators, the essential medical equipment that is going to make the difference between life and death.” (The president can do so via the Defense Production Act, which he’s so far been hesitant to invoke.) After Cuomo and other governors critiqued Trump or asked him to ramp up federal response efforts, Trump said that they should stop “blaming” his administration “for their own shortcomings.”
U.S. Army building four temporary hospitals
Governor Cuomo said Sunday that he had approved the building of temporary hospitals at four downstate locations by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Those locations will be the Javits Center in Manhattan as well as sites in Stony Brook, Westbury, and Westchester.
Governor Cuomo gave city leaders 24 hours to come up with a plan to limit the use of public parks on Sunday. Cuomo said he was “appalled” at the number of people who were congregating in the city’s parks on Saturday. “There is a density level in New York City that is wholly inappropriate,” Cuomo said at his Sunday coronavirus press conference, noting that he saw people playing basketball and shopping in open-air markets:
“The City has already banned team sports and revoked all permits for large gatherings and has increased the presence of NYPD and Parks Enforcement Patrol officers to enforce social distancing,” a city spokesperson told Gothamist. The Parks Department says it has been cleaning and disinfecting park facilities to control the spread of COVID-19, but that doesn’t currently include regular cleaning of outdoor furniture and playground equipment.
The Board of Correction asked city leaders in a letter on Saturday to begin immediately releasing some of the roughly 7,000 people currently in custody in New York City jails — particularly those in custody at highest risk of dying from the coronavirus. The BOC, which oversees the city’s jail system, said that in the past week it has learned that at least 17 employees of the Department of Correction and Correctional Health Service had tested positive for COVID-19 as well as at least 21 people being held throughout the city’s jail system. Fifty-eight people in custody were also being monitored in the contagious-disease and quarantine units.
“It is likely these people have been in hundreds of housing areas and common areas over recent weeks and have been in close contact with many other people in custody and staff,” the board said. “Given the nature of jails (e.g., dense housing areas and structural barriers to social distancing, hygiene, and sanitation), the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is certain to rise exponentially.”
Have underlying health conditions
The Legal Aid Society has also sued the city to release 116 parole violators with underlying health conditions who are in custody.
One of the reported deaths from the coronavirus in New York was a DOC investigator, who died last week. In addition, on Saturday, the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported the first inmate case of COVID-19 at the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.
All flights to and from airports in the New York City area and Philadelphia were temporarily halted on Saturday for about two hours after the FAA learned an air-traffic-controller trainee had tested positive for the coronavirus. The trainee last worked at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center in Ronkonkoma on March 17, and the FAA shut down travel to the region while the center was cleaned.
New York City restricts testing to preserve medical supplies
In an effort to preserve dwindling medical equipment and testing supplies, the New York City Department of Health has directed city health-care facilities to stop testing for the coronavirus for anyone who is not hospitalized.
“At this point in the pandemic, demand for unnecessary testing is contributing to the rapidly diminishing supply of PPE and leading to a decreasing supply of swabs and viral transport media used to collect diagnostic specimens for COVID-19 testing,” the department said in a statement. “Testing may play a more significant role after the pandemic has peaked.”
Life during the coronavirus pandemic
In Intelligencer’s first installment of a weekly poll about how the coronavirus crisis is affecting our readers, more than 1,000 people weighed in with their thoughts, fears, and how often they are leaving their homes:
[F]for low-income families (about 73 percent live in poverty), 114,000 homeless students, undocumented students, and English-language learners, school closures are a cataclysmic event. It isn’t that those impacted wish for schools to remain open during a pandemic, but the realities of life without a safe place for kids to go and learn reveal how integral the school system is for New York City’s most vulnerable and how so many social safety-net measures are tied to it.
On Friday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a Major Disaster Declaration for New York — opening up billions of dollars in federal disaster aid for the state as it tries to handle the country’s largest known coronavirus outbreak.
With Governor Andrew Cuomo's mandate that everyone in New York stay home, excluding essential services, here are what the state is calling "PAUSE Provisions." #coronavirus
On CNN Friday morning, Mayor de Blasio said the Trump administration needs to step up and help the city, which now has nearly a third of the nation’s cases of COVID-19. “I have made repeated appeals to the federal government to get us basic medical supplies, and there is no meaningful response,” he said. “Where the hell is the federal government in the middle of the biggest crisis we’ve seen in generations?”
On MSNBC, he said the Feds have sent New York City expired medical supplies. He also renewed his call for a shelter-in-place order in New York City, something that Governor Cuomo must order but has so far resisted. Citing an order given by California governor Gavin Newsom, who told the state’s 40 million residents to stay at home Thursday, de Blasio said, “What the State of California did was a recognition of a necessity.”
Governor Cuomo announced more than 1,700 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, a jump that comes as testing is expanded around the state. Cuomo said the state processed tests for more than 7,500 people Wednesday night and that 22,284 people total have been tested in New York. Of those who’ve tested positive, 777 have been hospitalized, a 19 percent hospitalization rate.
In his remarks, Cuomo said the outbreak “reminds me of 9/11.” He continued: “Children who were young at that time, but of school age, watched on TV. They didn’t know if their parents were coming home. I think it changed their whole outlook on life after 9/11. This is a situation like that.”
New York businesses are now required to keep at least 75 percent of their workforce at home, Governor Cuomo said Thursday. He also announced that mortgage payments will be waived for 90 days for people financially hurt by the outbreak. “If you are not working, if you are working only part time, we are going to have the banks and financial institutions waive mortgage payments for 90 days,” he said. “That will be a real-life economic benefit. It will also be a stress reliever for many families.” Fees for ATM overdrafts will be waived and foreclosures will also be suspended, he said.
“We’re writing to let you know that a positive case of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was found at our facility today,” a Wednesday text to workers at the Amazon warehouse in Queens read, according to The Atlantic. Workers were sent home so that the facility could be disinfected, as the company faces a surge of orders as Americans stuck at home turn to the e-commerce site en masse. Two office workers in Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle have already tested positive, though this is the first case among hourly warehouse workers who handle goods directly.
The New York Times reported of an Italian-American family based in Freehold, New Jersey, in which a 73-year-old grandmother, Grace Fusco, died on Wednesday night from the infection. Hours before, her son, Carmine Fusco, passed away from the virus. Five days before that, her daughter, Rita Fusco-Jackson, succumbed to the virus. Grace Fusco did not know that two of her children had died before her. In total, six of her children tested positive for the coronavirus; three of them are still in critical condition.
Naval hospital ship to anchor in New York Harbor — eventually
The USNS Comfort, a 1,000-bed naval hospital ship, is on its way to New York City, Governor Cuomo said Wednesday. The 894-foot ship, which will be moored in New York Harbor, will add to the hospital capacity in the city, where there are only 53,000 hospital beds. Cuomo has said the city could need more than 100,000 beds when infections peak in 45 days.
The announcement comes after Mayor de Blasio called for the U.S. military to take a bigger role in combating the outbreak in the nation’s largest city. “The military has extraordinary medical capacity,” he said on the Today show. “It’s needed in places like New York right now.”
Breaking: The Comfort hospital ship won’t be able to go to NYC for weeks, @ChiefPentSpox says. Ship is in maintenance in Norfolk, Va., and Pentagon is now expediting maintenance
NYC adding 8,200 hospital beds, faces ventilator shortage
The city is moving to rapidly add 8,200 beds to local hospitals through a combination of “retrofitting facilities that have nothing to do with health care” and carving out new space in existing hospitals by postponing elective surgeries and discharging patients early, Mayor de Blasio said Monday night. The city will also be opening five drive-up facilities for health-care workers to be tested for the coronavirus.
Setting up hospital rooms is one thing, but having enough ventilators for them is another. According to a 2015 report from the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, “New York could be short by as many as 15,783 ventilators a week at the peak of the crisis,” the Times reports.
“Everyone in New York should assume that they have been in contact with COVID-19”
New York City officials briefed United Nations diplomats on Saturday that the coronavirus has spread throughout the city, could threaten residents through late September, and that “everyone in New York should assume that they have been in contact with COVID-19,” according to Foreign Policy.
As Intelligencer’s Adam K. Raymond noted in his write-up on the product launch, “NYS Clean” doesn’t just address a supply shortage during a public-health emergency, cost a little more than $6 a gallon, and make a good backdrop for a press conference — it can also be used to threaten corporations:
Initial reporting stated that NYS Clean is manufactured by inmates at Great Meadow Correctional Facility in Washington County, who reportedly make roughly $0.65 an hour and may not be able to use the sanitizer themselves — because it contains alcohol. But Vice News reported on March 25 that inmates at Great Meadow “are doing nothing more than taking existing hand sanitizer and rebottling it into packaging labeled NYS Clean.”

Senate Reaches Deal on $2 Trillion Coronavirus Stimulus Bill
In the wee hours of Wednesday morning, after lots of wrangling and threats and a premature celebration by the stock market, congressional and administration negotiators reached an agreement on a $2 trillion emergency relief package to counter the immediate and long-term economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The bill was initially modeled on a Republican plan that focused on getting onetime relief checks out to individuals along with massive loans for endangered companies. But congressional Democrats managed to secure a number of improvements, most notably oversight for the corporate relief, direct aid for hospitals ($130 billion) and state and local governments ($150 billion), and beefed-up (an extra $600 per week) and extended (four months) unemployment insurance benefits.
While House Democratic and Republican leaders participated in the negotiations and presumably signed off on the final product, the House is not currently in session, and given coronavirus fears, many members would prefer to keep it that way and enact the stimulus bill by unanimous consent or a voice vote. The odds are low that all 435 members will agree to the bill (scattered objections are likely to come from both the left and the right), but a voice vote might accommodate both dissension and quick passage without a formal reconvening of the chamber. The possible post-negotiation evolution of the bill’s provisions in the Senate, however, could cause problems in the House.
Now attention can shift back to the pandemic itself, with jittery lawmakers monitoring their own health (three members of Congress and multiple staff have tested positive for COVID-19) and the adequacy of their hasty relief efforts.

CORONAVIRUS
Boris Johnson Tests Positive for the Coronavirus
The U.K. prime minister, whose government fumbled its initial response to the pandemic, says his symptoms are mild.
Over the last 24 hours, President Trump has aggressively widened the circle of people or countries that are making it impossible for Donald Trump to handle the coronavirus. In a Thursday night interview with Sean Hannity, Trump complained about Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer (“She is a new governor and it’s not been pleasant”), Washington governor Jay Inslee, and the demand by various hospital staff for more ventilator machines (“You know, you go to major hospitals, sometimes they’ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they’re saying, ‘Can we order 30,000 ventilators?’”). Today, on Twitter, he added General Motors CEO Mary Barra (“Always a mess with Mary B.”)
Trump happens to be enjoying his highest approval ratings at the moment. It is possible he will somehow maintain, or even enhance, his current standing. But his handling of the coronavirus — even from the narrow perspective of politics, which is how Trump himself views it — is doing almost everything to ensure that his bump is short-lived, and will eventually be followed by a long, steep decline.
Trump’s recent polling bump is real. The important context, though, is that every leader is getting approval bumps, and almost all of them are getting much bigger ones than Trump. In France, Emmanuel Macron’s approval is up 13 percent. In the UK, Boris Johnson — who arguable bungled the crisis worse than Trump did, originally proposing to let the virus run its natural course before admitting he had miscalculated and reversing himself — has seen his job approval soar from about even to two-to-one in favor. (Even Jeremy Corbyn’s net approval is up ten points.) The government in Italy, currently enduring the worst coronavirus outbreak anywhere, has soared from net negative to over 70 percent approval. In the United States, more than 70 percent of Americans approve of the job their state’s governor is doing to handle the coronavirus.
It is very easy to imagine a combination of medical improvement (the deployment of effective testing or treatments) or a V-shaped economic recovery that positions Trump for reelection in the fall. If that happens, however, almost nothing Trump is doing will have contributed to that outcome.
Trump’s strategy, to the extent that he has one, has been focused entirely on the short term. His goal is to reopen businesses as soon as possible. Of course, all things being equal, a fast return to normal activity would be better than a slow one. But the countries that have enjoyed success have done so by implementing wide-scale testing and tracing that allow them to isolate cases. Trump seems to believe he can relax restrictions in parts of the country that have not yet suffered widespread outbreaks.
It may be true that high-density cities have suffered much faster outbreaks. It is not true, as Trump implies, that the lagging pace of the virus in red states is caused by superior Republican governance. Red states are not identifying patients with coronavirus and putting them in quarantine. They are experiencing the same unchecked community spread as blue states, and while the virus has taken hold more slowly, they are catching up rapidly. As Nate Silver points out, “Nine of the 10 states that have seen the most rapid increase in coronavirus from Monday to Thursday are states that voted for Trump in 2016.”
Trump’s plan to relax social distancing in the states with the lowest levels of reported outbreak — without yet having widespread, fast-working tests in place — is a recipe to extend the outbreak and delay the recovery he craves.
He may well be persuaded to abandon his plans to do so. (Dr. Anthony Fauci is certainly working to dissuade him.) But that leaves open the question of just what Trump will gain by repeatedly promising the country that social distancing will end soon, and the recovery will be rapid. Rather than prepare the country for a long, painful road to return to normal, he has ramped up expectations to a level even a highly competent president would have trouble meeting.
Trump’s management of the coronavirus has been shambolic. Even the superficial communication of his management has been a disaster. His present, very modest high-water mark in polling is a reservoir of goodwill that he is rapidly squandering. If he winds up winning reelection, it will be in spite of everything he has done so far.

Pandemics Are a Great Reason to De-carcerate
Earlier this week, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced a plan to address statewide shortages of hand sanitizer: Manufacture the stuff in-house. As of Monday, an estimated 100,000 gallons a day is being produced locally and distributed to schools, the MTA, and other government agencies, he said at a press conference. He even performed a sample test. “I detect lilac, hydrangea, tulips,” the governor remarked, smelling his hands. The news was a welcome reprieve for anxious New Yorkers. But if Cuomo’s review is accurate, then all three flora also mask the stench of prison exploitation. The product is being bottled and packaged by incarcerated people across New York under the label of Corcraft Products — the “brand name” for the Division of Correctional Industries, according to WNBC. Under the pretense of job-skills training, prisoners are being made to manufacture these and other goods at a fraction of cost. The result is a potentially life-preserving health-care tool that many of them would likely be denied should the circumstances arise.
In communities across the United States, the new coronavirus strain and resulting pandemic have led to frantic stockpiling of food and medicine, school and workplace closures and — for the extra precautionary-minded — severe social isolation measures. Even so, experts are still predicting infection figures in the millions, with disproportionately high fatality rates among the elderly and the immunocompromised. People of all ages and health levels are being encouraged to wash their hands regularly, use hand sanitizer when that’s not possible, and to generally maintain clean living spaces and physical distance from one another to stem the virus’s spread. It’s a situation that’s perfectly designed to prey on the vulnerabilities that plague America’s carceral apparatus — a system of unprecedented breadth and cruelty, built over decades of fanatical punitiveness and inhumane neglect. If the daily torture that is jail and prison life isn’t a self-evident argument for the system’s dismantling, then the dangers posed to inmates by a pandemic outbreak certainly should be.
New York’s arrangement is just one cartoonishly stark manifestation of the inequities that persist systemwide. Due in large part to their dismal and bloated conditions, America’s correctional facilities are uniquely at risk to suffer the ravages of a deadly virus. They are enclosed spaces filled with people who can’t go anywhere else and have limited means of protecting themselves. The typical correctional facility categorizes hand sanitizer as contraband, and its possession a punishable offense. Access to running water is often a luxury. Restrictions on movement make washing one’s hands regularly almost impossible. The same goes for showering, social distancing, and voluntary self-quarantines among the symptomatic; some prisons are so overcrowded, and so lacking in basic amenities, that inmates are forced to sleep side-by-side on floors with no mattresses alongside rats and other vermin.
The extent to which such habitats accommodate illness is hard to overstate. Chronic medical conditions abound. Understaffed and overmatched health-care providers spell inadequate care with regularity — and, in some cases, craven efforts to avoid providing care altogether. In Alabama, some local jails issue “medical bonds” to sick detainees, releasing them expressly so that they don’t have to cover their health-care costs. These problems aren’t exclusive to jails or state prisons. Related hygiene issues arise in immigrant detention camps in states like Texas, where reports of incarcerated children wearing mucus-caked clothing being denied soap, toothpaste, and the ability to bathe made headlines last year.
These constitute prime conditions for a devastating viral outbreak. And the potential death toll is tied directly to Americans’ zeal for locking people up. COVID-19’s lethality is largely dependent on the age of the infected, with older victims the most at risk. Over the past several decades, as local and federal legislation has made prison sentences longer, the share of older inmates has skyrocketed; the number of incarcerated people age 55 or older grew 400 percent between 1993 and 2013, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. This is especially incongruous because of how age correlates with the recidivism risk that carceral zealots claim to be protecting people from. The likelihood of re-offending is lower among inmates over 60 than for any other age group. As such, prisons have increasingly adopted the profile of nursing homes. But so far, the precautionary measures taken by most facilities seem to entail only harsher restrictions.
Most have closed themselves to in-person visitors — a likely public-health necessity to avoid the virus infiltrating their walls. But this comes with devastating consequences for populations that have already been targeted for a lifetime’s worth of them. Contact with loved ones is often a mental health imperative; contact with attorneys can be a legal one. And due in part to the increasing privatization of prison communications, making phone calls to the outside can be exorbitantly expensive. The result is still a captive population subjected to routinely torturous conditions, but with narrowing means of even limited contact with the outside world.
It’s cruelty by design. Now imagine the disastrous potential of exacerbating these conditions with a viral sickness that even the best-equipped medical professionals on the outside have been unable to stop. Reports abound regarding how coronavirus is poised to wreak special havoc on the lives of the vulnerable. But that doesn’t mean that Americans are helpless. This goes double for elected officials, over whom the citizenry can exercise at least some leverage. More than perhaps ever before, keeping as many people out of jails and prisons as possible is as much a public-health concern as a moral one. Police and sheriff’s departments could meet it by arresting fewer people and executing fewer warrants, particularly for crimes that don’t constitute an immediate and demonstrable public-safety risk. Prosecutors, who have vast discretion over such matters, could limit the number of people cycling in and out of courts and jails — thus eliminating the “churn” whereby potentially infected people are constantly being shuffled in and out — by charging fewer of them and declining to incarcerate those whose sole impediment to freedom is their inability to pay bail.
And on the state and federal levels, governors and President Trump could use their practically limitless commutation powers to get the sick and elderly out of prison. The latter has already tried to use his as a political cudgel ahead of the 2020 election; using it to prevent further coronavirus outbreaks would be at least as noble. If they don’t act, a pandemic that’s already sent much of the country’s free population scurrying risks morphing into nothing short a humanitarian disaster inside its jails and prisons. Decades of conditioning have primed Americans not to care what happens to the incarcerate after they’re locked away. Rectifying that today would affirm our humanity at least as much as it would protect that of our imprisoned counterparts.

Coronavirus Means Less Air Travel, But With More Flexibility
I wrote last week that coronavirus was taking a large and uncertain toll on the travel industry. While the biggest hits to the airline sector had been reductions in travel to and within Asia, we’re starting to see falling demand for air travel and service cutbacks at airlines around the world. British Airways announced Monday it is reducing its frequency of service between London and New York — two places not yet hit especially hard by the epidemic. And United Airlines announced Wednesday that it is cutting its U.S. and Canada schedule by 10 percent for the month of April, and its international schedule (excluding Canada) by 20 percent, compared to its pre-coronavirus plans.
Another sign that both business and leisure bookings are soft is that all major U.S. airlines have greatly increased flexibility for customers to change and postpone travel plans without paying fees, even if the tickets are for travel to places not particularly impacted by coronavirus. (The one exception is Southwest, which isn’t granting new flexibility because its ticketing policies have always been unusually flexible, allowing passengers to change their tickets with no penalty beyond paying the difference between the old and new fare.) These are the sorts of moves you would expect from airlines that think they’re losing customers who are nervous about whether they will really want to travel.
If you want to take advantage of this added flexibility, you should review the policy of the specific carrier you’re buying a ticket on. For example, Delta will waive the fee for one change on any flight itinerary you book in the month of March (your planned travel doesn’t have to be this month, you just have to buy the ticket this month). United’s policy is more flexible: You not only have the option to change your itinerary without a fee; you can also cancel it and receive a credit that you can use toward any booking within a year of when you originally bought the ticket. That’s a better deal if you’re unsure exactly when you’ll want to reschedule your trip at the time of cancellation. American, on the other hand, is more restrictive than Delta: They will allow fee-free changes only up to 14 days prior to travel, which may not help you very much if you are concerned that COVID-19 may lead you to want to cancel close to your travel date. American’s announced policy also applies so far only to tickets sold through March 16, not the entire month, though they could extend it later. Points blogger Gary Leff attributes this restrictiveness to American’s desire to ensure that business travelers, whose schedules change frequently, can’t take advantage of cheap advance-purchase tickets.
Offering more flexible terms to passengers (a step that JetBlue took first before the larger carriers copied them) is a plausible strategy to boost ticket sales at a time when customers are concerned that coronavirus might become a really big deal, but they remain willing to fly as of today. It won’t do much for the airlines if and when we come to a point in the epidemic where social-distancing measures make reducing air travel a necessity in the U.S. — as then customers can be expected to extensively take the airlines up on the option to postpone and cancel. If that happens, you can expect even more schedule reductions. But for now, the airlines’ change in pricing strategies provides an option for you to plan upcoming travel with an option to cancel later, if you get nervous.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson: “Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus. I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus. Together we will beat this.”
What’s Good, Bad, and Mediocre in the Coronavirus Stimulus Bill
To combat the coronavirus and its economic side effects, Congress has assembled an economic rescue package about five times the size of Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus. The legislation is vast, complex, littered with inscrutably worded giveaways to obscure constituencies, and, as of this writing, not 100 percent finished.
• Establish a new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that will provide workers who do not ordinarily qualify for unemployment insurance — such as freelancers, furloughed workers, and independent contractors — with a weekly payment equal to one-half of the state average unemployment benefit plus $600.
UI eligibles will receive their usual benefits + $600/week in Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.
Compared to nothing — or the GOP’s initial plan to give less money to poor Americans than to middle-class ones — this provision is good. It will single-handedly increase the annual income of the poorest fifth of Americans by 16.33 percent, according to the Tax Foundation. Compared to what House progressives had been pushing, however, it is lackluster. For example, the House Financial Services Committee’s chairwoman, Maxine Waters, had proposed providing all Americans with monthly $2,000 checks for the duration of the pandemic.
The coronavirus has afflicted state governments with a wide range of miserable symptoms. Their spending on Medicaid, hospitals, and pandemic response measures is climbing, while their revenues are collapsing and the interest rates of their debt inch upward.
The Senate bill will reportedly provide states with $150 billion in funding for defraying the cost of Covid-related expenses. Which is better than nothing. But the sum total is too low, and the restriction on the use of the funds is small-minded. The true cost of fighting Covid-19 can’t be measured exclusively in state spending on health care and public health. Enforcing lockdowns and social distancing requires states to forfeit massive amounts of expected revenue. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine earned accolades for taking early, proactive measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus in his state. But one consequence of those acts of responsible governance is that the Buckeye State’s Treasury is getting depleted fast. As a result, DeWine is now calling for 20 percent across-the-board cuts to Ohio’s budget.
Some may question the government’s entitlement to dictate terms to companies that accept its relief. After all, this crisis is not analogous to 2008. Unlike the Wall Street banks that reaped bailouts 12 years ago, the firms seeking aid today bear no direct responsibility for the catastrophe that threatens their survival. The state itself is arguably more culpable. After all, it was the federal government’s belated response to the burgeoning pandemic that forced state governments to effectively outlaw most forms of economic activity. So why shouldn’t Uncle Sam compensate the enterprises his own negligence has imperiled, at least in the form of no-strings-attached financial support?
It’s not a bailout for the coronavirus. It’s a bailout for twelve years of corporate irresponsibility that made these companies so fragile that a few weeks of disruption would destroy them. The short-termism and lack of capital reserves funneled record profits into a bathtub of cash for investors. That’s who’s being made whole, financiers and the small slice of the public that owns more than a trivial amount of stocks.
But this seems misguided in two respects. First, it does not seem realistic to expect corporations to maintain capital reserves large enough to survive an economic shock as vast and unprecedented as that which the coronavirus has unleashed. And second, it would be undesirable for corporations to hoard cash at that scale, anyway. The problem isn’t that corporations haven’t been sitting on enough money to survive a pandemic but that they’ve been spending their savings on executive compensation and dividends instead of on wages and productive investment.
The United States has become a grotesquely unequal society in which the top 0.1 percent of the population has commandeered as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent combined. This vast inequity in asset ownership compounds itself on an annual basis as corporations toss off dividends to those rich enough to own their shares. And economic inequalities inevitably translate themselves into political ones. It takes time and money to influence electoral campaigns and legislative processes. Corporations can easily shoulder the expense of effective political engagement; their median employee cannot.
For these reasons, it is very difficult to rewrite the plutocrat-friendly rules of our market economy in ordinary times. The lobbying prowess of big business, combined with our legislative system’s myriad veto points, conspire to frustrate all attempts at structural change. But the pandemic has temporarily shifted the balance of power between our society’s public, semi-democratic governing institutions (a.k.a. Congress) and its private, authoritarian governing institutions (a.k.a. corporations). Who cares how or why corporate America just got knocked on its back? The point is to take this precious opportunity to kick the wealthy while they’re down, which is to say, exploit their temporary weakness to secure fairer terms for workers, consumers, and taxpayers in our economy’s social contract.

Boris Johnson Tests Positive for the Coronavirus
The U.K. prime minister, whose government fumbled its initial response to the pandemic, says his symptoms are mild.
Inside a Brooklyn Hospital Right Now
From the moment he wakes up, Dr. Peter Shearer, the chief medical officer at Mount Sinai hospital in Brooklyn, spends his day thinking about coronavirus. As one of the hospital’s leaders, his job entails coordinating with the doctors, nurses, and technicians on the front lines of patient care, something that has gotten increasingly difficult as Mount Sinai tries to contain the spread among its own employees. Like every other hospital in the city, Shearer’s ER and ICU are now inundated with COVID-positive patients. With 10 to 15 percent of his staff now sick themselves and three to four COVID-19 deaths per day, Shearer says that it’s hard to imagine things being worse than they are now. And yet scientists still estimate that the virus won’t peak for another two to four weeks. As a testament to that, a 20-foot cooler truck is now parked right outside Shearer’s window, a mobile morgue meant to house bodies when the hospital’s facilities inevitably overflow. Shearer knows this is only the beginning, and so he and his Mt. Sinai Brooklyn colleagues have agreed to keep us updated on life inside the hospital. This is the first dispatch.
I wake up around five o’clock and I start thinking about coronavirus. I look at my phone to see which patients decompensated [organ or system failure resulting in an urgent change in vital signs] or coded [a failure of the heart or lungs requiring resuscitation] overnight. And then I start to think about what the hospital resources are and look at the current status of my inpatient units, and my ICUs — plural because we’ve created an extra one — and my emergency department. And then I start to try and figure out how we’re going to get through another day.
The number of very sick COVID patients coming in is tremendous. I don’t know if the word is exponentially or logarithmically, but the curve goes up steeply. It’s scary. Mount Sinai Brooklyn is a moderate-sized community hospital. We have 220 beds, we’ve planned a surge of up to 240 to 260. At the current moment I have 135 COVID-positive patients. There are probably another 10 or 15 that just don’t have test results back yet.  And they are sick. They are the ones who need to be admitted to the hospital. It’s a few debilitated elderly from nursing homes, but there’s a lot of patients who are between the ages of 40 to 60 who may have some underlying health problems like obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure, and their lungs are very inflamed. They go from being moderately sick to crashing and needing to put on ventilators very quickly.
I don’t think medical science has an understanding yet of why some people do so much worse than others. There are theories out there about the viral load and probably some genetic variation. It’s unclear. Certainly underlying things like diabetes and high blood pressure add to the equation. Smoking, lung disease, vaping absolutely doesn’t help. But I don’t think we know enough about the science of this yet to say what makes one person crash and burn when another person just has a fever and aches for a week.
The emergency department is just patient-to-patient lined up and packed in. It’s that awful picture you see of an overcrowded emergency department, just patient upon patient next to each other endlessly. It sounds like a low-level buzz of chaos. We have a no-visitor policy so that helps maintain a bit of control over things and allows a little bit of sanity, but it’s minimal. If every patient had one or two family members next to them, it would be unbearable.
Three weeks ago when we started to plan for this we came up with ideas like, This is the room that we’ll put a [seriously ill] coronavirus patient in. And then if there are a bunch of other patients, maybe four or five who are slightly sick, we’ll put them in this area where we close the door and keep them separate from everyone else. We were thinking about this room and that room. And now I’m up to 27 patients in my emergency department who are positive, waiting for beds in the hospital, and another 24 who are under evaluation. Those plans are ancient history now. In an ideal world, everyone has their own room, they would have negative pressure airflow and a face mask on and a dedicated nurse to care for them with a moderate ratio of patients. We can’t do that. No one can do that right now. Every hospital in New York is a variation of mine.
I would say 10 to 15 percent of the staff is out [sick with COVID]. Many of them have been tested, while some have just had symptoms and we know clinically that they’re positive. Some of the employees that are at higher risk for contracting the illness are our respiratory therapists. They’re putting people on ventilators and working around the part of the patient where they might get some aerosolized particles. They are uniquely skilled employees, and they’re dropping like flies. Normally I would have five on during a shift. I have two today, at the exact time I have more patients on ventilators than before.
I think we’re seeing three to four COVID deaths a day now. And that has changed in the past couple of days. There have been some younger people. The more upsetting things are the 50- and 60-year-old people are getting put on ventilators. They haven’t died yet. But there’s no treatment for this. We’re just giving supportive care to buy them some time, where we hope their lungs will heal. There’s no real improvement therapy. Everything you hear about things like Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) for the critically ill, it’s probably much less effective.
We’ve had some tragic situations. We’ve had two married couples where they’re both hospitalized. There was a couple in their late 80s. The husband died and his wife is in another ward of the hospital. They’re both isolated. We couldn’t even get her there. We have another married couple in their late 50s where one is doing much worse than the other and is on a ventilator. It’s very overwhelming.
People have compared this to the early days of HIV. It feels like I can imagine how that was, but the numbers are more now. If you went back to that time, it was predominantly the gay community and focused in certain geographic parts of the city. This is every single hospital in the city, multiple patients dropping their oxygen levels surprisingly fast and being put on ventilators with no way to make them better. I’ve been through the blackout. I’ve been through Sandy. I’ve been through the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. And this is different. 9/11 was a horrendous thing, but there was no impact like this on hospitals. Sandy, some hospitals were completely devastated, and it was horrendous and awful, but the weather got better. And you could start cleaning up. But this is just getting worse. I have never been in a war. It feels like a war.
From the governor’s office, and from the modeling I get through the Mount Sinai health system, the peak will be somewhere between two to four weeks from now. But it’s pretty fucking awful right now. To think that somehow it’s going to get worse is hard to imagine. The governor has charged us with doubling the capacity of our hospital.  I can put three people in rooms that should accommodate two. But I need nurses to care for them. It’s going to be tough.
I think conversations [about triage] will come into play in the next week or so. We don’t have medical therapy for this, all we have is supportive care. There are patients for whom that’s not going to save their life, it may actually add to their suffering. There are some patients who it’s not even really an option to put them on a ventilator. Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should. My father died in mid-December before this all started, at the age of 85. It was an acute perforation of his bowels. And in that situation, the doctor comes to you and says, “He’s dying and there’s nothing we can do, and we will make him comfortable and make sure that he doesn’t suffer.” And those are the conversations that we need to be having with patients and families now for whom ventilation is not an option.
We’re not quite there yet in terms of [choosing which patients should get ventilators over others], allocating resources. It’s hard to know, things change very quickly. There’s a document from the New York State Department of Health which has guidelines for how to allocate ventilator resources at the time of a pandemic. Basically, you give scores to patients based on how sick they are, and that helps you to assign a triage level to different people and then make those decisions of: I have one ventilator and two patients, which one am I choosing. Or: I have a 30-year-old in my ER and an 87-year-old in my ICU, and it gives you guidance to take the person in the ICU off the ventilator and give it to the 30-year-old.
I have a COVID-positive 41-year-old who just died about five minutes ago. I just got the message. He’s been in the unit for about a week. Initially he seemed to be doing better and then he didn’t. In terms of preexisting conditions, he had obesity and maybe some diabetes. Not a lot. We’re very tight on visitors, but they were able to get his wife up there a few times. It’s devastating. But I’m not the one at his bedside taking care of him, which would be our ICU director and the nurses. Among my people, people already know that for medical staff, the repercussions of this months and years down the road are going to be extreme. It goes back to the wartime analogy — people being in World War One being shell-shocked. Now you call it PTSD. It will be like that.

New Orleans Is Becoming a New Epicenter of the Coronavirus Outbreak

Louisiana announced its first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus on March 9. By that point, outbreaks of COVID-19 were already disrupting daily life in New York, Washington, and California, as the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. hit 1,000.
He was right. Two weeks later, Louisiana has seen 2,305 positive tests and 83 deaths from the coronavirus. The state also has the world’s highest daily average growth in cases, according to a study from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
“The case count is sobering,” Edwards said Wednesday. “This is a rapidly evolving and escalating public-health emergency. We have not begun to flatten the curve.”
Areas in and around New Orleans have been hit hardest. As of Wednesday night, the city had 827 confirmed cases and just 56 of 431 ICU beds available. Orleans Parish now has the highest number of deaths per capita of any county in the country.
“As far as fears it could be the next epicenter: I think that, unfortunately, I kind of think we are there,” Dr. Joshua Denson, a physician at Tulane Medical Center, told Fox News Thursday.
The situation is particularly bleak at one area retirement home. Lambeth House in New Orleans has seen 42 residents test positive for the virus and 11 die. Things have gotten so bad there that an expert in infection prevention and control has been dispatched from the CDC. Lambeth House isn’t alone — officials have identified six Louisiana nursing homes with clusters of infections.
As the picture has worsened in Louisiana, the governmental response has accelerated. On Monday, Edwards called on residents to stay home unless they need to perform essential tasks. On Tuesday, President Trump declared a major disaster in Louisiana, unlocking millions of dollars in federal funding. But on Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN that the state should have taken action a “little bit sooner.”
“I’m not blaming anyone on that,” he said, “but you get caught unaware because the nature of this outbreak … It putters along and you think you’re okay, then it starts to go up a little, and bingo, it goes up in an exponential way. That’s what’s happening in New Orleans now.”
In the attempt to diagnose why Louisiana, and New Orleans in particular, has been hit so hard by the virus, some experts are pointing to Mardi Gras, which drew to a close on February 25. The Times reports:
“I think it all boils down to Mardi Gras,” said Dr. F. Brobson Lutz Jr., a former health director of New Orleans and a specialist in infectious disease. “The greatest free party in the world was a perfect incubator at the perfect time.” …
Dr. Catherine S. O’Neal, an infectious disease specialist and chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, compared this year’s Mardi Gras to the infamous 1918 “Liberty Loan” parade in Philadelphia. That gathering took place in the midst of an influenza pandemic, packed 200,000 people onto city streets and likely contributed to Philadelphia’s grisly death toll, with more than 12,000 people dying within a six-week period.
Edwards supports the theory, too. “I happen to believe that people coming from all over the country and over the world that a fair amount of virus was seeded, if that’s the word,” he said this week.
If Mardi Gras sparked the outbreak in Louisiana, Tony Spell may help ensure it keeps going. The reverend at Life Tabernacle Church outside of Baton Rouge, Spell continues to hold large services in defiance of state orders to limit gatherings of more than 50 people.

CORONAVIRUS MAR. 27, 2020
Coronavirus Fears Spark Prison Strikes, Protests, and Riots Around the World
By many estimates, the United States is still weeks away from seeing the worst of the novel coronavirus. The illness’s rapid spread, along with expanded testing, are producing higher and more comprehensive infection counts, which currently outpace the rate increases seen in other hard-hit countries like Italy, Spain, and Iran. The death toll is climbing as hospitals become overwhelmed. Tuesday alone saw 13 COVID-19 fatalities at Elmhurst Hospital Center in New York, a city that’s become the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak. As a result, either by choice or official mandate, Americans have joined many of their counterparts the world over and shut themselves in their homes, making a common practice of stockpiling groceries and supplies and avoiding crowds in case things get worse before they get better.
A similar panic is being felt among the world’s incarcerated populations — only they have fewer options for protecting themselves. People in jails and prisons are especially vulnerable to the pandemic’s ravages. Crowded and often filthy conditions, paired with restricted access to soap, water, and hand sanitizer have made unavailable to them many of the precautions that experts say can stem the virus’s spread: social distancing, staying away from infected people, and maintaining fastidious personal hygiene. Yet even as the virus infiltrates the world’s correctional facilities, officials in many countries, including the U.S., have been perilously slow to implement emergency countermeasures, like large-scale decarceration. The result is millions of prisoners stuck in cages essentially waiting for the deadly illness to pick them off. Some have responded with among the few defenses left at their disposal: protests, strikes, riots, and escape attempts.
The result has been a global surge in dissent. Two weeks ago, nearly 1,000 prisoners escaped detention in the Brazilian state of São Paolo after authorities canceled furloughs and visits in an effort to stop the coronavirus from spreading. Rather than live under lockdown in de facto petri dishes, many decided their best option was to bolt; facilities that saw breakouts included prisons in Tremembé, Porto Feliz, Mirandópolis, and Mongaguá, according to the Guardian. Riots fueled by virus fears have similarly been reported in Peru and Chile, and resulted in five prisoners being killed by guards in Venezuela last week, according to the Washington Post. The deadliest so far have occurred in Colombia. At least 23 inmates were killed in clashes with prison authorities over the weekend, according to the New York Times. People locked inside La Modelo, a prison in the capital city of Bogotá, had been complaining about unhygienic conditions and inadequate measures taken by officials to protect them. Authorities denied the charges and characterized the violence as stemming from a “criminal” mass escape attempt. One inmate, Oscar Sanchez, described the crackdown that greeted them as “a massacre that until now has taken more lives than coronavirus in [this country].” (Columbia has 491 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and six deaths, but none inside La Modelo as of this writing.)
Since last week in France, more than two dozen prisoners have refused to return to their crowded cells after courtyard walks, citing coronavirus concerns. More coordinated actions are happening in the U.S. According to ProPublica, ICE detainees being held at the Hudson County Correctional Facility in New Jersey have gone on hunger strike, demanding access to soap and toilet paper. (In doing so, they join prisoners at two other immigration detention facilities in New Jersey carrying out similar protests.) And at New York’s Rikers Island jail complex, where more than 50 inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus, a department probe team — the jail equivalent of a SWAT unit — pepper-sprayed eight prisoners who refused to return to their cells over the weekend, The City reports. The prisoners were asking to be admitted to a jail clinic to get their temperatures checked. A fellow prisoner who handled food had recently been removed from their housing unit after exhibiting flulike symptoms. The unrest continued into the week, when two dormitories housing about 48 prisoners each refused to go to work or the mess hall in protest against their conditions.
Taken together, these actions vivify the terror and desperation being felt by prisoners — not just in the U.S. but worldwide. A mix of fanatical punitiveness and a callous disregard toward how much incarcerated people suffer under routine circumstances, to say nothing of during a pandemic, has made America’s jails and prisons into habitats of sustained torture. And they’re rivaled by conditions elsewhere. Many of Brazil’s prisons are so overcrowded and in such dismal condition that they experience deadly riots regularly — including two within the span of three months in 2019 that claimed more than 100 lives. Colombia’s prison system, which is similarly bloated, is at more than 150 percent capacity. Many of Venezuela’s prisons are marked by cells so packed and sparse and exposed to the elements that inmates sleep on floors, go without shirts and shoes to combat the oppressive heat, and often lack bathrooms. Indeed, there are few correctional facilities in the world that don’t pose a dramatically heightened risk for the spread of the coronavirus compared to what society outside of them is being exposed to. A crucial difference is that prisoners lack the same luxury of voluntary self-preservation. They are trapped and desperate. If authorities aren’t going to protect them as the virus takes its deadly toll, it’s no surprise that they’re protecting themselves.

Boris Johnson Tests Positive for the Coronavirus
U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson revealed on Friday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, telling the nation in a video that his symptoms were mild, consisting of “a temperature and a persistent cough” — and that he would continue to oversee his government’s response to the crisis as he self-quarantines. Johnson also thanked health-care workers and assured the country that it would get through the pandemic.
Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus.
I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus.
The British government has been among the slowest in the Western world to take drastic measures to combat the virus’s spread. As much of Europe instituted lockdown measures during the first half of March, Johnson’s team took a different route, initially insisting that its strategy for the outbreak, which involved building up “herd immunity” among the populace by allowing the virus to spread, meant there was no need to shut down society. After loud criticism from many corners, the government reversed course in a matter of days, and Johnson’s Twitter account now includes the hashtag “stay home save lives” next to his name.
The Prime Minister was the second huge name in British political life to fall ill in recent days; Prince Charles tested positive for the virus earlier this week.

CORONAVIRUS UPDATED FEB. 26, 2020
Why Hasn’t the U.S. Done More Coronavirus Tests?

As cases of COVID-19 continue to spike around the world, the CDC warned on Tuesday that Americans should prepare for the likelihood that the coronavirus will eventually spread here. Amid escalating outbreaks outside of China, it’s clear that there has been undetected transmission of the virus from countries with which the U.S. has not restricted travel. While there has not been a corresponding spike in cases within the U.S., many health experts are warning the coronavirus may already be here. That remains an unknown though — in no small part because the U.S. has done very little testing for the virus. And thanks to problems at the CDC, including the distribution of a faulty test kit for the coronavirus, it’s not clear when the country’s testing capacity will improve.
“We’re testing everybody that we need to test,” President Trump insisted on Wednesday during his first press conference on the coronavirus. He’s almost certainly wrong.
Also on Wednesday, the U.S. confirmed its first coronavirus case of unknown origin — providing the first evidence that the virus is spreading, undetected, inside the U.S. without any known, direct link to the original outbreak in mainland China. It may not be the first undetected outbreak, either. On Monday, the Washington Post reported that at one unnamed hospital in the U.S., clinicians were unable to test a patient who had developed coronavirus-like symptoms after returning from a trip to Singapore.
Across the country, some health-care facilities and public health laboratories have begun looking for alternative ways to test for the virus, including using imported tests or developing their own, but those efforts have faced regulatory delays. At the same time, the CDC guidelines on who should be tested for the coronavirus have not been expanded, even as the disease has spread around the globe.
How many people in the U.S. have been tested for the coronavirus?
According to the CDC, 445 people have been tested for the virus as of February 25, resulting in 15 confirmed coronavirus infections, including two cases resulting from person-to-person spread, and one case of unknown origin. Those totals only include cases detected and laboratory-tested inside the U.S. — not from people the U.S. has flown back from abroad, like the American passengers on the quarantined Princess Diamond cruise ship in Japan.
There is no centralized count of how many people are being monitored or have been asked to self-quarantine by local and state health officials around the country.
Not well. While the U.S. has tested less than 500 cases, U.K. health officials have conducted more than 7,100 coronavirus tests as of Wednesday, confirming 13 positive cases, and U.K. authorities have announced aggressive plans to test thousands more, including drive-thru coronavirus testing. South Korea, which is battling the largest known outbreak outside of China, already has drive-thru testing in place and the country’s health officials have already conducted more than 30,000 coronavirus tests — mostly within the last week. And just one province in Canada, Ontario, has already conducted more tests (629) than in the entire U.S.
The amazing doctors in Deagu here in South Korea sent us this. A picture of their new drive- thru coronavirus test facility. Such a clever idea and so quickly set up. #CoronavirusOutbreak (h/t @wj_bae )
Why have there been so few tests?
There are combination of factors limiting U.S. testing capacity, including guidelines limiting the surveillance and detection of potential coronavirus cases; an inadequate supply of coronavirus tests, due in part to regulatory hurdles; and ongoing problems at the CDC as it tries to develop and distribute an accurate test to the labs that need it.
As of Tuesday, only a dozen or so state and local health departments can currently test for the virus, and positive results still have to be confirmed by the CDC in Atlanta, according to Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Meanwhile, Politico reported last week that only three out of 100 public health laboratories in the U.S. could test for COVID-19, according to a lab industry official. Whatever the total number is, it’s clear that coronavirus test kits have not been made widely available to the hospitals and public health labs across the country that need them — and there is still no word on when that will change.
Retweeting my lab screening story I broke from last week. Most of it still holds. Azar said today 12 labs are verified, but I only have confirmed that five states have capabilities. Flu network is still being not screening negative flu samples for #COVID19. 
Screening efforts for the coronavirus in the USA are slow to start.
Only three public health labs have verified CDC's test, and a plan to use the flu surveillance network to test negative flu samples isn't up yet.
0/cdc-coronavirus-116529 
In addition, CDC guidelines only recommend testing people who are both showing symptoms of a respiratory illness and have either recently been to China or close to someone infected with COVID-19. Many health experts have called on the CDC to expand the guidelines, particularly now that China is far from the only country where the coronavirus has been spreading. The guidelines definitely made sense when China was the source of all known cases of the virus, but they haven’t been updated since.
Earlier this month, the CDC announced a large expansion of U.S. surveillance and testing for the coronavirus using health-care facilities and laboratories that were already part of the national influenza surveillance network the CDC uses to collect data about the seasonal flu. Public health labs across the country already test a few thousand patient samples per week as part of the program, so they would be in a good position to begin screening samples to look for the coronavirus. The CDC’s plan was to start testing coronavirus samples in five cities: Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, and New York City, then start expanding the testing to more parts of the country.
The CDC, with the FDA’s approval, had rapidly developed a test kit for the coronavirus, but after shipping it to state laboratories, additional testing of the kit determined that it had a faulty component and had to be scrapped. The CDC has been actively developing a new test kit since then, but no one seems to know when it will be finished and distributed. Messonnier, the CDC official, said on Tuesday that she thought the agency was “close” to being done with the new test.
Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who leads President Trump’s coronavirus task force, has denied that the CDC test malfunctioned. Azar and the CDC have vowed full transparency over the U.S. coronavirus response, but that has not been the case so far.
.@cdcgov just talked about their commitment to "radical transparency" during the coronavirus outbreak, but I've heard from lab directors who are eager to know what, exactly, is wrong with the test kits
There also remain questions about how budget and staffing cuts at the CDC under the Trump administration have impacted the agency’s capabilities. And there’s good reason to worry that the Trump administration may not always act in line with the agency’s guidance — there has already been at least one instance when the White House overruled the CDC in deciding how to handle confirmed coronavirus cases. On Wednesday, Trump directly contradicted the CDC in his first press conference on the coronavirus, noting that he didn’t think U.S. outbreaks were inevitable a day after the CDC had warned they were.
Infectious Diseases
Those who work for the CDC have always been incredibly dedicated to and knowledgeable about top notch public health. It's worth noting, hiring freezes and other pressures have not helped. 
When will the U.S. be able to ramp up its coronavirus testing capacity?
What are state and local health officials doing in the meantime?
According the Washington Post, hospitals and public health laboratories around the country have been scrambling to come up with alternative ways to test for the coronavirus, including importing tests from abroad or developing their own. But these efforts face serious obstacles:
The nation’s public health laboratories, exasperated by the malfunctioning tests in the face of a global public health emergency, have taken the unusual step of appealing to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to develop and use their own tests. In Hawaii, authorities are so alarmed about the lack of testing ability that they requested permission from the CDC to use tests from Japan. A medical director at a hospital laboratory in Boston is developing an in-house test, but is frustrated that his laboratory won’t be able to use it without going through an onerous and time-consuming review process, even if demand surges.
[U.S. authorities should] expand the types of diagnostic tests that can detect the virus. Right now the only test in use is one developed by the CDC. It is only conducted at CDC and at some public-health labs, which limits how many patients can be screened. The novel coronavirus has been declared a public-health emergency, which means that other tests from commercial and academic labs can’t be used without Food and Drug Administration approval.
The FDA could permit more labs to develop their own tests and also use manufactured diagnostic test kits that the labs can run on their existing platforms. The FDA can work closely with manufacturers of these kits, including large commercial labs, to make these tests more available under the agency’s emergency authority.
It’s also important to note that the CDC isn’t the only organization to have trouble developing an accurate test, and even the tests that work have to be conducted properly and at the right time, since there is evidence that some people infected with COVID-19 have tested positive after testing negative, because of the virus’s incubation period.
At the same time, state and local health jurisdictions have already been straining to handle even pre-outbreak workloads around the country. And coronavirus test kits aren’t the only critical resource in short supply.
Is there any evidence of undetected outbreaks in the U.S.?
Yes. On Wednesday night, the U.S. confirmed the first coronavirus case of unknown origin in Northern California — meaning health officials have found no link between the case and travel to China or exposure to another person who was infected with COVID-19. It is the first evidence that undetected community transmission of the coronavirus has been taking place in the America.
It is important to highlight, however, that as experts have pointed out, there does not seem to be any significant increase in the number of hospital patients with serious, unexplained lung infections. That’s the good news — for now. But as the CDC itself warned on Tuesday, it’s just a matter of time until new coronavirus outbreaks strike inside the country. Without adequate testing capacity, those outbreaks will be much more difficult to detect and contain.
This post has been updated to include President Trump’s comment on the testing and the news of the first confirmed coronavirus case of unknown origin in the U.S.

Boris Johnson Tests Positive for the Coronavirus
The U.K. prime minister, whose government fumbled its initial response to the pandemic, says his symptoms are mild.
So What Should I Do About Coronavirus Now?
“I hope it’s arborio rice,” my friend told me, after I said I had stocked up on rice and dried beans and lentils in preparation for a potential coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. (In fact, I did buy arborio rice, but that doesn’t mean you have to; advice ahead.)
I bought the rice in part because I had been asking myself a question I suspect a lot of you have over the last few days, as coronavirus outbreaks have spread outside China and the stock market has fallen nearly 7 percent based on the expectation that this thing is going to be disruptive for longer and over a wider geographic area than people had previously hoped: What should I do about this now, besides wait?
So I called up Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary of intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Homeland Security who now serves as faculty chair of the global health and security project at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. She’s a frequent guest on my radio show Left, Right & Center, and she’s who I call when I have questions about disasters.
“Preparedness for a pandemic is relatively the same as the preparedness that people like me have been urging on the American public since 9/11, whether it’s for a hurricane or an earthquake,” she said. The first rule of thumb she offers is that “the first 72 is on you”: If you can, you should have on hand what you would need to live self-sufficiently in your home for three days, as you wait for a government disaster response to ramp up. That’s food, water (a gallon per person per day), medication, diapers, pet food, etc. — and it’s why I bought the rice and beans. This is a good practice even if you’re not currently afraid that a pandemic is about to strike.
Besides having essential supplies, Kayyem noted that people should make sure they are up-to-date on their vaccines, including flu shots, because a community that is more resilient overall and less likely to get other diseases is going to be better positioned to handle a novel pandemic. And schools and employers should be preparing their plans for what they will do if the epidemic hits where they are located — what measures they will take to increase social distancing and reduce the spread of the disease, if and when it comes to that.
This led me to ask whether three days worth of supplies is enough. A pandemic, after all, is not a hurricane. I’m not imagining that I will be waiting for the government to reopen a damaged bridge or tunnel. I am imagining a situation where it’s inadvisable to leave my apartment, or perhaps if I do leave my apartment, the grocery store shelves are sparse because of panic buying, like we’ve seen in Milan, or supply-chain difficulties. Kayyem’s answer was, essentially, that protecting the flow of groceries will be a core government-disaster-response function. People are going to need food and other essential supplies, and a large majority of American households have not taken steps to put together a three-day preparedness kit, according to a 2015 survey from Chapman University. So three days is a floor, and it’s fine to have more — especially if you really like arborio rice, as I do. But it’s not going to be practical to expect people to hunker down in their homes until the epidemic is over — there’s going to have to be a supply chain that includes people leaving their homes, shopping for essentials, and working.
If and when it comes to social distancing, that will entail telling more workers to work from home if they can and canceling large events and social gatherings. Employers will need to take precautions to reduce essential workers’ risk of disease exposure. In some epidemic hot spots, there may be school cancellations. (This is precedented: As Kayyem notes, there were extensive school closures in Texas during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak.) But we are not at the stage yet where increased social distancing is necessary or advisable in the U.S., except in specific cases of people who may have faced a specific risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus. In fact, as I spoke with Kayyem, she was just getting off a transcontinental flight.
Kayyem said she would follow State Department travel recommendations as they change. Currently, the department is telling people not to travel to mainland China and discouraging nonessential travel to South Korea. It has more limited coronavirus-related warnings about travel to Japan and Italy, and it suggests reconsidering cruise plans within Asia. (There is also a CDC advisory about coronavirus in Iran; the State Department already warns against travel to Iran for unrelated reasons.) There is no blanket recommendation against traveling the world, except to specifically impacted places. Still, Kayyem is watching and waiting for the very real possibility of increased disruption to travel and events. She has plans to attend the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo for professional reasons; she thinks it is “fifty-fifty” that the Games will actually happen as scheduled.
As global stock markets have fallen sharply this week, travel-related stocks have been especially hard hit: airlines, hotels, travel agencies, cruise lines. These companies face several problems at once: major travel disruptions already occurring in Asia, concerns that those disruptions will spread globally, and fear that people will become less inclined to travel even in places not yet specifically affected by the epidemic.
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that only six percent of American households are compliant with government recommendations to hold three days of emergency supplies.

With more than 400 confirmed cases, Qatar has implemented a series of measures to help contain the outbreak.
Doha, Qatar - Qatar has stopped all incoming flights into the country, except cargo and transit passenger flights, in a bid to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
On Sunday, Qatar announced a financial package that will provide incentives amounting to 75 billion Qatari riyals ($23bn) to help support the private sector during the outbreak. 
As of Wednesday, Qatar has confirmed a total of 442 confirmed cases with no deaths reported.

"We used to see a lot of customers, including tourists from cruise ships. But that has stopped now. I don't think this will end any time soon. Maybe the virus outbreak will last a year. I hope not but no one knows," said Saad Ismail, a pearl seller. SORIN FURCOI/AL JAZEERA

What happens if you catch the new coronavirus?
It is becoming a bit of a mantra; we hear it whenever anyone is talking about the coronavirus: "The elderly and those with underlying health conditions are most at risk."
But what are these underlying health conditions we should worry about and does that mean that anyone with a long-term health issue is doomed to fall victim to the complications of Covid-19?
There is a good chance that even those who have underlying health conditions will make a full recovery from the virus, but they are at increased risk of complications such as shortness of breath, pneumonia, and in some cases, needing a machine and intensive hospital treatment to help them breathe. 
Does ibuprofen make coronavirus worse?
Coronavirus and your mental health
We are learning new things about the virus all the time but current evidence shows that people who have diabetes (of any kind) are most at risk of developing complications and needing intensive hospital care, followed by those with underlying heart conditions, then lung conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
So, in addition to washing your hands, practising "social distancing" and sticking to good overall hygiene measures, there are a few other things you can do to minimise your risk.
Here are some of the long-term health conditions we need to be concerned about.
Diabetes is top of the coronavirus risk list for a good reason - high levels of sugars in your blood can dampen your immune system. If your blood sugars have been poorly controlled for some time, this can cause the white cells that help fight off infection to become weaker and fewer in number, leaving you prone to catching infections as well as suffering from the complications of them.
Improving your diet by cutting down on carbohydrate-rich foods (bread, chapattis, potatoes and pasta, as well as cakes and sweets) and increasing your physical activity levels will help to bring your blood sugars down and help give your immune system the best possible chance of fighting off the coronavirus.
If you are self-isolating, there are simple exercises you can do at home. Brisk walks around the garden for 10 to 15 minutes a day and climbing the stairs a few times a day is enough to get your heart racing and get you breathing a bit harder - all of which will go some way to improving your physical health.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), heart disease is the number one cause of death worldwide for both men and women of all races. We must manage this as best we can during the coronavirus outbreak.
In my experience, people with high blood pressure or high cholesterol frequently fail to take their medication as prescribed because they do not always have any physical symptoms of either of those things.
If you are using your reliever inhaler more than two to three times per week, it would suggest your background lung health is not under control and you should speak with the clinician who manages your condition to see whether or not you need stepping up your treatment. 
Having good background lung health will go a long way towards reducing your risk of Covid-19 complications including severe respiratory problems and even pneumonia.

Islamabad, Pakistan - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has called upon his countrymen "not to panic" amid a spike in coronavirus cases in the country, warning that the spread of COVID-19 was inevitable and that Pakistan cannot currently afford the economic cost of shutting down its cities.
As of Wednesday, Pakistan has recorded at least 243 cases of the highly contagious coronavirus, most linked to travellers who have returned home from neighbouring Iran, according to government data. It is the highest number of confirmed cases in South Asia, compared with 147 in India, 44 in Sri Lanka, and 22 in Afghanistan.

"We thought that if we shut down our cities, then people are already suffering, if we save them from corona[virus] on the one side, on the other side they'll die of hunger," he said in a televised address to the nation late on Tuesday.
In an interview to the Associated Press news agency earlier this week, Khan called for the international community to consider a "debt write-off" for vulnerable countries that are dealing with the outbreak.

Separately, the country's Civil Aviation Authority issued a notice to airlines on Tuesday, requiring all travellers arriving in Pakistan from Saturday onwards to have paperwork certifying that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the last 24 hours.
More than 60 percent of Pakistan's cases can be traced to a quarantine camp established in the town of Taftan, on the Pakistan-Iran border in Balochistan province.
At least 149 people have tested positive after being released following a 14-day quarantine at that facility, according to government data. Those in quarantine at the Taftan camp told Al Jazeera their symptoms were not being adequately monitored, and they were not being screened.
More than 800 Sindh residents who are due to be released after a 14-day quarantine in Taftan will be put directly into a provincial quarantine camp, the provincial health ministry said.
Pakistan has, so far, only officially reported one case of secondary contact spread of the coronavirus, with officials saying cases have so far been limited to those with a travel history to countries where the virus has been detected.
On Tuesday, PM Khan said the government had ordered additional ventilators for hospitals to deal with an expected influx of patients as the virus spreads.
"This virus will spread. Please keep this in your mind, that we have to try our best," he said. "The way we are seeing in the world, countries with better medical systems, hospitals and strong institutions, it is spreading fast there. So know that it will spread here as well."

"We are chasing the coronavirus away in our prayer," she added with a laugh.
Mama Pinda and her friend, who brought her toddler along, stubbornly tried to defy the appeals to avoid crowded spaces amid a general atmosphere of hesitation in the streets that followed the announcement by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa of a series of drastic measures to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.

"Suddenly, South Africans jolted into action," said Professor Mosa Moshabela, from the School of Nursing and Public Health of the University of Kwazulu Natal. "And that is good," added Moshabela, who is convinced that the country's fighting chance against the new coronavirus is social distancing and precautious behaviour.
Now declared a pandemic, the outbreak of the new coronavirus that was first detected in China late last year has infected nearly 200,000 people in more than 150 countries.
COVID-19, the highly infectious disease caused by the virus, has so far killed almost 8,000 people, while more than 81,000 others have recovered. Across Africa, the number of registered infections has risen to 418 in 30 countries, while South Africa's government has been one of several in the continent to impose travel restrictions on European countries and the United States.
By Wedneday morning, South Africa had 116 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no deaths.
Despite the relatively low numbers, one of the main worries is what will happen once the virus reaches the crowded inner cities and townships.
"We must alert all South Africans that the internal transmission risk is now settling in," Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize said in a statement on Tuesday. "Once this infection starts spreading in taxis and buses, it will create a new dynamic."
COVID-19 infects people of all ages, but evidence to date suggests that older adults and those with underlying medical conditionsare at higher risk of becoming severely ill.
"We have seven million people that are HIV-positive, and two million are not on treatment," said Professor Susan Goldstein Public, a health specialist and deputy director of the Wits Centre for Health Economics and Decision Science.
Due to the disparate societal and demographic structure of South Africa, there is growing uncertainty about what may happen if the coronavirus is not contained.
"We also don't know how it plays out in very poor areas where there aren't places for quarantine - and bed-sharing is not possible," added Goldstein, who holds some hope that the strong private health sector may open to everyone.
"Then we may have enough beds. That is what the national health insurance is currently trying to achieve."
Dilapidated public health system
More than 25 years after the fall of apartheid, South Africa is still one of the most unequal countries in the world, which translates into the failure of delivering basic services to its people, including healthcare. Eighty-two percent of people living in South Africa have no health insurance and rely on public clinics and hospitals. These facilities are overcrowded and understaffed and often fall short of coping with the high amount of communicable and infectious diseases.
"We cannot contain COVID-19 with our health system alone," Moshabela said. "If we look at how Italy [Europe's coronavirus hotspot] is coping with the virus - we can't do it. We will be similar to that with the difference is that we don't have a big old population but a high number of people who have TB and HIV. Those who are going to be affected the most are going to be between 20 and 60."
Health professionals agree that only a drastic public health response can prevent the virus from spreading at a fast pace, warning that societal factors such as lack of access to information and lack of sense of empowerment - people often do not know where to seek help or what they can do to protect themselves - complicates the fight to contain COVID-19. 
In Bertrams, a low-income neighbourhood just east of Johannesburg's inner city, people started moving into the local supermarkets to equip themselves for what is coming. Shops and other places frequented by the public intensified hygienic controls. Some started wearing face masks.
Having believed a rumour that COVID-19 comes from eating meat, some people think they have to change their diets. On his way out of a local corner shop, a man proudly held up his plastic bag and announced that he is now buying fish. "Nyama [meat] gives you corona," he said.
False information shared in Whatsapp groups and other social media platforms perpetuate the confusion. "A Palestinian scientist has found the vaccine against corona" is one message circulating in the community groups. Another one reads: "Corona can be cured by boiling 8 tablespoons of garlic and 6 cups of water."
Information is an important factor to contain the virus, said Moshabela, whose university will remain shut as of Wednesday. On this last day, he called a meeting in the boardroom to inform the people about the reasons behind the measures that have been taken.

Timeline: How the new coronavirus spread
The new coronavirus causing the COVID-19 disease can survive on some surfaces for days or in the air for several hours, according to a new study.
Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on Tuesday suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was detectable for up to four hours on copper and two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, and up to 24 hours on cardboard.

What happens if you catch the new coronavirus?
Using a nebuliser to simulate a person coughing or sneezing, scientists from the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), University of California, Los Angeles and Princeton found that the virus became an aerosol, meaning its particles became suspended in the air, making it detectable for almost three hours.
The study was first posted on a medical pre-print website last week before it was peer-reviewed, and attracted much attention, including some criticism from scientists who said that it may have overstated the airborne threat.

The virus is predominantly transmitted by respiratory droplets and in this form it is viable for only a few seconds after a person coughs or sneezes.
SARS comparison 
The scientists found that the new coronavirus had similar levels of viability outside the body to its predecessor that caused SARS (or severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
This means that other factors such as greater transmission between people with no symptoms might be why the current pandemic is far greater than the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003.
A Chinese paper that was posted last week and is awaiting peer-review found an aerosolised form of the new coronavirus was present in the bathrooms of patients in a hospital in Wuhan, where the virus was first detected late last year, as the virus is shed in stools.
An aerosolized form of SARS was responsible for infecting hundreds of people in a Hong Kong apartment complex in 2003, when a sewage line leaked on to a ceiling fan creating a virus-laden plume.
The team behind the NEJM study performed similar tests on the SARS virus, finding the two viruses behave similarly.
Will warmer weather slow the spread of coronavirus?
But their similar viability fails to explain why the novel coronavirus pandemic has infected close to 200,000 people and caused almost 8,000 deaths, while the SARS epidemic infected about 8,000 and killed nearly 800.
"This indicates that differences in the epidemiologic characteristics of these viruses probably arise from other factors, including high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic," wrote the researchers.
The findings affirm guidance from public health professionals regarding social distancing, avoiding touching the face, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and frequently disinfecting objects using disinfectant sprays or wipes.

Indian authorities have said they will not expand coronavirus testing, as most affected nations are doing, despite criticism that limited testing could leave COVID-19 cases undetected in the world's second-most populous country.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to test as widely as possible to curb the pandemic, but India has only been testing those who have travelled from affected countries or come in contact with a confirmed case and shown symptoms after two weeks of quarantine.

On Tuesday, it added healthcare workers with symptoms who are treating patients with severe respiratory illnesses.
India is conducting only about 90 tests a day, despite having the capacity for as many as 8,000. So far, 11,500 people have been tested, according to The Associated Press.
Coronavirus cases in India rose to 147 on Wednesday [Rajanish KakadeAP Photo]
Officials have said the WHO guidance didn't apply in India because the spread of the disease has been less severe than elsewhere.
Balaram Bharghava, who heads the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country's top medical research body, said the guidance was "premature" for India, where community transmission has not yet been detected.
Last week, a British citizen who approached a public hospital in New Delhi for coronavirus test was told she was not eligible under India's testing criteria and turned away.
The woman, who requested anonymity fearing business consequences for her employer, said she told hospital officials that she may have had contact with an infected person in her hospitality sector job, but could not be sure.
After trying and failing to be tested a second time, she left India this week for France, where her family lives and where President Emmanuel Macron had announced extreme measures to curb the coronavirus.
Indian authorities have justified their restrictions as a way to keep a deluge of people from demanding tests that would cost the government money it needs to combat other diseases such as tuberculosis, malnutrition and HIV/AIDs.
ICMR said there was no need to expand such testing. However, authorities said they're preparing for community spread by bolstering their lab testing infrastructure. India has 52 coronavirus testing centres.
As a result of the narrow testing criteria, sick people with potential exposure to the coronavirus are being sent home, and some experts fear that India's caseload could be much higher than government statistics indicate.
Bharghava, the ICMR chief, said virus infections in India can still be traced back to people who travelled into the country from affected locales and that testing protocols would be revised if community transmission is detected.
Coronavirus cases in India rose to 151 on Wednesday, a day after a third person, a 64-year-old man, died in the western state of Maharashtra.
A total of 276 Indians have tested positive for coronavirus overseas to date, an Indian government minister said on Wednesday.
Authorities say most of the infections have been "imported" - linked to foreign travel or direct contact with someone who caught the disease abroad.
Travellers coming from or transiting through the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine when they arrive in India, the government announced on Monday.

"Given the pattern of disease in other places, and given our low level of testing, then I do think that community transmission is happening, " said Dr Gagandeep Kang, director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute.
WHO said that, while self-initiated isolation by people with mild symptoms remains the most important community intervention, testing of all suspected cases, symptomatic contacts of probable and confirmed cases, would still be needed.
"We need to be geared to respond to the evolving situation with the aim to stop transmission of COVID-19 at the earliest to minimise the impact. ... We need to act now," said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the WHO's director for the region.
More than 400 million of India's 1.3 billion people live in crowded cities, many without regular access to clean water, conditions that could allow the disease to spread rapidly.
"Community spread is very likely. But the only way to know for sure is through more expansive testing," said Dr Anant Bhan, a global health researcher in Bhopal, India.
The virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people, but severe illness is more likely in the elderly and people with existing health problems.
India has a lower proportion of elderly than other countries, but its healthcare facilities are limited and already struggle to accommodate the large number of patients with other diseases.
"This, along with our high population density, can be our great challenge," public health researcher Oommen Kurian told the Associated Press.
India has been reluctant to expand testing, not wanting to trigger panic and overwhelm hospitals, but also because of the cost: While the tests are free for patients, they cost the government about 5,000 rupees ($67) each.
In an already stretched and underfunded public healthcare system, money spent on the coronavirus leaves less for other public health problems. India spends only 3.7 percent of its total budget on health.
The coronavirus may also be spreading in India because health officials have struggled to maintain quarantines, with people fleeing from isolation wards, complaining of filthy conditions.
In Maharashtra, five people, one of whom had tested negative and the rest who were awaiting test results, walked out of an isolation ward last Saturday.

Enforcing containment
India has implemented a 19th-century epidemic law that empowers public officials to enforce more rigorous containment measures and impose penalties and punishments for escapes.
Lav Agarwal, a health ministry official, said authorities "often don't get enough support from people".
Aditya Bhatnagar, an Indian university student who was studying in Spain, described unsanitary conditions at an isolation ward where he and 50 others passengers on a flight from Barcelona have been kept since landing in New Delhi on Monday.
Bhatnagar said the rooms, each holding about eight people, lacked basic hygiene features such as clean bedsheets and bathrooms. He told the AP that the group, awaiting their COVID-19 test results, was not provided with masks or sanitiser.
"I don't think these measures would be enough to contain the pandemic," Bhatnagar, the ICMR chief, said, adding that some passengers had opted to move from the wards and into private hotels, paying 4,000 rupees ($55) a night to self-isolate for at least 14 days.

Italy posts more grim coronavirus records as deaths, cases rise
Rome, Italy - As coronavirus cases jump and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an "enormous" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel.
At least 2,629 health workers have been infected by coronavirus since the onset of the outbreak in February, representing 8.3 percent of total cases, according to a report published on Wednesday by Gruppo Italiano per la Medicina Basata sulle Evidenze or GIMBE - Italy's Group for Evidence-based Medicine.

Coronavirus: Which countries have confirmed cases?
What happens if you catch the new coronavirus?
The data has sent shock waves through the country's already strained healthcare system.
"We extracted this number from data provided by the National Health Institute," GIMBE Director Nino Cartabellotta, a public health expert, told Al Jazeera.
"Figures regarding the contagion among doctors, nurses and general health professionals have started being disclosed only on March 11. Hundreds of new cases have been daily recorded since then. But medical personnel on the front line should be the first to be protected."
Cartabellotta said the actual number was likely to be higher because healthcare workers are not always  tested and protection measures at hospitals were inadequate.
Many who tend to coronavirus patients are still only using surgical face masks with no proper protective filters to shield them from contagion.
The percentage of health workers infected in Italy is almost double the number registered throughout the epidemic in China, during which a total of more than 3,200 people died.
According to figures published in JAMA Network Open, an online medical site from the Journal of the American Medical Association, infected medical staff in China made up 3.8 percent of the total cases, with only five deaths.
Over 60 percent of the medical staff who were infected were registered in the epicentre's outbreak, Wuhan.
On Wednesday, Italy announced that over the preceeding 24 hours, the number of deaths had risen by 475 to 2,978, an increase of 19 percent, as cases jumped to a total 35,713.
There are no official figures on the number of medical personnel who have died of coronavirus in Italy.
According to Italian daily Corriere della Sera, a general practitioner from the province of Lodi died on Wednesday. This raised the death toll of family doctors in the area to four. Other regions have also registered losses among medical staff.
A lack of equipment, resources and personnel has piled pressure on Italy's health system. 
Italy does not produce masks. With the pandemic spreading, some of its closest neighbours have been reluctant to export supplies they may need soon.
"The problem right now is the supply of the protective gear," Cartabellotta said. "The government should have thought of this some time ago. It is logical that following the global explosion of the pandemic, countries producing masks and other protective devices are now keeping them to themselves and stopped their exports.
"We already have a limited number of doctors and nurses. Under extreme circumstances, we could even ask them to keep working even if [they] tested positive for coronavirus. Still, they should be equipped with protective devices to avoid spreading the virus further."
An emergency decree presented by the government on Monday allocated 3.5 billion euros ($3.8bn) towards the ailing health system.
"We are importing medical personnel from abroad and throwing new young healthcare professionals without licenses into the fray," Cartabellotta said. "If we don't provide them with adequate protection, it will end up like in a war where soldiers don't die while fighting on the battlefield, but because of lack of equipment. The more medical personnel is infected, the weaker the responsiveness of the healthcare system."

Montreal, Canada - Canada will bar entry to most noncitizens and nonpermanent residents, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, a "significant step" he said aims to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Speaking from self-isolation outside his residence in Ottawa, the capital, Trudeau said his government was acting on the advice of public health officials.
"At every step we've taken the best advice of our public health officials, and now is the time to take this particular step. It is a significant step. It is a step that we take in exceptional circumstances, but it is the right step," Trudeau told reporters. Trudeau began self-isolating after his wife tested positive for the coronavirus.

The travel ban will not apply to United States citizens, however, and this exemption immediately raised some questions and concerns that COVID-19, the disease associated with the virus, could spread between the neighbouring countries.
Canada and the US share an 8,891-km (5,525-mile) land border. More 4,100 people have been infected with the virus in the US, according to John Hopkins University. 
As of Monday morning, Canada had 324 confirmed cases of the coronavirus nationwide and major cities across the country have taken measures to try to stem the spread of the virus.
Trudeau said on Monday that anyone showing symptoms of the coronavirus will also not be allowed to board a plane back to Canada.
Dr Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said that the border measures are "another layer" that the government has put in place "to add to the protection of Canadians".
Three more deaths
The top public health officer in British Columbia (BC), on Canada's west coast, said on Monday that three more people had died due to the virus, raising the death toll in the province to four.
Dr Bonnie Henry, BC's provincial health officer, also said officials were asking people to limit gatherings to a maximum of 50 people. "This is not forever, but it is important for now and for the foreseeable future," she said.
BC's minister of health, Adrian Dix, said that despite the travel ban not applying to US citizens, nonessential visitors should not come to BC.
Experts told Al Jazeera earlier this month that cooperation was key to preventing the spread of the coronavirus amid reports that US President Donald Trump was considering closing the US southern border with Mexico.
Dr Carlos Del Rio, professor of medicine and global health at Emory University, said that border closure would "be of no [public health] benefit to control this epidemic".
Donald Abelson, a political science professor at St Francis Xavier University who specialises in US-Canada relations, said Canada is engaged in a "high-wire act" as it tries to balance its coronavirus response with a need to keep up good relations with its powerful neighbour.
"I think the prime minister is clearly concerned about the political fallout if he banned American citizens from entering Canada. I don't think it really had much to do with health concerns," Abelson told Al Jazeera.
"But having said that, if things get progressively worse he [Trudeau] may have no choice" but to limit entry into Canada for US citizens, he said. "It's not about having American citizenship, it's about how healthy people are [who are] coming across the border, where they have been before, the people with whom they've come into contact."

According to the World Health Organization, one in six COVID-19 patients becomes seriously ill and can develop breathing difficulties.
In the United States, which has more confirmed cases than any other country in the world, the Society of Critical Care Medicine has projected that 960,000 coronavirus patients may need to be put on ventilators at one point or another during the pandemic.

In addition, many ventilators are already in use, supporting other patients with severe, non-coronavirus ailments.
The United Kingdom's National Health System is reported to have just 8,175 ventilators. The government believes up to 30,000 could be needed at the peak of the pandemic.
The situation is especially critical in countries with weak healthcare systems. For example, in the West African country of Mali, home to some 19 million people, there are 56 ventilators.
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, said this week that countries in the continent were looking to engage with wealthier countries to secure key supplies, including ventilators, if the situation deteriorates.

In the most severe cases, the coronavirus damages healthy tissue in the lungs, making it hard for them to deliver oxygen to the blood.
Patients with milder symptoms may be put on non-invasive ventilation, using face masks, nasal masks or mouthpieces which allow pressurised air or mixtures of gases to be pushed into the lungs.

Ventilator makers are under pressure to sharply increase production even as the pandemic has disrupted the transport and supply of crucial parts, such as hoses, valves, motors and electronics - some of which come from China, the original epicentre of the outbreak.
One of the world's largest makers of ventilators, Swiss-based Hamilton Medical AG, aims to raise production numbers to about 21,000 ventilators this year, up from 15,000 last year, by deploying marketing staff on the production line, among other measures.
Meanwhile, a team of doctors in Italy has developed a way to provide oxygen to two people from one ventilator, therefore doubling capacity, according to the Italian region of Emilia Romagna's commissioner for coronavirus.

The findings are an important step in developing a vaccine and treatment, the country's health minister said on Tuesday regarding the virus which has more than 168,000 people worldwide and killed at least 6,610.
While the bulk of those infected experience only mild symptoms, it is severe or critical in 20 percent of patients. The virus mortality rate is about 3.4 percent, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated. 
"People can use our methods to understand the immune responses in larger COVID-19 cohorts, and also understand what's lacking in those who have fatal outcomes," said Katherine Kedzierska, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Melbourne, which took part in the research.
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus.
As researchers monitored the Australian patient's immune response, they were able to accurately predict when she would recover. 
Researchers did not name the patient, but said she was an Australian citizen who was evacuated out of Wuhan the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

At least a dozen drugmakers around the world are working on vaccines or antiviral and other treatments for the fast-spreading contagion. 
But investment costs for vaccines could run as high as $800m in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort.

02:35 GMT - The body fights back: Australian researchers track immune system response
Researchers at Australia's Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity have mapped the immune system response of one of the first people to get COVID-19 in Australia, to find out more about the way in which the body fights the infection.
They took samples from an otherwise healthy woman in her 40s who had been diagnosed with a mild-to-moderate case of the disease, to track her body's response over time.
"Three days after the patient was admitted, we saw large populations of several immune cells ... often a sign of recovery during seasonal influenza infection, so we predicted that the patient would recover in three days, which is what happened," said University of Melbourne Research Fellow Oanh Nguyen.
"We showed that ... in an otherwise healthy person, a robust immune response across different cell types was associated with clinical recovery, similar to what we see in influenza," added Katherine Kedzierska, a professor at the University of Melbourne.
The paper has been published in NatureMedicine, a medical journal.

Italy posts more grim coronavirus records as deaths, cases rise
Rome, Italy - As coronavirus cases jump and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an "enormous" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel.
At least 2,629 health workers have been infected by coronavirus since the onset of the outbreak in February, representing 8.3 percent of total cases, according to a report published on Wednesday by Gruppo Italiano per la Medicina Basata sulle Evidenze or GIMBE - Italy's Group for Evidence-based Medicine.

Coronavirus: Which countries have confirmed cases?
What happens if you catch the new coronavirus?
The data has sent shock waves through the country's already strained healthcare system.
"We extracted this number from data provided by the National Health Institute," GIMBE Director Nino Cartabellotta, a public health expert, told Al Jazeera.
"Figures regarding the contagion among doctors, nurses and general health professionals have started being disclosed only on March 11. Hundreds of new cases have been daily recorded since then. But medical personnel on the front line should be the first to be protected."
Cartabellotta said the actual number was likely to be higher because healthcare workers are not always  tested and protection measures at hospitals were inadequate.
Many who tend to coronavirus patients are still only using surgical face masks with no proper protective filters to shield them from contagion.
The percentage of health workers infected in Italy is almost double the number registered throughout the epidemic in China, during which a total of more than 3,200 people died.
According to figures published in JAMA Network Open, an online medical site from the Journal of the American Medical Association, infected medical staff in China made up 3.8 percent of the total cases, with only five deaths.
Over 60 percent of the medical staff who were infected were registered in the epicentre's outbreak, Wuhan.
On Wednesday, Italy announced that over the preceeding 24 hours, the number of deaths had risen by 475 to 2,978, an increase of 19 percent, as cases jumped to a total 35,713.
There are no official figures on the number of medical personnel who have died of coronavirus in Italy.
According to Italian daily Corriere della Sera, a general practitioner from the province of Lodi died on Wednesday. This raised the death toll of family doctors in the area to four. Other regions have also registered losses among medical staff.
A lack of equipment, resources and personnel has piled pressure on Italy's health system. 
Italy does not produce masks. With the pandemic spreading, some of its closest neighbours have been reluctant to export supplies they may need soon.
"The problem right now is the supply of the protective gear," Cartabellotta said. "The government should have thought of this some time ago. It is logical that following the global explosion of the pandemic, countries producing masks and other protective devices are now keeping them to themselves and stopped their exports.
"We already have a limited number of doctors and nurses. Under extreme circumstances, we could even ask them to keep working even if [they] tested positive for coronavirus. Still, they should be equipped with protective devices to avoid spreading the virus further."
An emergency decree presented by the government on Monday allocated 3.5 billion euros ($3.8bn) towards the ailing health system.
"We are importing medical personnel from abroad and throwing new young healthcare professionals without licenses into the fray," Cartabellotta said. "If we don't provide them with adequate protection, it will end up like in a war where soldiers don't die while fighting on the battlefield, but because of lack of equipment. The more medical personnel is infected, the weaker the responsiveness of the healthcare system."

Outcomes of the Special Cabinet Meeting on the #CoronaVirusSA outbreak #COVID19SA https://t.co/7wNdxac82L
"Suddenly, South Africans jolted into action," said Professor Mosa Moshabela, from the School of Nursing and Public Health of the University of Kwazulu Natal. "And that is good," added Moshabela, who is convinced that the country's fighting chance against the new coronavirus is social distancing and precautious behaviour.
Now declared a pandemic, the outbreak of the new coronavirus that was first detected in China late last year has infected nearly 200,000 people in more than 150 countries.
COVID-19, the highly infectious disease caused by the virus, has so far killed almost 8,000 people, while more than 81,000 others have recovered. Across Africa, the number of registered infections has risen to 418 in 30 countries, while South Africa's government has been one of several in the continent to impose travel restrictions on European countries and the United States.
By Wedneday morning, South Africa had 116 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no deaths.
Despite the relatively low numbers, one of the main worries is what will happen once the virus reaches the crowded inner cities and townships.
"We must alert all South Africans that the internal transmission risk is now settling in," Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize said in a statement on Tuesday. "Once this infection starts spreading in taxis and buses, it will create a new dynamic."
COVID-19 infects people of all ages, but evidence to date suggests that older adults and those with underlying medical conditionsare at higher risk of becoming severely ill.
"We have seven million people that are HIV-positive, and two million are not on treatment," said Professor Susan Goldstein Public, a health specialist and deputy director of the Wits Centre for Health Economics and Decision Science.
Due to the disparate societal and demographic structure of South Africa, there is growing uncertainty about what may happen if the coronavirus is not contained.
"We also don't know how it plays out in very poor areas where there aren't places for quarantine - and bed-sharing is not possible," added Goldstein, who holds some hope that the strong private health sector may open to everyone.
"Then we may have enough beds. That is what the national health insurance is currently trying to achieve."
Dilapidated public health system
More than 25 years after the fall of apartheid, South Africa is still one of the most unequal countries in the world, which translates into the failure of delivering basic services to its people, including healthcare. Eighty-two percent of people living in South Africa have no health insurance and rely on public clinics and hospitals. These facilities are overcrowded and understaffed and often fall short of coping with the high amount of communicable and infectious diseases.
"We cannot contain COVID-19 with our health system alone," Moshabela said. "If we look at how Italy [Europe's coronavirus hotspot] is coping with the virus - we can't do it. We will be similar to that with the difference is that we don't have a big old population but a high number of people who have TB and HIV. Those who are going to be affected the most are going to be between 20 and 60."
Health professionals agree that only a drastic public health response can prevent the virus from spreading at a fast pace, warning that societal factors such as lack of access to information and lack of sense of empowerment - people often do not know where to seek help or what they can do to protect themselves - complicates the fight to contain COVID-19. 
In Bertrams, a low-income neighbourhood just east of Johannesburg's inner city, people started moving into the local supermarkets to equip themselves for what is coming. Shops and other places frequented by the public intensified hygienic controls. Some started wearing face masks.
Having believed a rumour that COVID-19 comes from eating meat, some people think they have to change their diets. On his way out of a local corner shop, a man proudly held up his plastic bag and announced that he is now buying fish. "Nyama [meat] gives you corona," he said.
False information shared in Whatsapp groups and other social media platforms perpetuate the confusion. "A Palestinian scientist has found the vaccine against corona" is one message circulating in the community groups. Another one reads: "Corona can be cured by boiling 8 tablespoons of garlic and 6 cups of water."
Information is an important factor to contain the virus, said Moshabela, whose university will remain shut as of Wednesday. On this last day, he called a meeting in the boardroom to inform the people about the reasons behind the measures that have been taken.

More than 124,000 people in at least 114 countries have been infected with COVID-19, the medical term for the virus, according to WHO. Of those, more than 68,000 have recovered, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the virus.

Coronavirus: Which countries have confirmed cases?
What we know so far about coronavirus
At least 4,600 people have died from the disease, according to the WHO. 
What is a pandemic?
The WHO defines the word pandemic loosely - "the worldwide spread of a new disease".
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a pandemic is a disease that has spread in multiple countries around the world, usually affecting a large number of people.
Why did WHO label coronavirus outbreak a pandemic?
Speaking to media on Wednesday,  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said he was "deeply concerned" by the "alarming levels of inaction" as the outbreak shows no signs of slowing down.
"In the past two weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China has increased 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has tripled," Tedros said.
What will this mean for the outbreak?
Declaration of a pandemic often leads to governments spending more on preventive measures and funding for vaccination programmes.
That was the case the last time WHO declared a pandemic in 2009 during H1N1 "swine flu" outbreak.

Timeline: How the new coronavirus spread
A new coronavirus that emerged in China late last year has spread to more than 170 countries on six continents, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the pathogen a pandemic. 
The death toll from the virus has surged past 30,000 and the number of reported cases is more than 666,000 globally, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Some 141,000 have so far recovered.

As fear has spread, scientists and researchers around the world have ramped up efforts to understand the new virus and how it affects the human body.
Here is what we know about COVID-19 and what happens if you are infected.
The new virus belongs to a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses in humans ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
How dangerous is the new coronavirus?
Thought to have been transmitted to humans from an as-yet-unidentified animal source, the new virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets, such as those generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
On average, it takes about five to six days for someone to show symptoms after becoming infected. However, some people who carry the virus remain asymptomatic, meaning they do not show any symptoms.
The virus multiplies in the respiratory tract and can cause a range of symptoms, according to Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme.
"You have mild cases, which look like the common cold, which have some respiratory symptoms, sore throat, runny nose, fever, all the way through pneumonia. And there can be varying levels of severity of pneumonia all the way through multi-organ failure and death," she told reporters in Geneva on February 7.
However, in most cases, symptoms have remained mild.
A study of 138 patients infected with the new virus in Wuhan, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on February 7, showed the most common symptoms were fever, fatigue and dry cough. A third of the patients also reported muscle pain and difficulty breathing, while about 10 percent had atypical symptoms, including diarrhoea and nausea.
The patients, who ranged in age from 22 to 92, were admitted to the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University between January 1 and 28. "The median age of patients is between 49 and 56 years," JAMA said. "Cases in children have been rare."
Six of the 138 patients died - a figure amounting to a 4.3-percent death rate, which is higher than estimates from other parts of China. Less than 2 percent of the total number of infected people have died from the virus so far but that figure could change.
Meanwhile, a study published on January 24 in The Lancet medical journal found what it called a "cytokine storm" in infected patients who were severely ill. A cytokine storm is a severe immune reaction in which the body produces immune cells and proteins that can destroy other organs.
Some experts say this could explain deaths in younger patients. Statistics from China show some people in their 30s, 40s and 50s, who were not known to have had prior medical issues, have also died from the disease.

A timeline of how the disease progresses
According to JAMA, on average, people became short of breath within five days of the onset of their symptoms. Severe breathing trouble was observed in about eight days.
The study did not give a timeline for when the deaths occurred.
However, an earlier study published in the Journal of Medical Virology on January 29 said that, on average, people who died did so within 14 days of the onset of the disease.
The New England Journal of Medicine, in a study published on January 31, also offered a look at how the coronavirus infection affects the body over time.
The study examined the medical data of a 35-year-old man, the first case of infection in the United States. The first symptom was a dry cough, followed by a fever.
By the twelfth day, his condition had improved and his fever was subsiding. He developed a runny nose, however. On day 14, he was asymptomatic except for a mild cough.
According to local media reports, he sought care on January 19 and was discharged from the hospital in the first week of February.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, told reporters on February 24 that statistics from China suggest recovery time for people with mild disease is about two weeks. People with severe or critical disease may take between three and six weeks to recover.
On February 28, Tedros said nations should prepare themselves for a potential pandemic, as countries aside from China now account for three-quarters of new infections.
On March 4, he warned that a global shortage and price gouging for protective equipment was compromising countries' abilities to respond to the epidemic, and called on companies and governments to increase production by 40 percent.
On March 11, the WHO chief characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic and expressed concern over the "alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction". 
On March 13, Tedros said that Europe had become the epicentre of the pandemic after reporting more cases and deaths than "rest of the world combined, apart from China".

Timeline: How the new coronavirus spread
In medical research labs around the world, scientists are racing to develop a vaccine for a new type of coronavirus that has infected more than 28,000 people and killed over 560 others.
Weeks after the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, at least a dozen biopharmaceutical firms and academic research facilities in China, the United States and others have launched programmes to find an effective vaccine.
One scientist at the Imperial College in London, UK, announced on Wednesday that his team could move towards trials on animals as early as next week and then onto humans within a matter of months. Meanwhile, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership launched in 2017 to fight new infectious diseases, said it had launched three programmes to develop vaccines and hoped to have a potential vaccine for clinal testing within 16 weeks.
Experts say the effort to combat the coronavirus is among one of the quickest responses in recent history. It took researchers more than 20 months to come up with an experimental vaccine for the virus that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a deadly outbreak that also originated in China and infected more than 8,000 people between 2002 and 2003.
The new virus, officially named as 2019-nCov, belongs to the same family as SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has killed more than 850 people since it was first detected in 2012.
The vaccine for MERS is still under development.
The apparent rapid progress in the search for a vaccine to fight the coronavirus, according to analysts, is due to a decision by Chinese authorities to share information about the virus with the public. Advancements in new technology and better collaboration between researchers has also aided the process.

Soon after the 2019-nCov was first detected, scientists in China said they had cracked the virus's genetic sequence and sharing it publicly online on January 10 - a move that allowed virologists and immunologists to begin work on a vaccine almost immediately.
"We downloaded those sequences, immediately ran them through our computer algorithm, which is what we use to design our DNA medicine, and approximately three hours later we had a fully designed DNA vaccine against the novel coronavirus," said Kate Broderick, senior vice president of research and development at the US-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals, one of the companies working with CEPI on an effective treatment.
"We just take a tiny little piece of the genetic sequence of the virus and we specifically use our algorithm to find motifs of the virus that we think would be the best thing to design a vaccine against," she told Al Jazeera.
Inovio was previously working with CEPI to develop a vaccine for MERS and is using the candidate it produced to combat MERS as a starting point.
Unlike traditional methods that involve working with proteins or samples of the virus, new DNA platform technology allow scientists to identify commonalities between two viruses and alter existing vaccines rather than building them from scratch. This greatly speeds up the process, according to Inovio, and makes the resulting drug easier to produce at scale and more durable.
"Because we're so far along in our development for our MERS vaccine ... that means that we're really perfectly positioned to apply what we've learned to this novel coronavirus," Broderick said.

Researchers at the University of Queensland (UQ) in Australia, owners of the "molecular clamp" technology, said they hoped to have a vaccine within six months. In a statement, the university said it has found "promising results" so far from trials targeting viruses that have caused deadly outbreaks in the past, including Ebola, Nipah and MERS.
CEPI has since announced a partnership between British drugmaker GSK and the UQ. The company will provide researches access to its "adjuvant system" - a substance that is added to some vaccines to enhance the immune response and creating a stronger and longer-lasting immunity against infections, according to the company.
The US-based Moderna Therapeutics, another CEPI partner, is working on a vaccine based on ribonucleic acid (RNA), molecules that instruct cells to make proteins to prevent or fight diseases. 
For pharmaceutical companies, the race to create an effective vaccine offers a number of incentives. Winning the race bestows a reputational boost, provides a showcase for the firm's bespoke technology and will bring in revenue from the stockpiling of vaccines by health authorities around the world.
Though the design of new vaccines is taking place at record speed, clinical trials and regulatory hurdles mean it could take months before a drug is proven safe for humans and authorised for widespread use. By that time, the outbreak could be abating.
However, Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, hailed the effort as unprecedented.
"I think it's a very extensive enterprise probably one of the quickest we've seen with any emerging infectious disease outbreak in modern times," he told Al Jazeera.
The growing diversity of vaccine programmes and approaches is a sign that the international response to major outbreaks is becoming more coordinated and efficient, he said.
"There may be room for multiple different vaccines for different purposes and different age groups and different risk groups. The more different approaches and varied approaches we have, and the bigger menu we have of vaccines, the more resilient we'll be against coronavirus outbreaks in the future."

Though vaccines will remain a mid- to long-term solution to addressing global epidemics like the new coronavirus, the new technologies and methods being explored by researchers could eventually pave the way for their usage in the earlier stages of other outbreaks.
"With this really being the first one of the first outbreaks where you're really seeing different approaches being tried all at once in a proactive manner, we may find an approach that can be used in [the future] that will allow vaccines to have a measurable impact in the shorter-term," Adalja said.
In addition to vaccines, researchers are also looking into using antiviral drugs as a treatment. Several clinical trials have already begun on already approved antivirals and steroids to test their effectiveness in treating the new coronavirus.
With an effective treatment months, if not years away, authorities stress that public health approaches must remain a priority in containing the spread of the disease and treating those who have become infected.
These include basic protective measures, such as the frequent washing of hands, avoiding close contact with infected people, and seeking early medical care in the event of a respiratory infection.

N Korea fires more missiles than ever amid coronavirus pandemic
A new coronavirus outbreak, thought to have originated in China's central city of Wuhan, has spread to two dozen countries across the globe, killing more than 350 people and infecting thousands.
All but one of the deaths from the virus have occurred in China and the vast majority of the infections- more than 17,000 cases - have also been reported there. The coronavirus, labelled 2019-nCoV, was first detected in late December.
On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus epidemic in China a public health emergency of international concern. But Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the agency's director-general, said the main reason for the designation was not "because of what is happening in China" but "the potential for this virus to spread to other countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it".
The rapid spread of 2019-nCoV has been accompanied by misinformation and hoaxes online, including false claims about its source, its spread and how to treat it - a dangerous development, according to doctors and health experts. 
Here are four myths the global health agency has busted on the current outbreak.
Myth: Antibiotics are effective in treating the new coronavirus
Administering antibiotics does not help because they only work against bacteria, not viruses.
2019-nCoV is a virus.
Some patients may have antibiotics administered to them in hospital if a bacterial co-infection, which is possible in some cases, occurs.
Myth: Herbal remedies and other drugs can help treat the new virus 
There is no specific medicine recommended to treat the new virus, according to WHO.
"However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care," the agency said.
The agency urged people to follow best practices in hand and respiratory hygiene and handling food in order to reduce exposure to and transmission of the new virus. They include frequently cleaning hands, avoiding close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough, and avoiding the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products. 
Myth: New coronavirus only affects older people
People of all ages can be infected by the virus.
However, the WHO said older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions - such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease - appear to be more vulnerable to falling severely ill with the coronavirus.
Myth: Pets can spread the new coronavirus
There is no evidence at present to suggest that pets such as dogs and cats can be infected with the new virus.

Coronavirus: Which countries have confirmed new cases?
What is a coronavirus?
According to the WHO, coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
These viruses were originally transmitted from animals to people. SARS, for instance, was transmitted from civet cats to humans while MERS moved to humans from a type of camel.
Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.
The name coronavirus comes from the Latin word corona, meaning crown or halo. Under an electron microscope, the looks like it is surrounded by a solar corona.
The novel coronavirus, identified by Chinese authorities on January 7 and since named SARS-CoV-2, is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans. Little is known about it, although human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.
What are the symptoms?
In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and even death.
Current estimates of the incubation period - the time between infection and the onset of symptoms - range from one to 14 days. Most infected people show symptoms within five to six days.
However, infected patients can also be asymptomatic, meaning they do not display any symptoms despite having the virus in their systems.
Read more on what the coronavirus does to your body if you catch it here.
With more than 24,000 recorded deaths, the number of fatalities from the new coronavirus has overwhelmingly surpassed the toll of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, which also originated in China.
SARS killed about 9 percent of those it infected - nearly 800 people worldwide and more than 300 in China alone. MERS, which did not spread as widely, was more deadly, killing one-third of those infected.
While the new coronavirus is more widespread than SARS in terms of case numbers, the mortality rate remains considerably lower at approximately 3.4 percent, according to the WHO.
Since March 16, more cases were registered outside mainland China than inside, marking a new milestone in the spread of the global pandemic. 
The virus has spread from China all around the world, prompting the WHO to label the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.
Read about which countries have confirmed cases here.
Scientists around the globe are racing to develop a vaccine but have warned it is not likely one will be available for mass distribution before 2021.
Meanwhile, a growing number of countries have introduced a series of sweeping measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including nationwide lockdowns, bans on gatherings, closure of schools, restaurants, bars and sports clubs, as well as issuing mandatory work-from-home decrees.  
Where did the virus originate?
Chinese health authorities are still trying to determine the origin of the virus, which they say likely came from a seafood market in Wuhan, China where wildlife was also traded illegally.
On February 7, Chinese researchers said the virus could have spread from an infected animal species to humans through illegally-trafficked pangolins, which are prized in Asia for food and medicine.
Scientists have pointed to either bats or snakes as possible sources of the virus. 
Is this a global emergency?
Yes, this outbreak is a global health emergency, the WHO said on January 30, raising the alarm further on March 11 when it declared the crisis a pandemic.
The international health alert is a call to countries around the world to coordinate their response under the guidance of the WHO.
There have been five global health emergencies since 2005 when the declaration was formalised: swine flu in 2009, polio in 2014, Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and Ebola again in 2019.
Are smokers more likely to be at risk from coronavirus?
Smoking can make people more susceptible to serious complications from a coronavirus infection, the European Union agency for disease control said.
In its updated assessment of the risks caused by the coronavirus, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) included smokers among those potentially most vulnerable to COVID-19.
Smokers have also appeared to be more susceptible to breathing complications caused by the disease, and the ECDC said it was advisable to identify them as a potential vulnerable group, confirming an earlier assessment.
The agency cited a study by Chinese doctors which on a sample of 99 patients affected by the coronavirus found that acute smokers were more at risk of dying than elderly people.
The ECDC report also said smoking was associated with heightened activity in the lungs of an enzyme, ACE2, that could make patients more vulnerable to COVID-19, citing a study conducted by Guoshuai Cai, from the University of South Carolina.

What happens if you catch the new coronavirus?
Human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus strain has been confirmed in China, fueling fears of a major outbreak of the SARS-like virus as millions travel for the Lunar New Year holiday.
Zhong Nanshan, head of the National Health Commission, said on Monday patients may have contracted the new virus without having visited the central city of Wuhan where it was discovered before spreading across China and reaching three other Asian nations.

Zhong said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members who had visited Wuhan.
He added that 14 medical personnel helping with coronavirus patients have also been infected.
Human-to-human transmission could make the virus spread more quickly and widely.
The new coronavirus strain has caused alarm because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.
The total number of people diagnosed with the latest strain of the virus rose to 218, according to CCTV.
Meanwhile, a third person died in Wuhan, according to the local health commission.

Experts believe the epidemic "can still be controlled", the National Health Commission said on Sunday.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the new cases in China were the result of "increased searching and testing for [the virus] among people sick with respiratory illness".

Coronavirus: Which countries have confirmed new cases?
On December 31 last year, China alerted WHO to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, a port city of 11 million people in the central Hubei province. The virus was unknown.
Several of those infected worked at the city's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was shut down on January 1.
As health experts worked to identify the virus amid growing alarm, the number of infections exceeded 40.
On January 5, Chinese officials ruled out the possibility that this was a recurrence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus - an illness that originated in China and killed more than 770 people worldwide in 2002-2003.
On January 7, officials announced they had identified a new virus, according to the WHO. The novel virus was named 2019-nCoV and was identified as belonging to the coronavirus family, which includes SARS and the common cold.
Coronaviruses are common and spread through being in proximity to an infected person and inhaling droplets generated when they cough or sneeze, or touching a surface where these droplets land and then touching one's face or nose.
On January 11, China announced its first death from the virus, a 61-year-old man who had purchased goods from the seafood market. Treatment did not improve his symptoms after he was admitted to hospital and he died of heart failure on the evening of January 9. 
On January 16, Japan's health ministry reported a confirmed case in a man who had also visited Wuhan.

'Utter chaos': China's healthcare weaknesses exposed
Could China's coronavirus outbreak become a global epidemic?
China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December.
Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.
Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and have noted with concern instances in other countries - including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea and Vietnam - where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.
Speaking to reporters in Geneva, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside China.
"Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it."
"This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China," he said. "On the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak."
In response, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman said Beijing has confidence and capability to win the war against the outbreak.
Hua Chunying, the ministry spokeswoman, also said China will continue to work with the WHO and other countries to maintain global and regional public health security.
A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries.
The announcement also imposes more disease-reporting requirements on countries.

He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders.
"During my discussion with the president and other officials, they're willing to support countries with weaker health systems with whatever is possible," Tedros said.
Meanwhile, Russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile (4,180 kilometre) border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak.

Third COVID-19 Death Reported in San Diego
An 87-year-old woman is the latest San Diegan to die from complications from COVID-19, bringing the region’s total to three, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
“The loss of life is always a tragic occurrence,” said Dr. Nick Yphantides, County chief medical officer, adding that the woman had underlying medical conditions. “Our condolences go out the woman’s family and loved ones.”
Earlier today, County health officials continued to urge San Diegans to remain at home to prevent contracting the novel coronavirus and potentially exposing others to COVID-19.
All the guidelines being issued will help prevent many people from getting sick at the same time and “flatten the curve” of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Social distancing has been proven to slow the spread of pandemics so that sick people don’t overwhelm health care systems. Should that occur, there might not be enough hospital beds or mechanical respirators for everyone who needs them.
Get medical attention
County COVID-19 Cases Reach 341
County officials also revealed some new statistics on COVID-19. To date:
More than 543,000 personal protective equipment items have been distributed to the local medical community, including 423,805 N-95 respirators.
More than 2,000 hotel rooms have been secured to isolate people who have potential COVID-19 symptoms and people who are vulnerable and have no place to live.
The County’s COVID-19 webpage now contains a graph showing new positive cases and total cases reported by date. For more information, visit www.coronavirus-sd.com.

3 More COVID-19 Deaths Reported in Region
Three more San Diegans have died from complications of COVID-19, bringing the region’s total to six, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The fourth and fifth deaths were:
A man in his 50s with underlying medical conditions
A man in his 80s with underlying medical conditions
A sixth death, a man in his 20s, will officially be reported tomorrow, but was announced today.
“COVID-19 deaths are very tragic and unfortunate, especially when a person who dies is a young healthy person,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Our sympathies and condolences go out to the families of these individuals.”
The passing of the young man in his 20s, who had no known preexisting health conditions, is evidence that COVID-19 affects all age groups and even the healthy, noted Dr. Wooten.
County health officials are asking the public to remain at home, especially now that community spread is increasing in the region.
Social distancing has been proven to slow the spread of pandemics so that sick people don’t overwhelm the local health care system.
The goal is to flatten the curve of COVID-19 and lessen the number of people who contract the virus and need hospitalization. Doing so will give the local health care system time to increase its capacity to care for more sick people.
San Diego COVID-19 Cases Reach 417
Through March 27, a total of 417 COVID-19 cases have been reported in San Diego County, including 76 cases today.
Of San Diego County’s cases, 249 (60%) were men and 166 (40%) were women. Of the known cases, 85 (20%) have required hospitalization, 38 (9%) had to be placed in intensive care and five (1.2%) have died.

Another San Diego resident, a man in his 80s with underlying medical conditions, has died from complications of COVID-19, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Combined with yesterday’s announcement of a local man in his 20s who died in Riverside County, this brings the total COVID-19 deaths in San Diego County to seven.
“Just these two deaths reflect the sober reality that we are facing, that COVID-19 can affect individuals of all ages,” said Nick Yphantides, County chief medical officer.
County health officials also reported an additional 71 COVID-19 cases in San Diego County, bringing the total to 488.
Of San Diego County’s cases, 280 (57.4%) were men and 206 (42.2%) were women. Of the known cases, 96 (19.7%) have required hospitalization, 42 (8.6%) had to be placed in intensive care and seven (1.4%) have died.
Public Health Order Extended
The County also extended its existing public health order. The order was set to expire on March 31 and has been extended indefinitely. The order mandates the closures of non-essential businesses, including bars, restaurant dining areas, schools, gyms and fitness centers.
Social distancing has been proven to slow the spread of pandemics so that numbers of sick people don’t overwhelm the local health care system and emergency care remains available for non-COVID patients.
The goal is to flatten the curve of COVID-19 and lessen the number of people who contract the virus and need hospitalization. Doing so will give the local health care system time to increase its capacity to care for the expected influx of people who become ill.

Lancaster teen's death no longer counted among Los Angeles County's coronavirus total
A Lancaster teen appears to be the first person under age 18 in the country to die from complications associated with the coronavirus.
LANCASTER, Calif. (KABC) -- A teenager from Lancaster is no longer being included in the tally of coronavirus deaths until a precise cause of death is determined, Los Angeles County health officials announced Wednesday.
The 17-year-old, who was initially believed to be the first person under the age of 18 in the country to die from complications associated with coronavirus, died recently while being treated at Antelope Valley Hospital.
The county's public health director, Barbara Ferrer, said she's asked the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the death of the teen.
While the child did test positive for the coronavirus, there were "extenuating circumstances that pointed to an alternative diagnosis as well," she said.
The death is no longer being counted among LA County's 13 total fatalities from the virus. The county has tallied 799 residents who have tested positive.
Ferrer announced the death of the youth during a briefing Tuesday.
The teen's father was also infected with the coronavirus but had developed less-severe symptoms, according to Lancaster Mayor R. Rex Parris. His father works at a job which involves interaction with the public, Parris noted.
Amid the coronavirus emergency, people are being urged to limit the time they spend in public. But there are essential items that consumers may have to leave their house for.
"From what I've been told his father is an Uber driver," Parris said. "And his father also has the disease. But it's not as bad. Which tells us that these people that we see waiting on us in the checkout line, driving Uber cars, they're risking their lives for us."
WATCH: Is it possible to not show any symptoms even if you have the virus?
"Is it possible to carry the virus and not show any symptoms?" Dr. Lisa Dabby from UCLA Health says yes!
While some indications during the global pandemic have been that people under age 18 have been less severely affected by the virus, Los Angeles County public health director Dr. Barbara Ferrer noted the death shows nobody is truly immune.
"COVID-19 does not discriminate by age, race or income level," Ferrer said.

Maladie à coronavirus (COVID-19) : Mise à jour sur l’éclosion
Surveillance de la COVID-19 par le Canada
Carte - Distribution des cas confirmés et probables de COVID-19 par province ou territoire au Canada - Description textuel
Le 11 mars 2020, l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) a qualifié la COVID-19 de pandémie.
Cette évaluation par l'OMS n'est pas inattendue. Qualifier la situation de pandémie ne modifie en rien l'évaluation par l'OMS de la menace que représente la COVID-19 ni ce que l'OMS fait. Cela ne modifie pas non plus ce que les pays du monde entier devraient faire compte tenu de la situation. Pour cette raison, la situation ne change pas l'approche que nous adoptons au Canada.
La COVID-19 représente une menace grave pour la santé, et la situation évolue quotidiennement. Le risque variera à l'intérieur d'une même communauté et d'une communauté à l'autre, mais étant donné le nombre grandissant de cas au Canada, le risque que courent les Canadiens est considéré comme élevé.
Cela ne signifie pas que l'ensemble des Canadiens contracteront la maladie. Cela signifie qu'il y a déjà un impact significatif sur notre système de soins de santé. Si nous n'aplatissons pas la courbe épidémique dès maintenant, l'augmentation des cas de COVID-19 pourrait avoir un impact sur les ressources de soins de santé disponibles pour les Canadiens.
Pensez-vous avoir la COVID-19 ?
Surveillance de la COVID-19 par le Canada
L'administratrice en chef de la santé publique maintient des contacts étroits avec les médecins hygiénistes en chef des provinces et des territoires pour s'assurer que tous les cas de COVID-19 recensés au Canada continuent d'être rapidement détectés et gérés, afin d'ultimement protéger la santé des Canadiens.
Le Laboratoire national de microbiologie du Canada procède à des tests diagnostiques pour détecter le virus qui cause la COVID-19. Le Laboratoire collabore étroitement avec les laboratoires de santé publique des provinces et des territoires, qui sont maintenant en mesure d'effectuer les tests relatifs à la COVID-19. Un résumé des personnes testées au Canada est disponible et est actualisé chaque jour de la semaine.
Le présent résumé des tests représente les renseignements recueillis par le Laboratoire et non le nombre total de cas signalés au Canada. Le reste des tests qui ne sont pas signalés dans la présente ne sont toujours pas terminés.
En cas de différence entre le nombre national de cas et les nombres de tests signalés par les responsables provinciaux et territoriaux de la santé publique, les données provinciales doivent être considérées comme étant les plus à jour.
Le 18 mars 2020, le Canada annonce une aide financière, par l'entremise du Plan d'intervention économique pour répondre à la COVID-19, pour les Canadiens et les entreprises aux prises avec des difficultés découlant de l'éclosion de la COVID-19.
Le 11 mars 2020, l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé déclare que l'éclosion de COVID-19 est devenue une pandémie.
Le 9 mars 2020, le Canada confirme son premier décès lié à la COVID-19.

Au sujet des coronavirus
Symptômes de la COVID-19
Les personnes infectées par la COVID-19 peuvent n'avoir que peu ou pas de symptômes. Vous ne savez peut-être pas que vous avez des symptômes de la COVID-19 car ils peuvent s’apparenter à ceux d’un rhume ou d’une grippe.
Les symptômes peuvent prendre jusqu'à 14 jours pour apparaître après l'exposition à la COVID-19. Il s'agit de la plus longue période d'incubation connue pour cette maladie. Nous étudions actuellement si le virus peut être transmis à d'autres personnes si une personne ne présente pas de symptômes. Bien que les experts estiment que c'est possible, on considère que c'est moins commun.
Pensez-vous avoir la COVID-19 ?
Si vous avez des symptômes de la COVID-19 :
veuillez signaler à un agent des services frontaliers du Canada à votre arrivée au Canada si vous pensez avoir été exposé à une source de COVID-19, même si vous ne présentez pas de symptômes
Avez-vous pris un vol ou une croisière, ou participé à un rassemblement public? Vérifiez ces lieux d'exposition pour voir si vous avez pu être exposé à la COVID-19.
Diagnostic du coronavirus
Les infections à coronavirus sont diagnostiquées par les fournisseurs de soins de santé en fonction des symptômes présentés et sont confirmées au moyen d’analyses en laboratoire.
Traitement du coronavirus
Pour le moment, il n'existe aucun vaccin pour COVID-19 ni aucun produit de santé naturel autorisé pour traiter ou protéger contre la COVID-19. Si vous avez reçu un vaccin antigrippal, il ne vous protégera pas contre les coronavirus.
Au sujet des coronavirus
Les coronavirus constituent une grande famille de virus. Certains provoquent des maladies chez les humains et d’autres chez les animaux. Les coronavirus humains sont courants et se traduisent généralement par de légers malaises, semblables à ceux du rhume.
La COVID-19 est une nouvelle maladie qui n’a pas encore été identifiée chez l’homme. Dans de rares cas, les coronavirus infectant les animaux peuvent infecter des personnes; plus rarement encore, ils peuvent se transmettre par contact étroit de personne à personne.
Il y a eu 2 autres coronavirus qui se sont transmis des animaux aux humains, et ont causé des maladies graves chez l’humain :
le coronavirus du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SRAS-CoV)
le coronavirus du syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient (CoV-SRMO)

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): How to isolate at home when you have COVID-19
Organization: Public Health Agency of Canada
Isolation means staying at home when you have symptoms of with COVID-19 and avoiding contact with other people to help prevent the spread of disease to others in your home and your community.
If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, or are waiting to hear the results of a lab test for COVID-19, it is expected that you take the following measures.
Do not leave home unless absolutely necessary, such as to seek medical care.
If you have to be in contact with others, keep at least 2 metres between yourself and the other person. Keep interactions brief and wear a face mask.
Avoid contact with individuals with chronic conditions, compromised immune systems and older adults.  
You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch often, like toilets, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.
Use a store bought disinfectant to disinfect.
Put the lid of the toilet down before flushing.
Monitor your symptoms as directed by your health care provider or public health authority.
If your symptoms get worse, immediately contact your health care provider or public health authority and follow their instructions.
Face masks (do not re-use)
Alcohol-based sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol
Store bought disinfectant
Alcohol prep wipes
We can all do our part in preventing the spread of COVID-19. For more information, visit Canada.ca/coronavirus or contact 1-833-784-4397.

About coronaviruses
Symptoms of COVID-19
Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu.
Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease. We are currently investigating if the virus can be transmitted to others if someone is not showing symptoms. While experts believe that it is possible, it is considered less common.
Symptoms have included:
In severe cases, infection can lead to death.
Think you might have COVID-19?
If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:
visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority
call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions
advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms
this is required under the Quarantine Act
Have you been on a flight or cruise, or at a public gathering? Check these exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.
Diagnosing coronavirus
Coronavirus infections are diagnosed by a health care provider based on symptoms and are confirmed through laboratory tests.
Treating coronavirus
Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.
If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.
Vaccine
At this time, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 or any natural health products that are authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19.
If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses.
About coronaviruses
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.
COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.
There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV)
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV)

How Canada is monitoring COVID-19
Map - Total Number of COVID-19 Cases in Canada - Text Description
Global
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) assessed COVID-19 as a pandemic.
This assessment by the WHO is not unexpected. Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change the WHO's assessment of the threat posed by COVID-19 and it does not change what the WHO is doing. It also does not change what countries around the world should do. For that reason, it does not change the approach we are taking in Canada.
Canada's public health system is prepared. Since the outset, the Public Health Agency of Canada - along with public health authorities at all levels of government across the country - have been working together to ensure that our preparedness and response measures are appropriate and adaptable, based on the latest science and the evolving situation.
Aside from Canada, other countries and regions are reporting cases. Check the latest travel health notices before travelling.
COVID-19 is a serious health threat, and the situation is evolving daily. The risk will vary between and within communities, but given the increasing number of cases in Canada, the risk to Canadians is considered high.
This does not mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It means that there is already a significant impact on our health care system. If we do not flatten the epidemic curve now, the increase of COVID-19 cases could impact health care resources available to Canadians.
with compromised immune systems
with underlying medical conditions
There are also increased health risks for Canadian travellers abroad. Because of these risks, the Government of Canada advises you to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice. This includes cruise ships.
some provinces and territories may have specific recommendations for certain groups such as health care workers
monitor your health for symptoms such as for cough, fever or difficulty breathing
We continue to reassess the public health risk, based on the best available evidence as the situation evolves.
Think you might have COVID-19?
How Canada is monitoring COVID-19
The health and safety of all Canadians is our top priority.
The Public Health Agency of Canada is working with provinces, territories and international partners, including the World Health Organization, to actively monitor the situation. Global efforts are focused on containment of the outbreak and the prevention of further spread.
Canada's Chief Public Health Officer of Canada is in close contact with provincial and territorial Chief Medical Officers of Health to ensure that any cases of COVID-19 occurring in Canada continue to be rapidly identified and managed in order to protect the health of Canadians.
Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory is performing diagnostic testing for the virus that causes COVID-19. The laboratory is working in close collaboration with provincial and territorial public health laboratories, which are now able to test for COVID-19. A summary of people tested in Canada is available and updated each week day.
This testing summary represents information collected by the laboratory and not the total reported cases in Canada. The remainder of tests not reported here are still being resolved.
Should there be any differences with the national case count compared with testing numbers reported by provincial and territorial public health officials, provincial data should be considered the most up-to-date.
On March 18, 2020, Canada announces financial help, through the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, for Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declares the global outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic.
On March 9, 2020, Canada confirms its first death related to COVID-19.

Map - Total Number of COVID-19 Cases in Canada - Text Description
Global
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) assessed COVID-19 as a pandemic.
This assessment by the WHO is not unexpected. Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change the WHO's assessment of the threat posed by COVID-19 and it does not change what the WHO is doing. It also does not change what countries around the world should do. For that reason, it does not change the approach we are taking in Canada.
Canada's public health system is prepared. Since the outset, the Public Health Agency of Canada - along with public health authorities at all levels of government across the country - have been working together to ensure that our preparedness and response measures are appropriate and adaptable, based on the latest science and the evolving situation.
Aside from Canada, other countries and regions are reporting cases. Check the latest travel health notices before travelling.
COVID-19 is a serious health threat, and the situation is evolving daily. The risk will vary between and within communities, but given the increasing number of cases in Canada, the risk to Canadians is considered high.
This does not mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It means that there is already a significant impact on our health care system. If we do not flatten the epidemic curve now, the increase of COVID-19 cases could impact health care resources available to Canadians.
with compromised immune systems
with underlying medical conditions
There are also increased health risks for Canadian travellers abroad. Because of these risks, the Government of Canada advises you to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice. This includes cruise ships.
some provinces and territories may have specific recommendations for certain groups such as health care workers
monitor your health for symptoms such as for cough, fever or difficulty breathing
We continue to reassess the public health risk, based on the best available evidence as the situation evolves.
Think you might have COVID-19?
How Canada is monitoring COVID-19
The health and safety of all Canadians is our top priority.
The Public Health Agency of Canada is working with provinces, territories and international partners, including the World Health Organization, to actively monitor the situation. Global efforts are focused on containment of the outbreak and the prevention of further spread.
Canada's Chief Public Health Officer of Canada is in close contact with provincial and territorial Chief Medical Officers of Health to ensure that any cases of COVID-19 occurring in Canada continue to be rapidly identified and managed in order to protect the health of Canadians.
Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory is performing diagnostic testing for the virus that causes COVID-19. The laboratory is working in close collaboration with provincial and territorial public health laboratories, which are now able to test for COVID-19. A summary of people tested in Canada is available and updated each week day.
This testing summary represents information collected by the laboratory and not the total reported cases in Canada. The remainder of tests not reported here are still being resolved.
Should there be any differences with the national case count compared with testing numbers reported by provincial and territorial public health officials, provincial data should be considered the most up-to-date.
On March 18, 2020, Canada announces financial help, through the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, for Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declares the global outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic.
On March 9, 2020, Canada confirms its first death related to COVID-19.
On February 9, 2020, Canada expands COVID-19 screening requirements for travellers returning from affected areas to 10 airports across 6 provinces.
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declares the outbreak of COVID-19 a public health event of international concern.
On January 25, 2020, Canada confirms its first case of COVID-19 related to travel in Wuhan, China.
On January 22, 2020, Canada implements screening requirements related to COVID-19 for travellers returning from China to major airports in Montréal, Toronto and Vancouver.
On January 15, 2020, the Public Health Agency of Canada activates the Emergency Operation Centre to support Canada's response to COVID-19.
On January 7, 2020, China confirmed COVID-19.
On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The virus did not match any other known virus.

For health professionals
The World Health Organization (WHO) has assessed COVID-19 as a pandemic. The assessment by the WHO is not unexpected.
In Canada, our health system is prepared for this situation. Since the outset, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), along with public health authorities at all levels of government across the country, have been working together to ensure that our preparedness and response measures are appropriate and adaptable, based on the latest science.
COVID-19 is a serious health threat, and the situation is evolving daily. The risk will vary between and within communities, but given the increasing number of cases in Canada, the risk to Canadians is considered high.
This does not mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It means that there is already a significant impact on our health care system. If we do not flatten the epidemic curve now, the increase of COVID-19 cases could impact health care resources available to Canadians.
with compromised immune systems
with underlying medical conditions
Our public health efforts will continue to focus on containment to delay the onset of community spread by rapidly identifying cases, meticulously finding close contacts and using tried and true public health measures such as isolation and social distancing.
In the event of community transmission, these actions will continue as long as feasible to interrupt chains of transmission in the community and to delay and reduce an outbreak where possible.
In order to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, everyone has a role to play. It takes more than governments and action from the health sector to protect the health and safety of Canadians. Each of us can help our country be prepared in the event of an emergency by understanding how coronavirus spreads and how to prevent illness.
Canadians should continue to think ahead about the actions that they can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread of any illness, especially respiratory infections.
Now and always during cold and flu season, stay home if you are sick. Encourage those you know are sick to stay home until they no longer have symptoms.
Since respiratory viruses, such as the one that causes COVID-19, are spread through contact, change how you greet one another. Instead of a handshake, a kiss or a hug, a friendly wave or elbow bump is less likely to expose you to respiratory viruses.
Practise frequent hygiene, which includes proper hand washing and coughing and sneezing etiquette. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, such as toys and door handles.
These are the most important ways that you can protect yourself and your family from respiratory illness, including COVID-19.
Stock up on essentials but avoid panic buying
Physical distancing measures are a way to reduce COVID-19 transmission in the community by minimizing close contact with others, especially people who are at high risk for severe illness during the peak of the outbreak.
Public health measures for schools and daycare are intended to provide a safer school environment by encouraging:
regularly cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces and objects like door handles, toilets and toys
Students and staff who show symptoms of COVID-19 should stay at home.
Across Canada, we are changing the way we work to prevent the spread of COVID-19. For some workplaces, this may mean changing hours of operation, closing for a period of time or working from home. Others continue to go to work because their jobs are essential to keeping Canada functioning during this outbreak.
Essential workers are considered critical to preserving life, health and basic societal functioning. This includes, but is not limited to:
health care workers
All employees should understand and comply with the infection prevention policies and practices in place in their workplaces. Employers should use the risk-informed decision-making guidelines for workplaces and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Employers and employees will need to work together to protect their own health and their clients’ health, as well as deliver essential services.

How coronavirus spreads
Preventing coronavirus
Risks of getting coronavirus
How coronavirus spreads
Human coronaviruses cause infections of the nose, throat and lungs. They are most commonly spread from an infected person through:
respiratory droplets generated when you cough or sneeze
touching something with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands
There is a difference between advice to self-monitor, advice to self-isolate and advice to isolate. It is important to note these measures are in place to protect the health and safety of Canadians.
Preventing coronavirus
Canadians should continue to think ahead about the actions that they can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Canada, including:
following the latest travel advice from federal and provincial public health leaders:
self-isolating, and monitoring for symptoms (cough, fever or difficulty breathing) for 14 days if you have travelled outside of Canada
practicing social distancing and proper hygiene 
Think you might have COVID-19?
Social distancing
Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Social distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak.
limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health
use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available
Health Canada has published a list of hard surface disinfectants that are likely to be effective for use against coronavirus (COVID-19).
Although they do not claim to kill viruses such as COVID-19, cleaners can play a role in helping limit the transfer of microorganisms. Health Canada recommends cleaning often, using either regular household cleaners or diluted bleach (1 part bleach to 9 parts water) the following high-touch surfaces:
If you are a healthy individual, the use of a mask is not recommended for preventing the spread of COVID-19.
However, your health care provider may recommend you wear a mask if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 while you are seeking or waiting for care. In this instance, masks are an appropriate part of infection prevention and control measures. The mask acts as a barrier and helps stop the tiny droplets from spreading you when you cough or sneeze.
Risks of getting coronavirus
COVID-19 is a serious health threat, and the situation is evolving daily. The risk will vary between and within communities, but given the increasing number of cases in Canada, the risk to Canadians is considered high.
This does not mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It means that there is already a significant impact on our health care system. If we do not flatten the epidemic curve now, the increase of COVID-19 cases could impact health care resources available to Canadians.
Have you been on a flight or cruise, or at a public gathering? Check these exposure locations  to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.
The risk for COVID-19 may be increased for certain settings such as:
with compromised immune systems
with underlying medical conditions
If you have symptoms (cough, fever or difficulty breathing), do not attend a mass gathering, event or places where people gather. You could put someone whose health is vulnerable at risk.
The risk for getting COVID-19 may be increased for travellers. Canadians are advised to avoid all non-essential travel. If you must travel, check the latest travel advice before you leave.
Throughout pregnancy, women experience changes in their bodies that may increase the risk of some illnesses, including viral respiratory infections, such as the flu. At this time, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19.
If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.
Survival of coronaviruses on surfaces
It is not certain how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Preliminary information on COVID-19 suggests that the virus may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days depending on different conditions, such as:
Products shipped within or from outside of Canada could also be contaminated. However, because parcels generally take days or weeks to be delivered, and are shipped at room temperature, the risk of spread is low. There is no known risk of coronaviruses entering Canada on parcels or packages.
To protect yourself from COVID-19, make sure to do the following when handling products shipped within or outside of Canada:
regularly clean and disinfect surfaces
There is currently no evidence to suggest that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus and there are currently no reported cases of COVID 19 transmission through food. People are unlikely to be infected with the virus through food.  
Scientists and food safety authorities across the world are closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19.
Coronaviruses are killed by common cleaning and disinfection methods and by cooking food to safe internal temperatures.
The current spread of COVID-19 is a result of human-to-human transmission. There is no evidence to suggest that pets or other animals play a role in transmitting the disease to humans. Scientists are still trying to understand if and how it affects animals. 
Pets can contribute to our overall happiness and well-being, especially in times of stress. If you are feeling well (no symptoms of COVID-19) and are not self-isolating because of COVID-19 illness, you can continue to take walks with your dog or spend time with your pet. This can contribute to keeping both you and your pet healthy.
As a precautionary measure, if you have COVID-19 symptoms or are self-isolating due to contact with a COVID-19 case, you should follow similar recommendations around animals, as you would around people in these circumstances:
These measures are recommended as a precaution, and are basic practices to prevent transmission of diseases between humans and animals. If you have concerns, seek professional advice from your veterinarian or a public health professional who can help to answer your questions.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency website has more information about animals and COVID-19.
We have not approved any product to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. Selling unauthorized health products or making false or misleading claims to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19 is illegal in Canada. We take this matter very seriously and we are taking action to stop this activity.
We have also not approved any disinfectant products with claims specific to COVID-19. However, authorized disinfectant products can make a claim of broad spectrum of activity against viruses if they meet specific evidence standards. We are working with companies and we will publish a list of disinfectant products that can make this claim to help Canadians make effective choices.
We encourages anyone who has information regarding potential non-compliant sale or advertising of any health product claiming to treat, prevent or cure COVID-19, to report it using our online complaint form.

What health professionals need to know
What health professionals need to know
Health professionals in Canada have a critical role to play in identifying, reporting and managing potential cases of COVID-19.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which infect only animals, and others that can infect humans. Seven strains of coronavirus are now known to cause illness in humans.
The strain of coronavirus found in Wuhan is the most recent of 7 known strains. Of the 6 others, 4 cause only minor respiratory symptoms similar to those of a cold, and 2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS CoV), have been associated with more serious and life-threatening diseases.
Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. Symptoms, similar to a cold or flu, may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. Current studies are investigating if the virus can be transmitted to others if someone is not showing symptoms. Symptoms include:
In severe cases, infection can lead to death.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is actively monitoring the situation and has issued updated information on the outbreak, including a risk assessment, advice on public health measures and infection prevention and control, and enhanced surveillance.
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is also monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely and providing updates as new information becomes available.
Current epidemiologic information suggests that human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 can occur when an individual is in close contact with a symptomatic case. Human coronaviruses are most commonly spread from an infected person through: respiratory droplets; close, prolonged personal contact; and touching an infected area, then touching mouth, nose or eyes before washing hands.
PHAC is collaborating with provincial and territorial public health partners to collect information on COVID-19 cases in Canada. A detailed epidemiologic summary is available.
PHAC’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) has capacity to identify COVID-19, and is developing and implementing new diagnostic tests, based on the genetic sequence of COVID-19 made available by China on January 10, 2020. Laboratory testing should be initiated in consultation with the respective provincial Public Health Laboratory (PHL). The PHL will then coordinate the submission of specimens to the National Microbiology Laboratory for further testing, as necessary. Refer to Protocol for Microbiological Investigations of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections for details on specimen collection and handling, and regarding consultation with the PHL microbiologist on-call. Refer also to additional laboratory guidance provided by PHLs.
Health care professionals can refer to the Interim National Surveillance Guidelines for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), and the Interim National COVID-19 Case Report Form, to aid with the detection and reporting of COVID-19 in Canada.
Note that reporting for COVID-19 cases to the Public Health Agency of Canada is completed by provincial or territorial health authorities. The Public Health Agency of Canada does not accept reports from the public or individual health care providers.
Recommendations to public health care professionals
Familiarize yourself with the interim national case definition for COVID-19 to consider the possibility of COVID-19 in persons with relevant clinical and exposure history.
Familiarize yourself with the Interim National COVID-19 Case Report Form, to facilitate case reporting of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases.
Provincial/territorial public health authorities should report confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases to PHAC within 24 hours of their own notification.
PHAC must report events that meet the requirements for International Health Regulations Articles 6 and 7 to the WHO within 24 hours of assessment of public health information.
The Protocol for Microbiological Investigations of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) will help to facilitate the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections due to both unknown and known respiratory pathogens that have the potential for large-scale epidemics.
Familiarize yourself with the guidance on the public health management of cases and contacts associated with COVID-19.
In the absence of effective drugs or vaccines, infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies to prevent or limit transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities include:
management and placement of probable and confirmed cases
masks, tissues and alcohol-based hand rubs (AHBR) should be available at entrances
signage should be posted to instruct symptomatic patients to alert healthcare workers, thus prompting completion of a patient screening questionnaire
If a person presents with symptoms of influenza-like illness and within 14 days before the onset of illness, has travelled outside of Canada, and/or been in close contact with a probable or confirmed case of COVID-19 or someone who has travelled outside of Canada:
encourage the patient with signs and symptoms of an acute respiratory infection to perform respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, and provide tissues, AHBR and a waste receptacle
do not cohort with other patients (unless necessary, in which case cohort only with patients confirmed to have COVID-19)
The application of routine practices and additional precautions (RPAP) is based on a point-of-care risk assessment (PCRA). Health care workers (HCWs) should use a risk assessment approach before and during each patient interaction to evaluate the likelihood of exposure.
an N95 respirator (plus eye protection) should be used when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) on a person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19
There is currently no vaccine against or specific treatment for COVID-19. Treatment is supportive and should be tailored to the patient's condition.
The WHO has published guidance on the clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus infection is suspected.
Drugs and Vaccines
When a vaccine or drug is developed to prevent or treat COVID-19, we will take appropriate action to ensure availability.
scientific review of new drugs or vaccines through a priority review or a notice of compliance with conditions
use of the Extraordinary Use New Drugs pathway for making a promising new drug or vaccine available in order to secure the health of Canadians during an emergency
Canadian clinical trials for new vaccines, new or repurposed antivirals, or supportive therapies
the importation of a new drug authorized for sale in the U.S., Switzerland or European Union through the list of drugs for an urgent public health need
Special Access to Remdesivir for COVID-19 in Canada
Gilead is transitioning the provision of emergency access to remdesivir from individual compassionate use via Health Canada’s Special Access Program requests to access through clinical trials. This approach will both accelerate access to remdesivir for severely ill patients and enable the collection of data from all participating patients. These programs are currently under rapid development in conjunction with national regulatory authorities worldwide including Health Canada. More details on how to participate in clinical trials will be forthcoming.
During this transition period, Gilead is unable to accept new individual Canadian compassionate requests via Health Canada’s Special Access Program due to an overwhelming demand.
Exceptions will be made only for pregnant women or children less than 18 years of age with confirmed COVID-19 and severe manifestations of disease.
Diagnostic testing and medical devices
Tests developed by laboratories for their own use don't require regulatory approval. Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory has implemented testing to diagnose COVID-19 from clinical specimens. The laboratory is working in close collaboration with provincial and territorial public health laboratories, which are now able to test for COVID-19. Laboratory testing should be initiated in consultation with the respective Provincial Health Laboratory.
An Interim Order has been signed to help ensure quicker and more flexible approval of the importation and sale of medical devices that are necessary for Canada's response to COVID-19, including test kits. We have published a list of commercial diagnostic tests authorized for sale in Canada.
An interim order is one of the fastest mechanisms available to the Government of Canada to help make health products available to address larger scale public health emergencies.
If you wish to submit an application for authorization under the Interim Order please contact the Medical Devices Directorate via email hc.devicelicensing-homologationinstruments.sc@canada.ca or call 613-324-7842. Health care professionals can obtain COVID-19 diagnostic test kits or supportive devices not yet approved for sale through the Medical Devices Special Access Program.
For general inquiries about the licensing or authorization of medical devices in Canada; you can contact the Medical Devices Directorate at 613-957-7285 or hc.meddevices-instrumentsmed.sc@canada.ca.

To learn more about Canada’s actions to help Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, refer to Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.
The Government of Canada is continually assessing travel risks for Canadians. An official global travel advisory is in effect: Avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice. In addition, a pandemic COVID-19 travel health notice with travel health advice for Canadians has also been issued.
foreign nationals invited by the Canadian government to assist in the COVID-19 response

Canada and the U.S. recognize how closely our economies are integrated. It is essential that trade continue during this pandemic. Economic supply chains remain open and we will work to ensure that access to goods and services is not interrupted.
Entry screening is an important public health tool. Canada Border Services Agency officers are trained to perform entry screening.
Self-isolation for returning travellers
All travellers who are permitted to enter or return to Canada must self-isolate for 14 days upon entry. There are exceptions for workers who are essential to the movement of goods and people. Individuals should avoid contact with other people for 14 days, while monitoring themselves closely for symptoms.
When showing signs and symptoms of infection
If you are Canadian or a permanent resident, and you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you may still enter Canada by land, rail or marine. You may not enter Canada by air, to protect the health of all travellers.
If you are not Canadian or a permanent resident, and you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you will not be permitted to enter Canada. 
If you show signs of an infectious disease, officials will contact a quarantine officer.
The quarantine officer will perform a more detailed assessment. If necessary, the quarantine officer may:
order you to be transported to hospital to undergo a medical examination
inform the local public health authority
To help Canadians return home or cope with challenges they are facing while travelling, the Government of Canada has created the COVID-19 Emergency Loan Program for Canadians Abroad.
The Program will provide the option of an emergency loan to Canadians in need of immediate financial assistance to return home or to temporarily cover their life-sustaining needs while they work toward their return.
Global Affairs Canada is providing 24/7 consular support to Canadians abroad affected by COVID-19 through the Emergency Watch and Response Centre and through consular staff at its network of missions.
The Federal/Provincial/Territorial Public Health Response Plan for Biological Events has been activated to ensure a coordinated response across Canada.
A special advisory committee has been established to advise the Deputy Ministers of Health on the coordination, public health policy and technical content related to this outbreak. This committee consists of the members of the Pan-Canadian Public Health Network Council and the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health.
The Public Health Agency of Canada is working closely with partners domestically and around the world, including the World Health Organization (WHO), to respond to this outbreak.
Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) has developed a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test that can diagnose COVID-19 from clinical specimens. The NML is working collaboratively with Canadian provincial public health laboratories to ensure there is additional testing capacity in multiple jurisdictions.
Further collaborative scientific studies to investigate the virus are underway.
The Government of Canada is working with international regulators to help fast-track clinical trials and applications for vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests. The International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities held a global medicines regulators web meeting on March 18, 2020. Discussions included regulatory considerations for anticipated COVID-19 vaccine candidates to advance regulatory convergence. A key objective of the meeting was to discuss and agree on an approach to the requirements to support first-in-human clinical trials. The press release and meeting report are available for access. Health Canada has also engaged with international regulatory partners under the Australia-Canada-Singapore-Switzerland Consortium to explore potential collaboration on regulatory issues related to COVID-19.
We are also working closely with international regulatory partners, including the European Medicines Agency, the United States Food and Drug Administration, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration, to share information on any signals of global supply disruptions.
Companies and researchers with drugs, medical devices, or natural health products that may be effective in treating or diagnosing COVID-19 are encouraged to contact us to facilitate clinical trials.

Drug and medical device supply monitoring
The Government of Canada is actively monitoring the novel COVID-19 and its impact on the supply of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, natural health products and medical devices in Canada. We do this through regular contact with:
drug, medical device and natural health products manufacturers and importers
We are aware that there may be supply disruptions related to COVID-19 and are monitoring the situation closely.
Companies that market prescription drugs for human use in Canada must report anticipated or actual drug shortages on Drug Shortages Canada. We have contacted companies to remind them of this requirement. Industry stakeholder associations have also been asked to notify us of any early signals of shortages related to COVID-19. Drug and medical device shortage signals can also be reported by the provinces and territories, healthcare professionals or the public.

Symptoms of COVID-19
Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu.
Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease. We are currently investigating if the virus can be transmitted to others if someone is not showing symptoms. While experts believe that it is possible, it is considered less common.
Symptoms have included:
In severe cases, infection can lead to death.
Think you might have COVID-19?
If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:
visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority
call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions
advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms
this is required under the Quarantine Act
Have you been on a flight or cruise, or at a public gathering? Check these exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.
Diagnosing coronavirus
Coronavirus infections are diagnosed by a health care provider based on symptoms and are confirmed through laboratory tests.
Treating coronavirus
Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.
If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.
Vaccine
At this time, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 or any natural health products that are authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19.
If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses.
About coronaviruses
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.
COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.
There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV)
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV)

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Travel advice
Outbreak update
Symptoms and treatment
For health professionals
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
An official global travel advisory is in effect: Avoid non-essential travel outside Canada until further notice.
Check out the Pandemic COVID-19 travel health notice.
If you need financial help to return to Canada, check COVID-19: Financial help for Canadians outside Canada.
Avoid all cruise ship travel due to COVID-19.
The Government of Canada has put in place an Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act that applies to all travelers arriving in Canada in order to slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Canada.
Travellers with symptoms: mandatory isolation
If you have recently returned to Canada and you have symptoms, you must ISOLATE. This is mandatory. If required, immediate medical attention will be provided upon arrival in Canada.
Mandatory isolation means you MUST:
go to your place of isolation using private transportation only, such as your personal vehicle
do not leave your place of isolation unless it's to seek medical attention
do not have visitors and limit contact with others in the place of isolation, including children
do not isolate in a place where you will have contact with vulnerable people such as older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions
if your symptoms get worse, immediately contact your health care provider or public health authority and follow their instructions
If you have symptoms but do not have a place to isolate, you will be required to isolate for 14 days in a facility designated by the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada.
Travellers without symptoms: mandatory quarantine
If you have recently returned to Canada and you have no symptoms, you must QUARANTINE (self-isolate) yourself. This is mandatory. You are at risk of developing symptoms and infecting others.
monitor your health for symptoms of COVID-19
You can take public transportation to get to your place of self-isolation after you arrive in Canada, but you must not stop on the way home and practice physical (social) distancing at all times.
If you develop symptoms within 14 days:
immediately call a health care professional or public health authority and:
describe your symptoms and travel history
Stay at home as much as possible. All Canadians should be practicing physical (social) distancing. Even if you don't have symptoms of COVID-19, you could become infected by others.
limit contact with people at higher risk (e.g. older adults and those in poor health)
have not been diagnosed with COVID-19;
do not have symptoms of COVID-19;
The continued global movement of goods and people and the ongoing delivery of essential services will be important for Canada's response to COVID-19.
Consequently, several categories of people are exempted from this order because they provide critical services, if they have no symptoms. These include people who:
are making necessary medical deliveries of cells, blood and blood products, tissues, organs, or other similar lifesaving human body parts, as required for patient care
cross the border regularly to go to work, including in the healthcare sector or critical infrastructure workers for the purpose of performing their duties
have to cross the border to provide or receive essential services, including emergency responders and personnel providing essential services to Canadians related to the COVID-19 outbreak
practise social distancing (maintain a distance of 2 metres from others)
Should they exhibit any symptoms, they MUST isolate and contact their local public health authority.
conduct active daily monitoring of their staff for COVID-19 symptoms (checking for cough, fever or shortness of breath)
use the risk-informed decision-making guidelines for workplaces/businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic
To limit the spread of COVID-19, the Government of Canada advises that you avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.
Making the choice to stay at home and to not travel outside of Canada is the best way to protect yourself, your family and the most vulnerable groups in our communities from the spread of COVID-19.
check the Pandemic COVID-19 travel health notice before travelling
know the health risks for your destination
It is important to remember that if you travel abroad, you could be subject to the measures of other countries. Your one-week trip may become much longer. You may also have reduced access to quality health care.
If you must travel, take precautions against respiratory illnesses, and seek medical attention if you become sick.
Be aware of the local situation and follow local public health advice.
All travellers are reminded to follow these health precautions:
Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel.
Monitor your health:
If you become sick when you are travelling, avoid contact with others except to see a health care professional.
If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, report this information to a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada. This is required under the Quarantine Act. The Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow.
We have put messaging on arrivals screens at international airports that will help guide travellers to inform a border services officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms.
In addition, information on what symptoms to identify and how to contact local health authorities will be provided to arriving travellers.
The Government of Canada is advising that you avoid all travel on cruise ships due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, until further notice.
Cruise passengers include travellers from around the world who may be arriving from areas with known or unknown spread of COVID-19. The virus can spread quickly on board cruises due to the close contact between passengers. Older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing severe disease.
Recent cruise ship outbreaks of COVID-19 indicate that a large number of individuals onboard can become infected. While the majority of affected passengers may experience mild symptoms, there have been a significant number of cases requiring hospitalization and critical care, and some deaths have been reported.
As the COVID-19 situation evolves, many countries outside of Canada are implementing policies and restrictions in order to contain the global outbreak. These restrictions may impact a cruise traveller's:
access to health care
While abroad, if an outbreak of COVID-19 occurs on your cruise ship:
you could be subject to quarantine procedures, on-board ship or in a foreign country
upon return to Canada, you will be required to remain in mandatory isolation for 14 days at a location determined by the Chief Public Health Officer as per the terms of any applicable emergency orders
However, essential travel may need to occur and travellers should expect increased health screening measures at points of entry for international destinations, including airports and land borders. Local authorities may impose control measures suddenly, including movement restrictions such as quarantines.
Sign up with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service to stay connected with the Government of Canada in case of an emergency abroad or an emergency at home.

Considerations in the use of homemade masks to protect against COVID-19
Notice to General Public and Healthcare Professionals
Health Canada is advising the public, as well as healthcare professionals (HCPs) to use caution when considering the use of homemade masks to protect against the transmission of COVID-19.
Homemade masks are not medical devices and consequently are not regulated, like medical masks and respirators. Their use poses a number of limitations:
they may not provide complete protection against virus-sized particles
These types of masks may not be effective in blocking virus particles that may be transmitted by coughing, sneezing or certain medical procedures. They do not provide complete protection from the coronavirus because of a potential loose fit and the materials used.
* or equivalent approved N95 surgical respirators are designed to reduce the risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles and aerosols. These respirators are medical devices authorized by Health Canada. An N95 respirator is a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles. The 'N95' designation means that when subjected to careful testing the respirator blocks at least 95% of very small test particles.
Medical masks are also medical devices that use materials that block at least 95% of very small test particles, however, they do not fit tightly to the face, so are not designed to provide complete protection for the wearer. Both respirators and masks need to be used in combination with appropriate eye protection (e.g., face shield, goggles) to achieve full protection of the eyes, nose and mouth.
Health Canada has provided important information on optimizing the use of masks and respirators during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The Public Health Agency of Canada guidance on preventing coronavirus includes guidance on wearing masks, if necessary, and includes the following:
If you are a healthy individual, the use of a mask is not recommended for preventing the spread of COVID-19
However, your health care provider may recommend you wear a mask if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 while you are seeking or waiting for care. In this instance, masks are an appropriate part of infection prevention and control measures. The mask acts as a barrier and helps stop the tiny droplets from spreading you when you cough or sneeze.

Here’s some key information about COVID-19:
The betacoronavirus that causes COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2 (formerly 2019-nCoV).
Person-to-person and community spread has been reported in numerous countries, including the United States.
Transmission primarily occurs when there is contact with an infected person's bodily secretions, such as saliva or mucus droplets in a cough or sneeze. Transmission via touching a contaminated surface or object (i.e., a fomite) and then touching the mouth, nose, or possibly eyes is also possible, but appears to be a secondary route. Smooth (non-porous) surfaces (e.g., countertops, door knobs) transmit viruses better than porous materials (e.g., paper money, pet fur) because porous, especially fibrous, materials absorb and trap the pathogen (virus), making it harder to contract through simple touch.
There are currently no antiviral drugs recommended or licensed by FDA to treat COVID-19, and there is no immunization available.
 Cases of COVID-19 and community spread are being reported in most states.
The best way to avoid becoming ill is to avoid exposure to the virus. Taking typical preventive actions is key.
While 2 dogs (Hong Kong) and 1 cat (Belgium) have been reported to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets spread COVID-19 to other animals, including people.
If you are not ill with COVID-19, you can interact with your pet as you normally would, including walking, feeding, and playing. You should continue to practice good hygiene during those interactions (e.g., wash hands before and after interacting with your pet; ensure your pet is kept well-groomed; regularly clean your pet’s food and water bowls, bedding material, and toys).
Out of an abundance of caution, it is recommended that those ill with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. Have another member of your household take care of walking, feeding, and playing with your pet. If you have a service animal or you must care for your pet, then wear a facemask; don’t share food, kiss, or hug them; and wash your hands before and after any contact with them.
As always, careful handwashing and other infection control practices can greatly reduce the chance of spreading any disease. The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians’ (NASPHV) compendium of standard precautions is a good reference for appropriate infection control in veterinary practices.

Apple’s COVID-19 response
The global spread of COVID-19 is affecting every one of us. At Apple, we are people first, and we do what we do with the belief that technology can change lives and the hope that it can be a valuable tool in a moment like this. Teachers are innovating to make remote lessons come alive. Companies are experimenting with new ways to stay productive. And medical experts can diagnose illnesses and reach millions with critical updates in the blink of an eye. We are all adapting and responding in our own way, and Apple wants to continue to play a role in helping individuals and communities emerge stronger.
But this global effort — to protect the most vulnerable, to study this virus, and to care for the sick — requires all of our care, and all of our participation. And I want to update you about the ways in which we are doing our part.
Apple’s committed donations to the global COVID-19 response — both to help treat those who are sick and to help lessen the economic and community impacts of the pandemic — today reached $15 million worldwide.
We’re also announcing that we are matching our employee donations two-to-one to support COVID-19 response efforts locally, nationally and internationally.
First, I want to recognize Apple’s family in Greater China. Though the rate of infections has dramatically declined, we know COVID-19’s effects are still being strongly felt. I want to express my deep gratitude to our team in China for their determination and spirit. As of today, all of our stores in Greater China have reopened. I also want to thank our operations team and partners for their remarkable efforts to restore our supply chain. What we’ve learned together has helped us all develop the best practices that are assisting enormously in our global response.
One of those lessons is that the most effective way to minimize risk of the virus’s transmission is to reduce density and maximize social distance. As rates of new infections continue to grow in other places, we’re taking additional steps to protect our team members and customers.
In all of our offices, we are moving to flexible work arrangements worldwide outside of Greater China. That means team members should work remotely if their job allows, and those whose work requires them to be on site should follow guidance to maximize interpersonal space. Extensive, deep cleaning will continue at all sites. In all our offices, we are rolling out new health screenings and temperature checks.
All of our hourly workers will continue to receive pay in alignment with business as usual operations. We have expanded our leave policies to accommodate personal or family health circumstances created by COVID-19 — including recovering from an illness, caring for a sick loved one, mandatory quarantining, or childcare challenges due to school closures.
Apple News has launched a new COVID-19 section, where users can be sure that they can find the latest verified reporting from trusted news outlets.
There is no mistaking the challenge of this moment. The entire Apple family is indebted to the heroic first responders, doctors, nurses, researchers, public health experts and public servants globally who have given every ounce of their spirit to help the world meet this moment. We do not yet know with certainty when the greatest risk will be behind us.
And yet I have been inspired by the humanity and determination I have seen from all corners of our global community. As President Lincoln said in a time of great adversity: “The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.”

Oh God, There’s Pandemic Merch Now
It’s safe to say that there are a lot of things people need right now more than merch. And yet, in this cursed month of March in these doomed United States, here it is — pandemic-inspired merch.
It was bound to happen. Merch has always served as reflection of the times — a memento of a certain moment or, now, a micromoment. It allows us to repackage big ideas in ways that are eye-catching and easily digestible and fast. For a while, we were making merch out of our own headlines. Now, everything has been merchified, including the name of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and our country’s current face of reason.
On Friday, it was brought to our attention that baseball caps with “Faucci” written in the Gucci logo font are now being sold for $32 online by a brand called Social Distancing Caps with the description: “Fauci, but make it fashion.” The good news is that all profits will be donated to Meals on Wheels, a program that delivers meals to individuals at home who are unable to purchase or prepare their own. The creator of the hats, who prefers to remain nameless, says he’s raised $6,000 in a week. That said, you can also just donate to Meals on Wheels directly and spare the manufacturing and shipping involved with buying and selling merch.
“I’m a guy quarantined at my girlfriend’s house who wanted to raise money for a good cause,” the creator told the Cut. “I’m proud that our hats are doing something to help.” It was an idea he had at his kitchen table one night, along with hats that say “Social Distancing.” He thought these would be something people could send to their parents and grandparents, “who needed to remind the folks around them to keep safely away.”

Please note the story you’re reading was published more than a day ago. COVID-19 news and recommendations change fast: Read the latest here to stay up-to-date. We’ve lifted our paywall on all essential news and updates about the coronavirus.
As the number of coronavirus cases in the United States continues to rise sharply, one family has been particularly devastated by the virus. Four members of a family in Freehold, New Jersey, have died of complications from COVID-19. According to the New York Times, three other members of the family have been hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19; they are reportedly in critical condition.
Roseann Paradiso Fodera, a relative and the family’s lawyer, told the Times that the family’s matriarch, Grace Fusco, died on Wednesday at the age of 73. She was the mother of 11 and grandmother of 27. Fusco’s son Carmine died a few hours earlier, and her 55-year-old daughter Rita Fusco-Jackson died on Friday. Her family didn’t learn that Fusco-Jackson had contracted the virus until after her death. Paradiso Fodera told the Times that Fusco passed away after she fell “gravely ill” and was put on a ventilator, and that she died without knowing of her two children’s deaths. Another of her sons — Vincent Fusco — died on Thursday.
Rita was reportedly the second person in New Jersey confirmed to have died from the virus. The first was a man who had contact with a guest of a recent Fusco family party, according to state health commissioner Judith Persichilli. As of Thursday, there were 427 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New Jersey, and at least five patients with the virus have died.
Officials are still looking for clues in the family’s medical history that would explain why the virus progressed so quickly and severely in these cases. Paradiso Fodera said that 20 other relatives are quarantined at their homes. “It’s so pitiful,” she said. “They can’t even mourn the way you would.”

Everything to Know About the Coronavirus in the United States

In February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that the United States should brace for a domestic coronavirus outbreak. Throughout the month of March, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. has risen dramatically: As of Friday morning, the United States officially has the highest confirmed case count in the world, with at least 85,381 people across every state who have tested positive for the disease.
Globally, more than 536,100 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 171 countries, with at least 24,460 deaths so far. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and President Trump declared a national state of emergency. As of Friday morning, at least 1,271 American patients with the virus have died.
Here’s everything we know about the spread of the virus in the U.S. so far.
How many new coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the U.S.?
As of March 27, there were at least 85,381 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S., and at least 1,271 patients with the virus had died. However, officials have warned that due to delays in testing in many areas, the total number of infected individuals is likely much higher. Over the last week, the rate of diagnosis has accelerated dramatically as a number of states have expanded their testing capacity; New York State, which has been testing aggressively, has been announcing thousands of new cases every day. Yet the New York Times reports that there’s still huge variation in the rates of testing among states.
As of Friday morning, New York had by far the largest outbreak in the country, with at least 38,987 confirmed cases and 432 deaths. Other states that have been hardest hit by the virus include New Jersey, California, and Washington State. So far, at least 151 patients with the virus have died in Washington State, and 35 of those deaths have been linked to an outbreak of COVID-19 at a long-term care facility, the Life Care Center, in Kirkland, Washington.
The New York Times reports that Louisiana may now be experiencing the fastest growth of new COVID-19 cases in the world. As of Friday morning, the state had at least 2,305 confirmed cases and 83 deaths. Medical experts suspect the sudden spike could be linked to Mardi Gras celebrations, which concluded on February 25.
What measures are being taken to limit the spread of coronavirus?
As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has continued to rise, a growing number of states have announced drastic measures to slow the spread of the virus. As of Friday morning, officials in 21 states have ordered residents to stay at home, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. These “stay-at-home” orders require residents to stay indoors except for essential activities, which include buying food, seeking medical treatment, and exercising outdoors, provided they stay six feet away from anyone not part of their household. Medical professionals, caregivers, public-safety officials, sanitation workers, and other essential workers, such as those who work in grocery stores and pharmacies, are exempt.
A number of cities have also announced stay-at-home orders, and Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Nevada have ordered all nonessential businesses in their states to close. The Times reports that more than half of all Americans will soon be under orders to stay at home, and the widespread lockdowns have had serious economic consequences: Last week, more than 3.2 million Americans filed unemployment claims, a record number. President Trump has questioned whether the economic toll of stay-at-home orders is worth it, and has said he hopes to see the U.S. economy reopened by Easter. However, public-health officials have warned that loosening restrictions could lead to many more deaths.
As of Saturday, schools in 45 states were closed entirely. In New York City, the largest school district in the country, public schools will remain closed until at least April 20, though Mayor Bill de Blasio said there was a strong chance they would not reopen before the end of the school year. The mayor said that some schools will reopen as “enrichment centers” to provide services to vulnerable children, including homeless students and those with special needs, and that the city would open centers to provide child care for the children of health-care and emergency workers.
Governor Andrew Cuomo has warned that the New York hospital system may soon be overwhelmed by the number of coronavirus cases, and has criticized the federal government for not taking sufficient action to provide needed medical equipment and supplies. The Times reports that, as of Thursday morning, nearly 1,300 COVID-19 patients in New York were in intensive care units, most of them on ventilators. De Blasio has said that New York City will need 15,000 ventilators to fight the crisis. The federal government has not yet reached a deal with manufacturers to ramp up production, and President Trump said on Thursday that he thought the need for ventilators may have been exaggerated.
What is the federal government doing to fight coronavirus?
In February, President Donald Trump put Vice-President Mike Pence — a man with a frankly dismal track record in public health — in charge of the coronavirus response, assuring the public that the White House is “very, very ready for this.”
Earlier this month, President Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic, effectively freeing up to $50 billion in federal funds to help states and territories fight the spread of the virus, which he said would include expanding access to testing.
Still, there have been many issues with the availability of the coronavirus test. Some people say they’ve been denied tests, and even though Pence announced on March 3 that anyone in the country can be tested for coronavirus, subject to doctor’s orders, the rate of testing still varies widely from state to state. The Times reports that the U.S. is currently performing 65,000 tests a day — a huge rise from even a week ago. However, public-health experts say about 150,000 tests a day are needed to identify infected patients and slow the spread of the virus.
The State Department has also issued a Level 4 “do not travel” advisory, the most serious advisory at its disposal, asking United States citizens to avoid any global travel. It has also advised Americans, especially those who are older or have existing medical conditions, to avoid cruises at this time.
Last week, President Trump signed a relief package to establish paid emergency leave for some American workers, expand food assistance, medical aid, and unemployment benefits, and offer free coronavirus testing. The U.S. House and Senate recently reached a deal to provide $8.3 billion in emergency funding to stop the spread of the coronavirus. According to the Washington Post, the money will go toward the development of a vaccine, public-health funding, medical supplies, and research of coronavirus in other countries. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has said it will take around 18 months to develop a vaccine for COVID-19.
What should I do to minimize my coronavirus risk?
In most cases, COVID-19 is not fatal, but it appears to pose the greatest risk to elderly people and those with preexisting conditions that compromise their immune systems. The New York Times reports that among those who have died in the U.S., almost all have been in their 70s, 80s, and 90s. However, a new report by the CDC found that American adults of all ages have been seriously sickened by the virus, noting that 38 percent of American patients who have been hospitalized with the virus were between the ages of 20 and 54. (Doctors and medical workers may also be at greater risk, due to their higher-than-average odds of exposure.) Because the CDC anticipates a sharp uptick in domestic transmission, it is urging people to prepare for the worst: Stock up on supplies — medicine, non-perishable foods, toilet paper, etc. — and fastidiously wash your hands. (Here’s our guide to protecting yourself.)
If you have symptoms associated with coronavirus — coughing, fever, respiratory issues — call your doctor before showing up at their office: The virus is highly contagious and you want to limit the possibility of spreading it. If you are sick, the CDC recommends that you stay home and self-isolate, confining yourself to one room as much as possible and wearing a face mask when you have to interact with others. Wash your hands frequently — soap and water and at least 20 seconds of scrubbing — and avoid touching shared household items, cleaning “high-touch” surfaces (like your phone) regularly. Your health-care provider and even local health department will help you determine how long it’s appropriate for you to keep up these precautions.
Regardless of whether or not you have symptoms, though, keep your hands clean, and seriously, stop touching your face and just stay home.

President Trump and Coronavirus Task Force Brief Reporters
President Trump, Vice President Pence, and members of the Coronavirus Task Force briefed reporters at the White House on the latest developments… read more
Thank you very much. I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus.
Last week, I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, which, as you know, we invoked previously and which activated FEMA's National Response Coordination Center. FEMA now is fully engaged at the highest levels.
We're sending, upon request, the two hospital ships; they're being prepared right now. They're massive ships. They're the big white ships with the red cross on the sides. One is called the Mercy and the other is called the Comfort. And they are in tip-top shape. They soon will be. They're getting ready to come up to New York. I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it. He's excited about it.
Earlier this week, the first clinical trial of the vaccine candidate for the virus began in Washington State, as you probably know. The genetic sequence of the virus was first published in January. But thanks to the unprecedented partnership between the FDA, NIH, and the private sector, we've reached human trials for the vaccine just eight weeks later. That's a record by many, many months. It used to take years to do this, and now we did it just in a very short while.
That's the fastest development in history of what we're doing with regard to the vaccine. We're making very, very big progress.
If you haven't done - the groups are working on determining if a self-swab by an individual is as effective as the other. The other is very effective, very accurate. But we're going to see if we can do a self-swab, which is - would be a lot more popular, I can tell you that. So - and that would be administered also by a health official, but it would be a lot easier to do.
The - the fact is that the health professionals would - it would free - it would free up a lot. Let me just say, the self-swab is what it is: It's a self-swab; you do it yourself. The other has to be issued by a health professional, and it's something that is quite difficult. And we think it's working out for the self-swab. And if it would test positive, the people would go and they would do what they have to do. But we think that's probably working out.
And this afternoon, I'll be meeting with nurses on the frontlines of the battle against the virus. They are truly American heroes. They want to get it done. They're incredible people. So we're going to be meeting with nurses, and I actually look forward to that. They're very brave. They're taking a lot of risk. And they - they have done an incredible job and they never complain.
Thank you, Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force met this morning, and now that we have cases in all 50 states, we're continuing to move out on the President's call to bring the full resources of the federal government, the full partnership with every state and territory, the full power of the American economy, to support businesses and families.
Yesterday, the President met with the tourism industry executives and also had an engaging discussion with all the top companies in our industrial and medical supply chain.
The President spoke with some of the nation's top business leaders today, again, to speak about the supply chain in the country. And, for our part, we're going to be conducting a conference call later today with state and local health officials to renew our ongoing commitment of cooperation and collaboration.
With regard to testing, I'm pleased to report that we're increasing the number of tests being performed by the thousands, every day, thanks to the public-private partnership that President Trump forged with commercial laboratories around the country.
Our health experts tell us to remind every American: It's important to remember people without symptoms should not get tested. We want to make sure that the supply of testing is there for those that need it most or are symptomatic or in the vulnerable population.
On the subject of supplies, the President has our task force extremely focused. As the President mentioned yester- - mentioned that he's invoking the Defense Production Act today. Secretary Esper, in a few moments, will describe the ongoing efforts that the Department of Defense is taking to make medical resources available. Secretary Robert Wilkie will announce decisions the VA has made to expand hospital capacity within their system.
Also, with regard to medical personnel, at the President's direction, HHS is issuing a regulation today that will allow all doctors and medical professionals to practice across state lines to meet the needs of hospitals that may arise in adjoining areas.
In addition to that, we are again today asking every American and our medical community leaders and hospitals to partner with us in delaying elective procedures across the country in our healthcare system to ensure that medical supplies and medical capacity go where they're needed most. Seema Verma will describe guidance that CMS will be issuing on that front.
And finally, just, I want to remind every American of the President's 15-day guidance to slow the spread. We're grateful for members of the media and the general public that are adhering to these, sharing them with neighbors and friends. All of our experts continue to believe that if every American will do their part, and embrace and put into practice these principles, that we can significantly limit the reach of the coronavirus in the weeks and months ahead.
We think part of this may be that people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea that the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were at particular risk. It may have been that the millennial generation, our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades, there may be a disproportional number of infections among that group. And so even if it's a rare occurrence, it may be seen more frequently in that group and be evident now.
So, again, I'm going to call on that generation that's part of that group that brought us innovation, particularly throughout all of their ability to look around corners and skip through games. I'm - I always went level by level; I didn't realize that you could go from level three to level seven. That's what they've taught us. They look for things that we don't see. We need them to be healthy.
So, again, not only calling on you to heed what's in the guidance, but to really ensure that each and every one of you are protecting each other. And so we cannot have these large gatherings that continue to occur throughout the country for people who are off work, to then be socializing in large groups and spreading the virus. You have the potential then to spread it to someone who does have a condition that none of us knew about and cause them to have a disastrous outcome.
Finally, on the testing piece and what we're learning: I know you know, last week, in bringing the private sector - I think what has been exciting to me over the last two and a half weeks is to see this administration harness the full capacity of the private sector, understanding that a lot of our solutions that we need to confront this virus, a lot rely on the private sector. Bringing the private-sector commercial labs was critical in - to this process. We are now beginning to see that they have spread out in a prioritized way, because we asked them to prioritize the regions that were mostly affected.
And so you still may have difficulty getting tests in areas that do not have significant cases. We've had them prioritize the regions where we need diagnosis and their diagnostic percent. Remember, I told you South Korea was under 4 percent, so 96 percent of people were negative. The last report we've seen from the laboratories have about a 7-plus percent positivity rate. Still, 93-plus percent or 92 percent are negative. But I think that's encouraging to me, personally, that we're prioritizing appropriately to those areas that have the greatest need
Today and yesterday, Thermo Fisher pushed out most of their laboratory testing capacity, and that will dramatically increase that platform and the ability to run additional tests, in addition to Roche.
So I appreciate everybody's attention to these numbers. I'm excited that we've prioritized where the need was the greatest. But again, please follow the guidance and please make sure in every report that you're putting out that you're talking about the presidential guidance to actually stop the spread of this virus.
Thank you, Mr. President. So, good afternoon, everyone. And I want to provide an update on DOD's coronavirus efforts as we continue to focus on our three priorities. That's, first of all, protecting our personnel and their families. Second, safeguarding our national security mission capabilities. And third, of course, supporting the administration's whole-of-government approach.
First of all, though, I do want to assure the American people that the United States military remains ready and capable of defending the country and our interests abroad. Now, with that, the department is leaning forward in our response to COVID-19. We have issued international and domestic travel restrictions to all DOD personnel and families that should dramatically reduce potential exposure to the virus. Those have been in place for some time now.
As I announced yesterday, the Department of Defense will make available up to 5 million N95 respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from our own strategic reserves to the Department of Health and Human Services for distribution. The first 1 million masks will be available immediately. We are also prepared to distribute to HHS up to 2,000 operational deployable ventilators for use as needed.
Yesterday, I was at Fort Detrick, Maryland, which is probably the military's premier research institute, where I got updated on the incredible work our people are doing as part of the interagency team to work on vaccines and therapeutics. They're making great progress there.
We also have announced that we've certified our 16th lab - or we'll soon certify our 16th lab to help with processing tests from across the country.
Additionally, I have directed, as the President mentioned, that the hospital ships, Mercy and Comfort, be prepared to deploy to increase the nation's medical capacity. And we have also alerted a variety of field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as well as needed based on direction from the Commander-in-Chief.
I want to conclude by thanking again all of our service members and their families who have been affected by this outbreak. They're all great heroes. We are continuing to support them throughout this. We are all in this together.
Thank you. So, yesterday, the President made a very important announcement about telehealth, and this is allowing our 62 million seniors to be able to get some medical services from the safety of their home, reducing their risk and without any co-pays.
But we're also making sure that the healthcare system is prepared and that those on the frontlines have the support that they need. The reality is the stakes are high and we need to preserve personal protective equipment for those that are on the frontlines of this fight.
Conserving personal protective equipment is also essential to combat the virus. So today, CMS will announce detailed recommendations to further promote this needed conservation, specifically by limiting non-essential elective medical and surgical procedures, including dental procedures.
We believe that these recommendations will help surgeons, patients, and hospitals prioritize what is essential while leaving the ultimate decision in the hands of state and local health officials and those clinicians who have direct responsibility to their patients.
And we urge providers and clinicians and patients to seriously consider these recommendations. They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the frontlines, and it will protect patients from unnecessary exposure to the virus.
We fully appreciate that this is going to have a major impact on the healthcare system, but the shared sacrifice is essential to help those that are on the frontlines.
And I want to thank the medical societies, such as the American College of Surgeons and the American Dental Association, that took a proactive approach and already posted these recommendations. And we've also talked to the American Medical Association, and they have fully indicated their support for this recommendation. We now invite the entire healthcare community to join us in this effort.
Last month, we established 19 emergency operations centers across the country. We began to limit the number of visitors who entered our facilities. We began, I think, the first - we were the first system to begin triaging, across the country in our 170 hospitals, the entrance of anyone into our facility without being questioned or tested.
These were all part of the President's directive to be as aggressive in a public health sense as we could be. I think we have set the pace for the entire country.
The last thing I will say is that you've heard a lot about the fourth mission that VA has. Our first three missions are healthcare, benefits, and memorial affairs. Our fourth mission is to support the federal government in times of natural disasters and pandemics.
We are the buttress force in case that FEMA or HHS calls upon us to deploy medical professionals across the country to meet crises. We plan for that every day. We are gaming out emergency preparedness scenarios. And we stand ready, when the President needs us, to expand our mission.
Okay. Why do you keep calling this the "Chinese virus"? There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in this country. Your own aide, Secretary Azar, says he does not use this term. He says, "Ethnicity does not cause the virus." Why do you keep using this? A lot of -
Senator Schumer said on the floor, a short time ago, that it urgently needs to be put into action to produce medical supplies, particularly ventilators.
Well, we're going to see. I don't want to get into that right now, John. We are looking at different numbers. We're looking at timing that would be different - splitting the times, splitting the payments. We're looking at a lot of different things. It hasn't been determined yet, but it will shortly be determined. And people want to go big, as opposed - everybody seems to want to go big. And they want to get to the recovery.The big day is - the big thing we can do is get rid of this horrible - I call it the "unseen" - the unseen enemy. You call it - there's a thousand different terms for it, but whatever - it snuck up on us. And it's - it did 128 countries, I think. It's in something like that - very close to that. Think of that. So it spreads violently. It's a very contagious - very, very contagious virus.
Do you consider America to be on a wartime footing, in terms of fighting this virus?
I do. I actually do. I'm looking at it that way because, you know, if - if it got out of control - the big thing we did was a very early stoppage of people coming in who could be very, very heavily infected. And that was a -that was a very good move.And it was very early - very, very early - when most people, including a lot of professionals, they didn't want us to do it. That really saved a lot of lives.And, yeah, I look at it - I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. I mean, that's what we're fighting. I mean, it's - it's a very tough situation. You're - you have to do things. You have to - you have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they've ever been. We had the best economy we've ever had. And then, one day, you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy. And - but we're doing it, and we're doing it well.And I'll tell you, the American people have been incredible. For the most part, they've been really incredible.Yeah, please, Kaitlan.
I have a question for you and then I have one for Secretary Wilkie, as well. But I'll start with you. You just said there are a tremendous number of ventilators that we have, but, for weeks, hospitals have been worrying about a critical shortage that they say we are not prepared for. So why did it take so long to invoke the Defense Production Act?
Well, you know, hospitals are supposed to have ventilators, too. And when we have thousands of ventilators - it sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing. Normally, we wouldn't be doing testing. And they decided to do it. Very, very hard to ramp up. Now we're getting highly sophisticated tests, and it's going very well. But nobody has ever heard of testing in the kind of quantities that you're talking about.
We have a specific number of ventilators in the stockpile. It is in excess of 10,000. And you just heard the announcement from the Department of Defense; they'll be adding several more thousand to that.But the President, even this morning and yesterday afternoon, speaking with the largest companies in the supply chain in this country, we're hearing a tremendous spirit among industry leaders who are ready to step in and add to that volume.Now, the stockpiles don't count all of the ventilators that exist today in the marketplace and in healthcare facilities around the country. But the President has given us a directive to make sure that our stockpile but, just as importantly, working with industry leaders, that we're securing the increase in ventilators, the increase in masks, gloves, eye protective care, garments that are all necessary to lean forward.And we're confident we'll be able to accomplish that with the incredible cooperation of the supply chain that exists in America today.
- is not going to be a vector of the virus? How can you be sure that trade and everything that's being shipped from one side to the other is not -
Well, I think we're doing a really good job. We started off with a termination of the border - the people coming in from China, where this all started. That meant I took it very seriously. And when I use the word "calm" - "calm" doesn't mean that I'm not taking it seriously. "Calm" means - and we should be calm. We should be extremely calm.But, yeah, 95 percent within the Republican Party, and over 50 percent. And I also have - we have very great approval numbers. I mean, people like the job that we're doing. And when you compare this to other epidemics, or if you want to use a different term, you can, but within this country - and you look at what's happened over the years, this is being handled very, very professionally. We have the greatest professionals in the world. We're doing a good job. Nobody has ever been swamped like this in - nothing has been so contagious - the level of contagion has been incredible, actually. Nobody has seen anything quite like this.Yeah. Peter, go ahead.
Can I ask about the test, sir, for a second? If federal officials have shipped millions of tests, as you and your colleagues have said, why, as the federal government says, have only 59,000 tests been processed to this point? We just heard from the Atlanta Public Health director saying that they have fewer than 50 test kits for more than 900,000 citizens. Where are the tests?
So that's a very critical question. And thank you for asking it. So the test kits that we put out last week through the approval - the rapid movement of that meeting that President Trump called less than two weeks ago - that has resulted in bringing our private sector to the table. Because the tests and the platform that was out there could only run between 4 and 12 tests per platform, per day. We've now moved into platforms that can run, basically, tens of thousands of tests per day.So the reason I'm grateful for your question - because it allows me to point out that, of course, then there was backlog. There were individuals who had been tested who hadn't had their specimen run because of the slow throughput. It's now in a high-speed platform.So we will see the number of people diagnosed dramatically increase over the next four to five days. I know some of you will use that to raise an alarm that we are worse than Italy because of our slope of our curve.To every American out there, it will be five to six days' worth of tests being run in 24 to 48 hours. So our curves will not be stable until sometime next week. The reason I talked about Thermo Fisher yesterday, is because their platform is in 2,000 laboratories. They're the ones that are putting out the million tests this week that will solve the issue that Atlanta and others have brought up.
Mr. President, perhaps I could second follow up. How are non-symptomatic professional athletes getting tests while others are waiting in line and can't get them? Do the well-connected go to the front of the line?
Excuse me. Excuse me. We inherited a very obsolete system. This was a system that was out of date, obsolete, or it was a system that was never meant to take care of the kind of quantity, the number of people that we're talking about - millions and millions of people.If you go back in years past, like even recently with the flu, nobody had tests before. They didn't test the entire nation to see whether or not they had flu. They got the flu, they got better - hopefully, they got better - and that was it. Now, all of a sudden, they do this very complex testing.What we've done is we've broken it down, we've broken up the system, but it was obsolete and/or you could say it was also a system that just wasn't meant to handle the kind of volume that you're talking about. We've rebuilt it into a system that, for the future, will be a very good system if you want to go this route.But this was never done before. And I would imagine it will be done in the future, but we've built it into a very good system by using private companies - the great private companies. And I have to say Roche has been doing a very good job. They're doing a lot of work, a very good job.But this was an obsolete system. This was not a system that was meant to do anything like this or even near this.John?
Mr. President, a couple of things. A major trade coalition is calling on you to suspend tariffs with other countries as part of the response to the coronavirus.
No, I know. I'm sure free trade.Look, China is paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there's no reason to do that. They haven't even spoken to me about that. China hasn't asked me to do that, but we're getting billions of dollars a year from tariffs from China. And I can't imagine Americans asking for that, but it could be that China will ask for a suspension or something. We'll see what happens.China is having a very rough time. They have their worst year in 76 years, as I understand it. They're having a very, very tough time. And then, on top of it, this happened with the virus.But, no, we're taking in billions of dollars a year in tariffs. And this was caused by something totally unrelated to tariffs.
Well, I think "essential" is medical. We have military working together; we have industry working together. And, again, it's not affecting trade. So things like that.But just leisurely, "Let's go to a restaurant and have dinner" - which a lot of people do. They come both ways; they go in both directions. That kind of thing, we have ended on a temporary basis.Yeah, please go ahead.
I just wanted to clarify something, because just a week ago, you all were standing here telling us that unless you had sustained contact with somebody who was symptomatic for COVID-19, you really didn't need to worry. You told the President, the Vice President that if they shook hands with somebody who had this, if they took a photograph with somebody who had this, they didn't really need to worry. And yet, several days later, we're in a situation where people are being told, "Don't leave your houses." There are curfews saying you cannot walk alone at night after a certain time.Can you walk us through what seems like a very dramatic swing, a very dramatic disconnect from what we were hearing before to what we're hearing now?
So, two things. We look at data all the time. And I know you're looking at the China and South Korea data. And when you look at China and South Korea data, and you look what China and South Korea did, you can see that their curves are not only blunted outside of Wuhan. So the Chinese areas outside of Wuhan, blunted curve; and South Korea, blunted curve. If you look at their curve today, they're already on the far end of their epidemic curve. Of course, none of those countries are fully back to work. And so that's what we worry about too.Secondly, there was a series of scientific articles published - and I know you've seen them too - about surface contamination. I think none of us really understood the level of surface piece. So we're still working out how much is it by human-human transmission and how much is it by surface. And this is why those fundamental guidelines were put out that says don't expose yourself to surfaces outside the home.Basically, what those guidelines are is: Don't expose yourself to excess number of persons who could be asymptomatic and infected - and then the person-to-person contact - and don't expose yourself to surfaces that could have had the virus on it for which on hard surfaces - I know we had the cardboard issue about shipping - hard surfaces, not shown in fabric as much or in cardboard, but hard surface transmission.These are issues that we haven't had to deal with before with a level of respiratory infections. And that's why we have this concern, and that's why the President put out the guidelines.And so it's to cover both of those pieces. That's all new science, all new models. I think many of you have the Imperial [sic] study available and looked at the impact of those. That's the first time those have been modeled as a comprehensive approach to mitigating an epidemic.
Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the administration looked at an executive order that would expand the use of investigational drugs against the virus, but that the FDA scientists are warning that this could put patients at risk.
Mr. President, we've shut down non-essential travel to Canada. Are you considering shutting down all travel to brunt the spread of the virus? And we've heard from industries, like the airlines who are seeking relief. What other industries - or what - how exactly is your administration going to determine which industries and businesses get the help?
Mr. President, I was struck by what Dr. Birx said about millennials and others perhaps not taking some of these warnings as seriously as you'd like. Some of those people also seem to be your supporters and conservatives who may be quoting some of what you said at the beginning of this, comparing it to the flu. What is your message to them to really follow what you've been saying so far? And are you concerned that they're still listening maybe to some of your earlier comments rather than your more recent ones?
Thank you, Mr. President. In talking about China, you've been very clear about who you think is to blame or where the origins of blame for this virus is.
I did, and they explained to me where they're coming from. I mean, they went from, as I said, full planes - packed, the best year they've ever had, by far - to, boom - one day, empty - because of what we have to do to get rid of - to win this war or we would have a level of deaths like people haven't seen before.So they've been fantastic. I mean, they've been great, but you know, they went from being extremely happy to being people that are running companies that are going to need some help. And we'll help them, Jennifer.
Well, it's going. I mean, there's a lot of influx to those loans, as you can imagine. A lot of people are looking at it. But we're going to be increasing funding a lot. They're very well prepared to do what they have to do and the SBA is doing a fantastic job. She is doing a really good job, the administrator.John?
- if I could. Dr. Birx, French researchers have had some luck with hydroxychloroquine in shortening the duration of disease. Is that something that might be in the arsenal of therapeutics here in the United States?
I think we're exploring every one of those issues. The President asked for a critical briefing on that today; he opened with that.It is more than that single drug. There are other drugs that individuals are looking at. Just to go back to what we've talked about many times, there is things that look really good in cell culture against the virus that may look good in small animals, and then don't have an impact in humans. And so those are the pieces that we're looking at very carefully. Of course, there's always anecdotal reports and we're trying to figure out how many anecdotal reports equal real scientific breakthroughs.
Are you confident of the seasonality of coronavirus?
All we can do is look at the past to inform the future. We know what SARS looked like. We also know - and I just want to put this out; I know you can get it online - look at the curve in China and look at the curve in South Korea. Those curves were accomplished in still the winter season. And so we're trying to understand what those relationships are. We're very interested in the curves in Italy because of their different approach and we're following every single country's curves.And so all we can do is look at prior coronavirus and prior respiratory infection RNA viruses. These are RNA viruses. When you look at flu in the Northern Hemisphere, when you look at parainfluenza and some of the other cold viruses, and if you look at SARS, that's the way the peak normally occurs.But that is a November to April. We all started later. And so you're asking me to predict based on a later start and that's what we're trying to really look at China and South Korea to really inform that.
Those that have needed to be tested, we believe we've caught most of them. Right now, we have 44 veterans who have tested positive. Sadly, one has passed in Portland. We are working with state labs and private companies to make sure that testing is available.Because the President had us out aggressively early, we have - we have been in a better place than most healthcare systems in the country. I cannot predict, as Dr. Birx said, when the next surge will be - if it will be.But one of the things that we do at VA is that we prepare for national emergencies, be they national disasters or epidemics. We started preparing for this. We started stockpiling equipment. Our equipment is stable. And I think that's in large part because of the instructions the President gave me.
I don't know exactly. I do know that 44 veterans have the virus. Most of those are quarantined at home.
Thank you, Mr. President. A question for Dr. Birx, quickly. I'm trying to understand what we - it's about the mortality rate. Yesterday, we underlined the fact that we had reached 100 deaths. And this morning, we wake up and we're at 110. Within 12 hours, we - we climbed by 10 percent. Is it something we have to expect from now on: a 10 percent increase every 12 hours?
So very early on in each one of these cases, if you look at all of the countries to date, the mortality is higher at the beginning because you're diagnosing the sickest - the ones who came in quite ill. And I just want to remind the American public that still the majority - the risk for serious illness in the majority of Americans are low. But that doesn't mean that you can't transmit it to one of those higher-risk groups, and that's why we're asking for all Americans to take responsibility.You're seeing mortality or deaths today from infections that occurred two to three weeks ago, in general. The other thing that you're seeing is the dramatic and very difficult impact of this virus in nursing homes.And that's why, very early on, the President and Vice President had us come out and CMS put those very strict rules in place and everybody thought we were being too strict and keeping loved ones away from their family in nursing homes. If we're going to solve this with a lower death rate, we have to protect the elderly because their percent is much higher in mortality than any other age group.
There's federal - there's reporting that the federal government has a plan that shows that this coronavirus outbreak might last as much - as long as 18 months. Are you seeing those numbers? Could this actually last -
And then the - my second question is, there are some - at least one White House official who used the term "Kung flu," referring to the fact that this virus started in China. Is that acceptable? Is it wrong? Are you worried that that having this virus be talked about as a "Chinese virus," that that might help -
- the "Kung flu" -
- term "Kung flu." My question is -
"Kung flu"?
- do you think that's wrong? "Kung flu." And do you think using the term "Chinese virus" - that puts Asian Americans at risk, that people might target them?
Switching gears to a larger question here. We've seen that before the pandemic there were a lot of Americans that were already alienated. We saw deaths of despair increasing through suicide and other things. Now, as these individuals, a lot of times in rural parts of the country, are self-isolating, what is your message to those individuals and what do you hope that individuals, communities, and churches will do to reach out to them?

Awareness among a Saudi Arabian university community of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus following an outbreak
ABSTRACT This study aimed to measure the level of awareness of faculty members, staff and students in a female Saudi Arabian university community towards Middle East respiratory syndrome coronvirus (MERS-CoV) following an outbreak. A self-administered questionnaire containing knowledge questions was distributed and completed by the 1541 participants. The overall knowledge score was 43.2%. It was only significantly higher in participants from the health colleges (50.6%). The majority (78.9%) of the respondents recognized the typical symptoms of MERS-CoV but only 67.1% knew the recommended preventive hygiene practices. Awareness of disease epidemiology, severity, fatality rate and treatment was very low. The knowledge of health care workers/students of the recommended precautions that should be applied when dealing with patients was poor (55.5%). Significant improvement in educational programmes for both the health care and non-health care professionals is warranted, particularly in crowded educational institutions or workplaces.
Sensibilisation d’une communauté universitaire saoudienne au coronavirus du syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient après une flambée
RÉSUMÉ La présente étude avait pour objectif de mesurer le niveau de sensibilisation du corps enseignant et étudiant, et du personnel d’une communauté universitaire saoudienne composée de femmes à l’égard du coronavirus du syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient (MERS-COV) après une flambée. Un auto-questionnaire comprenant des questions de connaissance a été distribué et rempli par 1541 participants. Le score général de connaissance était de 43,2 % et n’était significativement plus élevé que chez les participants issus de facultés de santé (50,6 %). La majorité des répondants (78,9 %) était capable d’identifier les symptômes caractéristiques du MERS-COV, mais seulement 67,1 % connaissaient les pratiques d’hygiène préventives recommandées. La sensibilisation à l’égard de l’épidémiologie, de la gravité, des taux de létalité et du traitement de la maladie était très basse. La connaissance des agents de santé et des étudiants en soins de santé portant sur les précautions recommandées qui devraient être appliquées lors de la prise en charge de patients était faible (55,5 %). Une amélioration significative des programmes de formation mis en œuvre à la fois pour les professionnels des soins et les professionnels extérieurs au milieu de la santé est requise, en particulier dans les lieux d’étude ou les environnements de travail avec une forte concentration de personnes.
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia (1). Since then cases have been reported worldwide. The syndrome comprises a viral respiratory illness which ranges in clinical presentation from a mild upper respiratory illness to rapidly progressive pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The largest outbreaks have been linked to overcrowding, delay in diagnosis and poor infection control practices. Chains of transmission can be interrupted by the implementation of control measures (2).
Awareness among the Saudi Arabian community of this infection has not been well established. Available studies are few and are limited by the small number of participants (3), reporting on participants' personal practices rather than the individual’s adherence to the current recommendations, and evaluating only minor aspects of public knowledge (3–5). In general, there is a lack of studies on the awareness and attitude of the Saudi Arabian public towards infectious diseases. Public awareness of infectious diseases aids significantly in infection control whereas a lack of reasonable knowledge leads to low detection rates, delayed treatment, discrimination and stigma (6).
It is important to assess the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of the public towards important and prevalent infectious diseases. Such information provides baseline data for the prevention and control of these diseases through estimation of the impact of previous prevention efforts made by the government and guiding the need for further interventions (6). Additionally, measuring the awareness of the public is valuable during an outbreak as appropriate public response during an outbreak is governed by the public’s understanding of disease transmission, availability of vaccines and effective medical treatment (7). Furthermore, the information obtained would be crucial to improving the communication efforts of public health officials and clinicians among the population at risk (8). Appropriate changes in public behaviour in response to an outbreak can alter the progression of the infectious agent (9).
The spread of infection in close contact environments, including crowded work or study places, can be hazardous and a high level of knowledge, particularly on preventive strategies, is paramount. Recently an outbreak occurred at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, the world’s largest all-female university: 4 cases of MERS-CoV infection were detected among the janitors (10). The 4 workers were quarantined and no MERS-CoV cases were reported amongst the students (11). The present study was designed to measure the awareness of MERS-CoV infection among the students, faculty members and other employees at the university following the outbreak.
A questionnaire was developed using the frequently asked questions posted on the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health websites (12,13). The questions and their correct responses are available on the websites both in Arabic and in English. The Arabic version was used to ensure better understanding among the participants. The term MERS-CoV in the original questions was replaced by “corona infection” as this is the term commonly used to refer to the syndrome in the local community. One question was developed in English and translated to Arabic using a published reference (2). The final questionnaire was reviewed for face validity by the expert panel of the research centre at the college of medicine and was pilot tested on 20 subjects from the target population, who were not included in the study. It was modified as necessary. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to be 0.7.
The questionnaire contained questions on participants’ demographic data, including age, level of education, occupation and college. There were 20 multiple choice knowledge questions that tested the following knowledge aspects in relation to MERS-CoV infection: disease epidemiology (3 questions); symptoms and incubation period (3 questions); possible infection sources, mode of transmission, and common places for outbreaks (6 questions), precautions and preventive strategies (4 questions); treatment and fatality rate (2 questions); and infection in special patient populations, including children and medically compromised individuals (2 questions). An additional question was addressed only to health care workers, including students or academic staff from the colleges of nursing, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and health and rehabilitation sciences who were in contact with patients. This question was analysed separately. The questions had 1 correct answer, 3 incorrect answers and a “don’t know” option.
Data were analysed using SAS, version 9.4. Only complete questionnaires were included in the analysis. The results of the knowledge questions were analysed using the answer key. The knowledge score for the whole sample was expressed as the percentage of correct answers of the 20 questions in the questionnaire. The last question was analysed only for participants from the 5 health colleges. Categorical variables are reported as number and percentage, and continuous variables are expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD). Comparison of scores between groups was based on analysis of variance, Kruskal–Wallis test, chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. The Bonferroni correction was applied to P-values obtained from pairwise comparisons between groups. P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The overall knowledge score was 43.2%. The scores of the assessed knowledge aspects were as follows: epidemiology (53.3%), symptoms recognition (45.5%), sources and mode of transmission (43.5%), precautions (43.2%), treatment and fatality rate (28.5%) and infection in special populations (38.4%) (Table 2).
Awareness of MERS-CoV symptoms, contagiousness and fatality rate
The responses to the knowledge questions are displayed in Table 3. The majority of the respondents (76.8%) were aware that MERS-CoV comprises a viral respiratory illness, and 78.9% correctly identified its typical symptoms. Most of the participants overestimated the contagiousness and fatality rate of MERS-CoV. 53.3% of the participants thought that the infection was highly contagious, and 22% thought it was moderately contagious. Only 14.3% correctly responded that it is contagious to a limited degree. 3.6% considered the syndrome non-contagious. 66.1% of the respondents exaggerated the infection fatality rate (6.6% considered the disease fatal in all cases, 31.3% thought it is fatal in 75% of the cases and 28.2% believed it was fatal in 50% of the cases.
Around two thirds of the participants knew the recommended general infection control precautions (Table 3); 7.6% thought that the latest medical consensus advice was not to touch surfaces and objects directly, 8.4% believed that they should wear a mask when leaving their home and 6.0% thought they should take antibiotics daily to avoid getting infected. Among the health care workers, only 55.3% correctly identified the precautions that should be applied when dealing with patients to prevent the transmission of infection (Table 3).
Table 4 shows the correlation between the participants’ occupation and knowledge score. There was no significant difference in the total mean knowledge score between students, non-academic staff and faculty members, (43.3% (SD 15.0), 41.8% (SD 16.7) and 46.4% (SD 20.3) respectively, (P = 0.104) although significant variability in some knowledge aspects was noted. The students had better knowledge of MERS-CoV symptoms and incubation period than the non-academic staff (Table 4) while the faculty members had better knowledge regarding treatment and fatality rate compared with both students and non-academic staff: 44.0% (SD 36.4), 28.2% (SD 33.1), and 25.7% (SD 30.2) respectively (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in regard to knowledge of the recommended precautionary measures against MERS-CoV infection, including the recommended daily precautions (P = 0.376).
Table 5 shows the correlation between MERS-CoV knowledge scores and the participants’ college. Participants from the health colleges had significantly better awareness in all tested knowledge aspects with a total score of 50.6% compared with 40.8%, 38.2% and 39.4% for the science, humanities/community colleges and non-specific college/preparatory year students respectively (P < 0.001). Participants from the science colleges had slightly better scores compared with their counterparts from the humanities and community colleges [40.8% (SD 15.1) versus 38.2% (SD 13.3), P = 0.028], however this was mainly due to better knowledge of the epidemiology of the infection.
Table 6 details the impact of the participant’s education level on their knowledge score. Participants with less than high school education had the lowest knowledge scores (27.5%) compared with the other participants [completed high school (43.2%), bachelor's degree (44.3%), masters' degree (43.4%), PhD or board certified (40.3%) (P = 0.002)]. Participants with less than high school education had the lowest knowledge scores for symptoms and incubation period of MERS-CoV, 11.9% (SD 16.6), compared with the other groups (P < 0.001).
When analysed by age, no significant difference was noted in the total scores of participants (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.04). When participants aged < 24 years were compared with those ≥ 24 years, there was little difference in the total knowledge scores, 43.2% (SD 15.1) versus 43.1% (SD 17.2) (P = 0.185). The younger participants were, however, more aware of MERS-CoV symptoms and incubation period, 46.6% (SD 25.7) versus 40.9% (SD 27.8) (P = 0.001), whereas the older participants had better knowledge of infection in special populations, 44.1% (SD 37.2) versus 37.0% (SD 32.9) P = 0.004) (data not shown).
This is the largest study to date on the awareness of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia. This study shows that the awareness of a sample of a Saudi Arabian university community regarding MERS-CoV infection following a recent outbreak is very poor. Knowledge of disease symptoms and recommended daily protective measures was relatively better, but remained suboptimal. The understanding of potential infection sources, fatality rate, treatment and WHO travel recommendations was deficient. Most of the respondents had a very low level of knowledge and some misconceptions were detected. The results also demonstrate that, although some variability was noted in knowledge about certain aspects of MERS-CoV between the groups, the total knowledge scores were similar. The total knowledge score was not affected by level of education (with the exception of in those with less than high school education) or age and was not significantly different between students, faculty members and non-academic staff. Only the college type significantly affected the total knowledge score, which was higher among members of the health colleges.
Additionally, this study measured the participants’ awareness towards disease aspects that are scientifically valid yet within public reach and knowledge level. The study explored new knowledge aspects, including disease epidemiology, infection sources, treatment and fatality rate, and used the WHO and Ministry of Health recommendations as the reference standard to gauge proper infection control practices. Our results are in accordance with previous studies. However, in addition to testing more knowledge aspects, we used a multiple choice question format rather than a true/false format, which may have posed some difficulty to the participants and this may explain the overall lower knowledge score observed in our sample (43.2%) compared with the findings of Al-Mohrej et al. (54%) (5).
Previous studies evaluating the awareness of the Saudi Arabian public towards MERS-CoV infection are limited (3–5). A study involving 1147 adult subjects in Riyadh reported a low level of knowledge of MERS-CoV incubation period, period of communicability and availability of vaccine, but a high level of knowledge on hygienic practices (4). Similar findings were reported in a study involving 1149 residents of Riyadh (5). That study, however, reported on the personal practices and precautions of the participants towards MERS-CoV rather than their awareness of the precautions recommended by health care authorities.
In another smaller study involving 200 dental students in Jeddah, 54% of the participants had a good level of knowledge regarding the etiology, symptoms, and treatment of MERS-CoV, and 79% were aware of the infection control and protection measures. Our findings are in agreement with these results, and similar to our study, the authors used the WHO recommendations as a reference standard for proper participant awareness and practices (3).
The good level of knowledge of proper hygienic practices observed in our sample and in other studies (3–5) is reassuring but remains suboptimal. Saudi Arabian communities still lack awareness of recommended protective measures that help prevent the transmission of the virus (14). It is estimated that 44 951 individuals older than 15 years may be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, and may be a source of infection for patients who have not been exposed to camels previously (15). A positive correlation has been demonstrated between contact with infected persons and infection risk, i.e. contacts are most in need of education on MERS-CoV to avoid spread of infection (14). Precautionary activities are therefore of great importance in avoiding infection and should be strengthened.
Health care workers/students, on the other hand, had poor knowledge of the recommended infection control precautions in the health care setting. This observation has important clinical implications as it may explain the high incidence of outbreaks and clustering of cases observed in the medical field. Our results on the health care workers/students’ awareness are in accordance with those reported previously by Al-Ghamdi et al. who reported a very low level of awareness (32.9%) regarding the preventive measures against influenza A (H1N1) among health care workers during Hajj (16). They found that health care workers (especially non-physicians, those with fewer years of experience and those who were not aware of the guidelines) had difficulties in some preventive measures and highlighted the importance of training courses (16).
One of the early reports on MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia described mild or asymptomatic infection in 7 health care workers who did not follow proper infection control procedures in patient care. The workers had no previous contact with animals (17). The close proximity of health care workers to patients and the handling of human biologic material (sputum, respiratory secretions, etc.) likely increase their infection risk and consequently infection transmission in hospitals (17). Our results suggest that the lack of proper hygiene practices may be primarily due to poor awareness rather than noncompliance.
There are limited data on public awareness of infectious diseases in Saudi Arabia. The available studies, however, are consistent in reporting low knowledge level and poor adoption of protective measures (7,18–20). In a study on the awareness of the Saudi Arabian public towards H1N1 infection, 43.7% of the studied population were reported to have low knowledge level, and 60.8% had taken no or minimal precautionary measures (7). Potential explanations for the poor awareness include the lacking of proper health education among the Saudi Arabian people (21) and people’s neglect of Ministry of Health recommendations (7).
Following the outbreak at the university, awareness programmes were implemented (10) and educational posters and banners were distributed on campus. Our results, however, indicate that these measures may be inadequate. The Saudi Arabian public commonly derive their information from the internet, but physicians and other health care providers are considered the preferred source of information (14). Live lectures provided by physicians or other health care providers may, therefore, be more influential and have a greater impact on public knowledge. Frequent communication between physicians and the public helps dispel myths about the disease and clarifies the role that the public can play in limiting disease spread (7).
The Ministry of Health has implemented a series of preventive measures to limit the spread of MERS-CoV, including organizing conferences, holding meetings and television interviews in addition to issuing press releases on a regular basis and using text messages sent via mobile phones to update the public on new developments (5). It is not clear however if these messages are reaching the general population and increasing their awareness (14) and evaluation of these educational methods should be performed. Raising public awareness should be achieved through scientific health education and without creating anxiety and fear in the community, which might increase anxiety and demands on health services unnecessarily (22). A policy that shifts the emphasis from detection and outbreak response to prevention of infection at source is recommended and is expected to result in better protection of animal and human health and the economy (23).
Raising the level of knowledge of infectious diseases not only helps the general population protect themselves, but also encourages those suspected of being infected to seek medical help early and be treated more completely (24). Evidence suggests that educational intervention through educational leaflets, group and individual discussions, visual show and lectures is associated with improvement in the knowledge scores on infectious disease in the Saudi Arabian community as well as attitudes and practices (18). This can be provided in colleges, schools and work places. The media and the Internet are also considered important sources of information in the Saudi Arabian community (3,14) and can be used to target a wider sector of the community, including those at home. It should be emphasized that it is important to raise awareness among both the medical community and the general public to eliminate the factors that contribute to infection outbreaks (25).
Our findings emphasize the low public awareness of preventive measures for infectious diseases, and may serve as a reference point to guide future education programmes.

Fourth Person Tests Positive for Coronavirus in Illinois: IDPH
A fourth Illinois patient has tested positive for the new coronavirus, COVID-19, state health officials announced...Read more
A fourth Illinois patient has tested positive for the new coronavirus, COVID-19, state health officials announced Monday.
The woman in her 70s is the spouse of a man, also in his 70s, who tested positive over the weekend in a Chicago suburb, the Illinois Department of Public Health said in a release.
Health officials said both patients were in "good condition." The woman is being quarantined at home and "is complying with health officials."
"Public health officials are working to identify and actively monitor individuals who were in contact with both patients in an effort to prevent additional transmission," the Illinois Department of Public Health said in a statement. "Public health officials will reach out to individuals who may have been exposed."
Meanwhile, the hospital treating the woman's spouse said Monday that the person remains hospitalized in isolation.
Northwest Community Healthcare said infectious disease specialists are at the hospital "working closely with communicable disease officials from the Cook County Department of Public Health, the Illinois Department of Public Health and the CDC."
Arlington Heights Hospital Treating Coronavirus Patient, Local School Issues Letter
Employees in an Arlington Heights school district are staying home after a relative of their babysitter was exposed to a coronavirus patient. Kye Martin has the latest as the situation in the Chicago suburb continues to develop.
"NCH is closely following recommended guidelines outlined by these officials," the hospital said in a statement. "At the moment we are implementing all associated protocols, including an exposure investigation, to identify those who might have had contact with this patient in order to treat them accordingly. Along with this patient, our top priority will remain to keep our staff and community safe at all times."
The latest case marks the fourth person in Illinois to test positive for the coronavirus, Cook County and state health officials said in a news release.
Though tests for the latest patient, which were conducted in Illinois, came back with positive results for the new coronavirus, COVID-19, the results for both cases have yet to be confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease for Control and Prevention, officials said.

US Ups Travel Restrictions as Trump Says More Coronavirus Cases ‘Likely’
Public health officials said they're working to identify and actively monitor individuals who were in contact with the patient in an effort to reduce the risk of additional transmission.
School District 25 in the Arlington Heights said in a letter Sunday that two staff members and their children were contacted by a babysitter whose relative, a hospital employee, had been exposed to the coronavirus patient. The staff members and their children work at or attend Dryden, Ivy Hill, Greenbrier and Olive Mary Stitt schools, the district said.
Though none of the employees or their children have experienced symptoms, the district said the group was staying home to self-monitor.
"I’ve been working directly with the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) and the Village of Arlington Heights," Superintendent Lori Bein said in a statement. "CCDPH has informed me that there is nothing additional that District 25 should do at this time."
Bein urged students who are sick to stay home until at least 24 hours after they no longer show signs of a fever and reminded staff and families of basic health precautions to take, like washing your hands and covering your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.

The Illinois Primary Health Care Association said the state's community health centers are working with the World Health Organization, the CDC and IDPH to "ensure accurate protocols and communication plans are in place."
"Health centers are educating their staff and patients about the prevention and spread of COVID-19 to help mitigate the risk of a potential spread," the association said in a statement.
In January, two Chicago residents, a husband and wife, were diagnosed with the coronavirus. The wife had recently traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, to care for a relative.
Both patients were treated at AMITA Health St. Alexius Medical Center in Hoffman Estates and have since made a full recovery.
On Saturday, the new coronavirus claimed its first victim inside the U.S. as the White House announced additional travel restrictions on international travel to prevent its spread.
Last month, Illinois became the first state to conduct its own tests for the coronavirus, allowing for quicker results.
On Monday, officials said Pritzker requested that hospitals across the state implement additional testing to "improve surveillance for COVID-19."
The Illinois Department of Public Health launched a statewide hotline for the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, "to answer any questions from the public or to report a suspected case," Pritzker said. That number is 1 (800) 889-3931.

Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said there hasn't been a death associated with the new coronavirus in an infant, and she again urged people to do all they can to prevent the spread of the virus.
The risk of death and severe illness from COVID-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization.
Children have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with COVID-19.

The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure, and died four weeks after being hospitalized.
Separate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year old. The study found less than 6% of children were seriously ill. "A full investigation is underway to determine the cause of death,” Dr. Ezike said in a news release. “We must do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. If not to protect ourselves, but to protect those around us.”
The deaths announced Saturday in Illinois also included an employee with the Illinois Department of Human Services.
An additional 465 coronavirus cases were also reported, bringing the state total to 3,491 with 47 deaths.

Navy hospital ship won’t be ready to help New York for weeks, Pentagon says
The Pentagon said Wednesday that a Navy hospital ship intended to supplement New York hospitals dealing with coronavirus cases will not be ready for weeks.
The USNS Comfort and its West Coast twin, the USNS Mercy, are nearly three football fields long and 10 stories high, making them indisputably the largest hospital ships in the world.
The hospital ship USNS Comfort is anchored off the coast of La Brea, Trinidad and Tobago as the ship prepares for a five-day medical mission.
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said Wednesday that a Navy hospital ship intended to help New York hospitals dealing with a rapidly expanding load of coronavirus cases will not be ready for weeks.
Earlier Wednesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said President Donald Trump agreed to send the USNS Comfort hospital ship to help with coronavirus cases, expected to surge in the next 45 days.
The Comfort and the Mercy are nearly three football fields long and 10 stories high, making them indisputably the largest hospital ships in the world. The Comfort’s home port is Norfolk, Virginia, and the Mercy’s is San Diego, California.
The vessels, which were transformed from hulking oil tankers into 1,000-bed hospital ships, are equipped with 12 operating rooms, a blood bank, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab and a CAT-scan.
Both ships have side ports to take on patients at sea as well as helicopter decks for air transport. The ships are so massive, each would be tantamount to the fourth-biggest hospital in the U.S. 
Military Sealift Command hospital ship USNS Mercy (T-AH 19).
Cuomo on Wednesday warned that coronavirus cases threaten to overwhelm the state’s hospital bed capacity.
As of Wednesday morning, the number of people infected with the coronavirus in New York state rose to more than 2,300, he added. Of those cases, nearly 23% are hospitalized.

From the closing of borders to mandatory quarantines, governments around the world are taking drastic steps to try to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
Past outbreaks provide a blueprint for governments navigating the challenges of COVID-19, which has spread to more than 200,000 people worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Pandemics such as the 1918 influenza offer one key takeaway: Clear communication from the federal government is key. —Elizabeth Schulze
12:18 pm: Amazon sellers brace for layoffs and worse after coronavirus-related products get priority
Amazon sellers are expecting the worst after the company said this week it will prioritize shipments of household staples, medical supplies and other coronavirus-related product over everything else.
In addition to household staples and medical supplies, Amazon told sellers it’s prioritizing categories such as baby products, health and household, beauty and personal care, grocery, industrial and scientific and pet supplies.
Amazon’s decision will help serve shoppers who need to buy toilet paper, disinfectant wipes and other coronavirus-related items, but it threatens to put third-party sellers who don’t offer those products in a major bind for at least the next few weeks. Many small retailers rely on Amazon to sell their products online, and the hit to sales has caused some to furlough or lay off employees to soften the blow. —Annie Palmer
11:48 am: Gov. Cuomo says he won’t approve coronavirus ‘shelter-in-place’ order for New York City after mayor tells residents to prepare
“That is not going to happen — shelter in place, for New York City,” Cuomo said on The Daily podcast by The New York Times. “For any city or county to take an emergency action, the state has to approve it. And I wouldn’t approve ‘shelter in place.’” —Will Feuer
11:39 am: Mnuchin vows to prevent 20% unemployment in coronavirus response
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC the U.S. will not have 20% unemployment — a figure he reportedly warned Republican senators about in a private briefing — if they follow the Trump administration’s coronavirus plan.
Stocks tumbled as the markets remained highly volatile with the government response to the coronavirus fallout still unfolding. A violent reversal in Treasury yields in response to a potential $1 trillion stimulus package unnerved investors.
Honda North America and BMW are closing plants throughout the U.S. and Europe this week due to an anticipated decline in demand for cars related to the global coronavirus outbreak. Honda said it will be closing four U.S.-based plants for six days starting Monday due to an anticipated decline in market demand.
11:15 am: Coronavirus will infect half the global population, EIU predicts
The new coronavirus will infect half of the global population and have a fatality rate of up to 3%, analysts said.
“We assume that the virus will infect around 50% of the world population; 20% of the cases will be severe, and 1-3% will result in deaths,” analysts from the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a note.
As a result of the pandemic, the EIU predicted global growth would stand at just 1% for 2020 — down from its outlook of 2.3% before the outbreak began. It would mark the lowest rate in global gross domestic product growth since the global financial crisis, analysts noted. —Chloe Taylor
11:01 am: Coronavirus lives for hours in air particles and days on surfaces, new US study shows
A microscopic view of novel coronavirus.
The new coronavirus can survive for several hours in air particles and last days on surfaces, according to a new federally funded study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Researchers from the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UCLA and Princeton University examined how long COVID-19 survives in the air as well as on copper, cardboard, plastic and stainless steel and then compared it with SARS, the coronavirus that emerged in late 2002 and killed nearly 800 people.
They found that COVID-19 was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, and up to 24 hours on cardboard. The new coronavirus can also last up to three days on plastic and stainless steel, the scientists concluded, adding the amount of the virus left on those surfaces decreases over time. —Berkeley Lovelace Jr.
In Italy, a good Samaritan could be facing legal action for providing a hospital with special valves needed for breathing equipment that keeps coronavirus patients alive, according to a report from Techdirt.
Cristian Fracassi used a 3D printer to make the valves after the original manufacturer could not provide them due to overwhelming demand. Fracassi had to design the valves himself after the manufacturer refused to provide the 3D files, and he ultimately donated more than 100 valves to the hospital, each one costing him around $1 to make.
The regular listing price of the valve is about $11,000, and the manufacturer has threatened to sue Fracassi for patent infringement, leaving him fearful of sharing the 3D file with other hospitals that need the valve. —Hannah Miller
10:43 am: With Europe now the coronavirus epicenter, fears rise over a break up of the euro zone

The White House and Congress are scrambling to hash out the details of a massive stimulus package to help a U.S. economy increasingly damaged by the coronavirus pandemic.
Russian media have deployed a “significant disinformation campaign” against the West to worsen the impact of the coronavirus, generate panic and sow distrust, according to a European Union document seen by Reuters.
The EU document said the Russian campaign, pushing fake news online in English, Spanish, Italian, German and French, uses contradictory, confusing and malicious reports to make it harder for the EU to communicate its response to the pandemic. —Reuters

Former Federal Reserve chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen recommend that the central bank continue trying to shore up the economy against the coronavirus threat, even suggesting that it go beyond the powers it currently enjoys.
As countries around the world grapple with COVID-19, front line medical workers are deploying robots, telemedicine, and other technologies to help contain the pandemic. China and Spain have used drones to monitor people during lockdown campaigns, while South Korea has deployed them to help disinfect areas in Daegu, an epidemic hotspot.
Antwork, a group company of Japanese industrial drone maker Terra Drone, flew medical samples and quarantine materials in China’s Xinchang in February during the height of the epidemic.
Earlier this month, a field hospital staffed by robots opened in the Hongshan Sports Center in Wuhan, China, where the pandemic began. Dubbed the Smart Field Hospital, the facility is a project involving Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, China Mobile, and CloudMinds, a maker of cloud robotics systems based in China and the U.S. The Smart Field Hospital is a trial aimed at relieving exhausted health-care workers even as the outbreak in China slowed in recent weeks. —Tim Hornyak
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma said the Trump administration’s move to expand telemedicine is critical for all American seniors, even those who are experiencing health issues unrelated to the coronavirus. “They don’t have to travel. They don’t have to sit in a waiting room,” she said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” For seniors who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, it also allows them to communicate with their doctors without the risk of spreading it to others. “It is a game changer,” she said. —Kevin Stankiewicz
Mayo Clinic CEO Gianrico Farrugia said the U.S. could have enough ventilators to treat critical COVID-19 patients if Americans take social distancing seriously enough. “There’s a significant supply of ventilators. They may not always be in the right place,” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” While it’s impossible to predict how many the U.S. will need, Farrugia said the “less cases we have in the United States, the less ventilators we’re going to need, and if we can space that over time then I do think we’ll have enough ventilators.” —Kevin Stankiewicz

Worldwide coronavirus cases top 200,000, doubling in two weeks
COVID-19 cases surpassed 200,000 worldwide on Wednesday as the new coronavirus continues to spread outside of China, the original epicenter of the outbreak.
COVID-19 cases surpassed 200,000 worldwide on Wednesday as the new coronavirus continues to spread outside of China, the original epicenter of the outbreak.
The total number of cases now stands at 201,436 as of 7:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday, according to data compiled by John Hopkins. The virus emerged in Wuhan, China in December. It has since spread to most countries around the world, according to the World Health Organization.
The virus has now killed more than 8,000 people around the world, according to JHU, but more than 82,000 people have recovered from the virus.
Almost half of all cases in the world are in China, but the virus, known as COVID-19, has quickly spread across borders. Last week, the WHO declared that Europe had become the new epicenter of the virus.
“More cases are now being reported [in Europe] every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. 
Italy, where officials have implemented a nationwide lockdown, has reported more than 31,000 cases, according to JHU, and over 2,500 deaths. The virus has infected more than 16,000 people in Iran, JHU’s data shows, and over 13,000 in Spain.
The WHO declared the virus a global pandemic last week.
“In the past two weeks the number of cases outside China has increased thirteenfold and the number of affected countries has tripled,” Tedros said. “In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths and the number of affected countries to climb even higher.”
The WHO has criticized responses by some countries for failing to communicate clearly with their population, not taking proactive containment measures and not committing politically to combat the virus. 
“Some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resources. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve,” Tedros said after declaring the virus a pandemic.
Wondering if insurance will cover the coronavirus - here is what you need to know
To curb the spread of the virus, governments across the world are closing schools, restricting travel and ordering people to remain in their homes. European leaders agreed Tuesday to close the European Union’s external borders for 30 days. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump declared a similar travel ban on most European countries.
“We don’t have any time. The numbers are showing that there has been a significant growth in infections, people in intensive care and deaths,” Italian Prime Minister Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at the time. “Our habits have to change right now. We must give things up for Italy.”

WHO officials enroll first patients from Norway and Spain in ‘historic’ coronavirus drug trial
The first patients in a “historic” drug trial to test treatments for the coronavirus have been enrolled in Norway and Spain, World Health Organization officials announced Friday.
World health officials are testing four of the most promising drugs to fight COVID-19, including malaria medications chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, an antiviral compound called Remdesivir, a combination of HIV drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir and a combination of those drugs plus interferon-beta.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), speaks during a news conference on the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday, March 2, 2020.
The first patients in a “historic” drug trial to test treatments for the coronavirus have been enrolled in Norway and Spain, World Health Organization officials announced Friday.
World health officials are testing four of the most promising drugs to fight COVID-19, including malaria medications chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, an antiviral compound called Remdesivir, a combination of HIV drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir and a combination of those drugs plus interferon-beta.
“There are no more than half a million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 20,000 deaths. These are tragic numbers,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference at the organization’s headquarters in Geneva. “But remember that more than 100,000 have recovered. We must fight, unite and ignite. We are one humanity with one common enemy.”
Chloroquine -- and its derivative hydroxychloroquine --  are a decades-old drug and were found in a small study in France to be helpful in clearing the coronavirus from patients compared to a control group. President Donald Trump has repeatedly touted the drugs as potential treatments. However, experts say the findings of the study were not definitive and more trials are needed.
Scientists have also been looking at HIV drugs as possible treatments. Remdesivir is produced by Gilead Sciences. Some health authorities in the U.S. and China have been using the drug through so-called compassionate use programs in hopes that the drug can reduce the duration of the virus in patients.
There are no proven therapies to treat COVID-19 but there are a number of clinical trials that are ongoing, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, told reporters Friday.
WHO officials also urged countries to stop using medicines that are not proven to be effective against COVID-19. They did not name any particular drug, but a number of people have been experimentally using chloroquine combined with Azithromycin to prevent and treat COVID-19.
Tedros said that a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is still likely 12 to 18 months away. WHO has been working closely with the National Institutes of Health, which has been fast-tracking work with biotech company Moderna to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19. They began their first human trials in the U.S. on a potential vaccine last week.
The potential vaccine by Moderna contains genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA, that was produced in a lab. The mRNA is a genetic code that tells cells how to make a protein and was found in the outer coat of the new coronavirus, according to researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute.

How the rich are self-isolating from the coronavirus
Luxury bunkers and private islands — how the rich are self-isolating from the coronavirus
While most of us will have to settle for self-isolation in our own home or apartment, the rich are hunkering down in state-of-the-art bunkers and fleeing to private islands to escape the coronavirus. 
Since the outbreak at the end of last year, more than 533,000 people around the world have been infected with the highly-contagious coronavirus, while at least 24,000 people have died, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
Larry Hall, owner of another U.S.-based bunker maker, Survival Condo, said he had also seen a spike in enquiries due to the outbreak, as many said the coronavirus had made buying a unit more of a priority. 
Others have been in search of a bit more open space, choosing to put a seas distance between themselves and the virus, by snapping up their own secluded island. 
“It’s probably the safest place on the planet for anybody wanting to hide from this horrible virus because it’s 20 miles off the mainland, it’s on the reef,” said Krolow. 
Krolow said he had also received an influx of calls last week from people on yachts, literally circling islands “trying to find a safe place to go and willing to pay a premium.” 
He had booked one seven-week charter and another four-week charter for families opting to see out the pandemic on board a yacht.

Four dead on Carnival-owned cruise ship amid new coronavirus outbreak aboard
The company, which is owned by parent Carnival Corp., also announced that two people on board tested positive for COVID-19.
The Zaandam cruise ship enters the Panama City Bay to be assisted by the Rotterdam cruise ship with supplies, personnel and COVID-19 testing devices, at 8 milles from Panama City, on March 27, 2020.
Four passengers died aboard Holland America’s “Zaandam” cruise ship and two people on board tested positive for the coronavirus, the company announced Friday.
The company, which is owned by parent Carnival Corp., did not say how many passengers and crew were tested but said 53 passengers and 85 crew members are exhibiting symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. There are more than 1,800 people aboard the ship, the company said, adding that four doctors and four nurses are also on board.
The Zaandam, which is currently anchored off the coast of Panama, is now at least the third Carnival-owned ship to become the site of a coronavirus outbreak. 
The company said in a statement that “four older guests have passed away on Zaandam,” but did not specify whether they died of COVID-19. “No one has been off the ship since March 14 in Punta Arenas, Chile.”
Another Holland America ship, the “Rotterdam,” met the Zaandam at sea on Thursday, the company said, adding that it plans to transfer healthy patients from one ship to the other before they are exposed to COVID-19. All passengers and crew currently exhibiting symptoms will remain on the Zaandam. The company said it is following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The ship departed Buenos Aires on March 7 for a voyage that was meant to end in Chile on March 21. While the ship was at sea, Holland America “made the decision to suspend its global cruise operations for 30 days and end its current cruises in progress as quickly as possible so guests could return home.”
However, the ship’s passengers and crew were barred from disembarking in Chile and struggled to find any open ports amid the coronavirus pandemic. The company said the ship is now en route to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. However, representatives of the Panama Canal Authority said at first that the ship would not be allowed to pass through the canal with confirmed COVID-19 patients on board.
“Following protocol of Panama’s Ministry of Health, if a vessel has individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 on board, it cannot make any port operations or transit the Canal,” the Panama Canal Authority said in a statement. However, the organization said later on Saturday that the ship was granted approval to pass through the canal.
“The Panama Canal is preparing to facilitate the transit of the Zaandam through the waterway, after receiving authorization from Panama’s Ministry of Health,” the Panama Canal Authority said in a statement.
Perhaps no industry has been hit worse by the coronavirus pandemic than the cruise industry. Passengers have fallen ill and died as cruise ships become the sites of epidemics. In response, ports have denied vessels entry, travelers have canceled trips and the largest cruise companies in the world have suspended operations. The State Department even directed Americans to not travel by cruise ship amid the pandemic.
The CDC published a report earlier this week that said confirmed COVID-19 cases were traced back to at least 25 cruise ships around the world. 
Of the largest cruise companies in the world, Carnival Corp. is perhaps the hardest hit. One of its ships, the Diamond Princess, had one of the largest clusters of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of China with more than 700 infected passengers and crew. The Diamond Princess and its 3,700 passengers and crew were quarantined at a Japanese port on Feb. 4 after a previous guest, who didn’t have any symptoms while aboard the ship, tested positive for the virus.
Earlier this month, U.S. officials announced 21 confirmed COVID-19 cases on another Carnival-owned ship, the Grand Princess, which was moored off the coast of California. The ship had roughly 3,500 passengers and crew on board. After several days, California officials brought the ship to the Port of Oakland, where passengers disembarked and were transported to federal quarantine facilities.

Slack CEO to employees amid COVID-19: ‘Don’t stress about work’
Here’s how big your emergency fund should be during the COVID-19 pandemic
How the rich are self-isolating from the coronavirus
Do you need more than 3 to 6 months’ worth of expenses saved during the COVID-19 pandemic? Here’s what experts say
Financial advisors generally encourage you to set aside three to six months’ worth of living expenses in an emergency fund in case you lose your job, have a medical scare or have to deal with a car breaking down. 
Does this rule of thumb still apply today, as the COVID-19 pandemic threatens the global economy and is projected to put millions of Americans out of work? 
CNBC Make It turned to certified financial planners Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz and Kelly Crane to help you figure out how big of a cash cushion to have as coronavirus uncertainty persists. 
If you’re far out from retirement and have a steady job, keeping three to six months’ worth of expenses in an emergency fund is fine, says Schwab-Pomerantz. That way, you’ll have a sizable buffer in case you need it, but “you won’t have so much in cash that you lose the opportunity for growth.” 
You want your emergency fund to be readily available, which means keeping it in a savings account. But savings accounts, even the high-yield ones, aren’t going to allow for as much growth as investing could. By keeping three to six months’ worth of expenses in a savings account, you strike a good balance between having enough to cover you in a bind, but not sacrificing potential growth you’d earn from investing your money.
If your income fluctuates depending on commissions, overtime pay or other external factors, ideally you’ll save closer to six months’ worth of expenses — or more, adds Schwab-Pomerantz.
Regardless of your job, though, having a minimum of three months’ worth of expenses saved is especially important right now. “These are unprecedented global economic times,” Crane says. “Get real about the chances of losing any or all of your income and plan for at least three months of disruption to that income source.”
“The length of this disruption is the big unknown,” he says. “The virus could impact us for a few more weeks or, for some industries, for many months. The less stable your income is and the harder it could be to get another job in your industry right now, the more you need to be liquid.”
Aim to have at least three months’ worth of expenses saved, but when setting your specific emergency fund goal, ask yourself: How much do I need to feel comfortable?

White House told federal health agency to classify coronavirus deliberations, sources say
The White House has ordered federal health officials to treat top-level coronavirus meetings as classified, an unusual step that has restricted information and hampered the U.S. government’s response to the contagion, according to four Trump administration officials. 
The officials said that dozens of classified discussions about such topics as the scope of infections, quarantines and travel restrictions have been held since mid-January in a high-security meeting room at the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), a key player in the fight against the coronavirus.
World Health Organization chief declares the coronavirus a global pandemic
The White House insistence on secrecy at the nation’s premier public health organization, which has not been previously disclosed, has put a lid on certain information - and potentially delayed the response to the crisis. COVID19, the disease caused by the virus, has killed about 30 people in the United States and infected more than 1,000 people.
HHS oversees a broad range of health agencies, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which among other things is responsible for tracking cases and providing guidance nationally on the outbreaks.
An NSC spokesman did not respond to questions about the meetings at HHS. But he defended the administration’s transparency across federal agencies and noted that meetings of the administration’s task force on the coronavirus all are unclassified. It was not immediately clear which meetings he was referring to.
“From day one of the response to the coronavirus, NSC has insisted on the principle of radical transparency,” said the spokesman, John Ullyot. He added that the administration “has cut red tape and set the global standard in protecting the American people under President Trump’s leadership.”
Critics have hammered the Trump administration for what they see as a delayed response to coronavirus outbreaks and a lack of transparency, including sidelining experts and providing misleading or incomplete information to the public. State and local officials also have complained of being kept in the dark about essential federal response information.

5 tips for effectively working from home during the coronavirus outbreak, when you have kids
As a result of the coronavirus outbreak, at least 69,000 schools across the U.S. have been closed or are scheduled to close, according to Education Week, which published a state-by-state map tracking school closures across the country. 
For thousands of parents who have been asked to work remotely, this means extra challenges when trying to balance the demands of work life and home life while coronavirus remains a concern. 
It can also be helpful to create a spreadsheet with your manager and the rest of your team, where you each outline your emergency contact information and your availability for virtual meetings. 
Nearly 90% of American workers say that taking a lunch break helps them to feel refreshed and ready to get back to work, according to the “Take Back the Lunch Break” survey released by global health and hygiene brand Tork. 
“Breaks are important when working at home,” says Kratz. She suggests that for every hour of focused work you complete, you take at least a 10 minute break to grab a snack, walk around or say “hi” to your kids. She also adds that a quick at-home yoga session, a hot shower or indulging in your favorite podcasts are other self-care things you can do when taking a healthy break from work.

Supreme Court postpones arguments because of coronavirus, citing Spanish flu precedent
The Supreme Court said Monday it will postpone arguments scheduled for March and early April because of health concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic.
The top court cited its actions during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and the yellow fever outbreaks of the 18th century as precedents. 
The Supreme Court said Monday it will postpone arguments scheduled for March and early April, including cases regarding access to President Donald Trump’s financial records, because of health concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic.
The court cited its actions during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and the yellow fever outbreaks of the 18th century as precedents. 
Some of the court’s nine justices are particularly susceptible to the infection, which public health officials have said disproportionately impacts older people and those with chronic health conditions. Six of the justices are 65-years-old or older. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the eldest on the panel, just turned 87 on Sunday and has suffered from multiple bouts of cancer.
“The Court’s postponement of argument sessions in light of public health concerns is not unprecedented,” the court said. “The Court postponed scheduled arguments for October 1918 in response to the Spanish flu epidemic. The Court also shortened its argument calendars in August 1793 and August 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks.”
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a state of emergency on Wednesday as the number of infections in the nation’s capital rose. The district has also begun enforcing new regulations on bars and restaurants, including the suspension of standing service and restrictions on table seating. 
There have been at least 3,774 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. and at least 69 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The District of Columbia has confirmed 18 cases, according to the data. 
“In keeping with public health precautions recommended in response to COVID-19, the Supreme Court is postponing the oral arguments currently scheduled for the March session (March 23-25 and March 30-April 1). The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances.
The Building will continue to be open for official business, and filing deadlines are not extended under Rule 30.1. The Court is expanding remote working capabilities to reduce the number of employees in the Building, consistent with public health guidance. The Building will remain closed to the public until further notice.
The Court’s postponement of argument sessions in light of public health concerns is not unprecedented. The Court postponed scheduled arguments for October 1918 in response to the Spanish flu epidemic. The Court also shortened its argument calendars in August 1793 and August 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks.”
Correction: This story was updated to correct that the Spanish flu epidemic was in 1918.

CEO of multibillion-dollar company Slack to employees amid coronavirus: ‘Don’t stress about work’
As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads throughout the United States and the world, Butterfield told employees on Friday (via Slack of course), “We got this. Take care of yourselves, take care of your families, be a good partner. It is fine to work irregular or reduced hours. It is fine to take time out when you need it,” he said.
The news is worse and worse. The pandemic spread further into France and Spain. Lockdowns started across the US. Several realities are starting to sink in.
His message to staff comes as the pandemic has ushered in a period of rapid growth for the messaging app company. As businesses around the world quickly transitioned to remote work to “flatten the curve” of coronavirus’ spread, Slack became an increasingly essential communication tool and landed big accounts, Butterfield said. 
During the worst pandemic in modern history and record-breaking volatility in the market, how company executives react will be scrutinized, according to Mark Cuban.

Extenuating circumstances policy and the coronavirus (COVID-19)
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. Since then, the outbreak has evolved rapidly with governments around the world taking swift action to slow the spread of COVID-19.
In response, we are providing the following coverage for COVID-19 under our extenuating circumstances policy to help protect our community and provide peace of mind. Please monitor this page for updates about coverage.
Domestic reservations in mainland China are covered under the existing mainland China extenuating circumstances for COVID-19 statement. Luxe or Luxury Retreats reservations are covered under the Luxe Guest Refund Policy.
Reservations for stays and Airbnb Experiences made on or before March 14, 2020, with a check-in date after April 14, 2020, are not currently covered for COVID-19 related extenuating circumstances. The host’s cancellation policy will apply as usual.
Reservations for stays and Airbnb Experiences made after March 14, 2020 will not be covered under our extenuating circumstances policy, except where the guest or host is currently sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 related circumstances not covered include: transportation disruptions and cancellations; travel advisories and restrictions; health advisories and quarantines; changes to applicable law; and other government mandates—like evacuation orders, border closures, prohibitions on short-term rentals, and shelter-in-place requirements. The host’s cancellation policy will apply as usual.
Our extenuating circumstances policy is intended to protect guests and hosts from unforeseen circumstances that arise after booking. After the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, the extenuating circumstances policy will no longer apply because COVID-19 and its consequences are no longer unforeseen or unexpected. Please remember to carefully review the host's cancellation policy when booking and consider choosing an option that provides flexibility.

We’ve curated articles to help our community during this time in the Resource Center. You can find the latest information on our COVID-19 response, from policy updates to resources for hosts and guests. Some of these include:

On Feb. 28, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer activated the State Emergency Operations Center to maximize coordination with state, local and federal agencies, as well as private partners, and to help prevent the spread of the disease. The administration continues to work with schools, businesses, medical providers and local health departments to make sure they have the information and resources they need to collaboratively address this health crisis. MDHHS also launched a campaign to raise awareness of appropriate hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other illnesses.
As part of Michigan’s efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19, Governor Whitmer created four task forces on Tuesday, March 3: 
The COVID-19 Task Force on State Operations, covering all aspects of state operations, including employment and facilities.
The COVID-19 Task Force on Health and Human Services, covering the provision of medical and human services, including protecting the healthcare workforce. 
The COVID-19 Task Force on Education, covering K-12 public schools and universities and colleges.
The COVID-19 Task Force on Economy/Workforce, covering general economic impact, workforce, supply chain, business continuity, and related issues. 
Since then, task forces have been meeting to go over response plans and determine potential resource needs to respond to COVID-19.  On Tuesday, March 10, Governor Whitmer declared a state of emergency as Michigan’s first positive cases of COVID-19 were identified. The emergency declaration now enables the state to quickly deploy state resources (equipment, supplies and/or personnel) to local jurisdictions that request resources to support their response efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19. The declaration places Michigan at a heightened state or preparedness for response. It does not change the authority of law enforcement or implement restrictions on residents. However, all Michiganders are encouraged to follow the recommendations from MDHHS and the CDC to protect themselves and slow the spread of COVID-19.
MDHHS continues to participate in national calls to stay up to date on the national investigation and response, and is implementing all CDC disease prevention guidance. MDHHS will continue to update statewide healthcare providers with this information as it is received.

To help Michiganders receive unemployment benefits as a result of COVID-19, the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) has developed a schedule for workers to file for benefits based on the first letter of their last name. The agency continues to see a historical increase in working families seeking emergency financial relief and this new schedule will improve functionally, accessibility and help alleviate bottlenecks in both the online system - Michigan.gov/UIA - and over the phone at 866-500-0017.  
The day or time of day in which a claim is filed will not impact whether a worker receives benefits or their benefit amount. Additionally, claims will be back-dated to reflect the date in which a claimant was laid-off or let go from their job due to COVID-19. The eligibility window to apply has also been increased from 14 to 28 days from the date of their work stoppage.
“We ask Michiganders to remain patient when filing for unemployment and to please follow this schedule to make it easier for everyone to access the emergency relief they need,” said UIA Director Steve Gray. “We’re recommending that workers go first to our 24-hr online system at Michigan.gov/UIA. We urge workers to only use our phone system if they do not have access to a computer or the internet.”

To help carry out Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s "Stay Home, Stay Safe" Executive Order and further protect public health and safety, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources is closing many amenities offered in state parks and recreation areas, effective now through at least April 13.
  State parks and recreation areas currently remain open to provide residents with local opportunities to get outdoors; however, extensive travel should be minimal – and reserved only for essential needs – and effective social distancing (of at least 6 feet between yourself and another person) is required so that unsafe conditions do not develop and state-managed lands can remain open.
  “We are doing everything possible to protect the health and safety of visitors and staff at state parks and recreation areas,” said DNR Director Dan Eichinger. “No matter how people are choosing to get outdoors, it is critical that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. If they don’t, we will be forced to close public access to all state-managed lands.”
Many park amenities have been closed in order to minimize the chance of people gathering in groups and/or maximize the environment for effective social distancing. Current closures include, but are not limited to, concessions, playgrounds and play equipment, viewing platforms, fishing piers, GaGa ball bits, volleyball and basketball courts, designated dog areas, disc golf courses, radio-controlled flying fields, pump tracks, and picnic tables and shelters.
  No hand washing stations will be provided. Please carry hand sanitizer or sanitizing wipes containing at least 60% alcohol, as well as trash bags to carry out used wipes.  
  Follow the DNR’s COVID-19 response webpage for the latest closure information related to events, meetings and facilities, including campgrounds, harbors and other sites.
  Executive order mandates social distancing; fines/penalties possible
  To help uphold the "Stay Home, Stay Safe" Executive Order, individuals must maintain a minimum of 6 feet between themselves and other people. Anyone not following the social distancing requirement may face misdemeanor violation/arrest penalties, including up to 90 days in jail and/or a fine up to $500.
  Social distancing practices are a top priority for any time spent outside an individual’s home or place of residence. They include:
Go out only if you’re feeling healthy.
Wash hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If those aren’t available, use a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

  The state’s COVID-19 website also has information on the Governor’s executive orders, directives and FAQs which allows for review of each order and its own frequently asked questions (FAQs). 
  “We are all in this together. If you can work from home, please do so,” Nessel said. “If you are a business and the Governor’s order requires you to reduce your onsite operations or temporarily suspend your onsite operations, please do that. For those who must work, please follow social distancing guidelines.”

The State of Michigan is working with utility companies to ensure protections are in place for customers as efforts to help slow the spread of the coronavirus impact families and businesses across the state.
  Major utilities including the state’s two largest, DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, have enacted moratoriums on service disconnections, and are extending flexible payment plans, for low-income customers, seniors and those impacted by illness or job losses related to the pandemic. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s Stay Home, Stay Safe executive order directs Michiganders to stay in their homes except for approved reasons such as critical infrastructure jobs or performing tasks necessary for health and safety, at least through April 13, 2020.
  “Michiganders are tough, and we will get through this emergency by helping one another,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said. “We are fortunate that utilities across Michigan have stepped up with proactive policies to assist those in need during this crisis.”
  Robert Gordon, Director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said maintaining electric and heating service is critical in the battle to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. “Michiganders need to stay home, and many are dealing with lost income,” Gordon said. “We must do everything we can to keep people safe at home while we work to reduce the impact of the coronavirus, and we appreciate our partners at energy utilities throughout the state who are stepping up to pause service disconnections and provide flexibility to customers in need.”
Funds also are available through partnering organizations to help eligible customers who are behind on their utility bills. In an effort to serve Michigan families struggling with energy costs related to COVID-19 as effectively as possible, the Department of Health and Human Services will take a number of actions to streamline the application process for its primary energy assistance program, State Emergency Relief.
“We encourage anyone who anticipates difficulty paying their energy bills not to wait, and to reach out to their utility company as soon as they can to work out payment options,” said Sally Talberg, Chairman of the Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates investor-owned energy companies in Michigan. “Each utility may vary, but whether you a have medical or financial need, payment protections and assistance are available.”
State Emergency Relief (SER) may help low-income households pay part of their heating or electric bills, assist in keeping utilities in service, or have service restored. The program is available year-round. Call your local Department of Health and Human Services office for information or apply on MI Bridges. Households must apply for SER assistance prior to receiving any Michigan Energy Assistance Program services.
  Under Gov. Whitmer’s stay-home order, utility workers are considered essential as they work to keep Michigan’s energy infrastructure safe and reliable. Their health is critical to maintaining energy service.
Please practice social distancing and do not approach workers if you see them outside. If a utility worker comes to your home on a service call, please maintain a minimum of six feet of distance from them.
If you experience a power outage or an emergency such as a wire down, contact your utility as you normally would.
  Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of:
  The best prevention for viruses, such as influenza, the common cold or COVID-19, is to:
If you think you have symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider. If you do not have a health care provider, call the nearest hospital.   Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If not available, use hand sanitizer.

  “The state has never experienced an emergency of this magnitude that simultaneously increases the need for services while lessening the ability for personal connections,” said State Chief Information Officer and Acting DTMB Director Brom Stibitz. “We are asking for patience in the face of this unprecedented crisis while we are working around the clock to make it easier to complete online transactions.”
  MILogin is the single-sign-on portal to access critical state services that have seen a sharp increase in transactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping social distance and complying with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order to stay home and stay safe, Michigan residents have turned to online options to renew driver’s licenses, apply for unemployment benefits, receive food assistance, and much more at a higher volume than ever before.

Michigan’s small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 virus can now apply for grants and loans through the Michigan Small Business Relief Program, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation announced today. The program will provide up to $20 million in grants and loans to provide economic assistance to Michigan’s small businesses that have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus, and in turn help support workers and their families facing economic uncertainty during the outbreak. Information on how to apply, as well as eligibility criteria, is available at www.michiganbusiness.org/covid19.
“Small businesses across our state are facing unprecedented challenges as we take every step possible to mitigate the spread of coronavirus,” said Governor Gretchen Whitmer. “With this funding, we can provide real assistance to support our businesses, communities, entrepreneurs and workers around the state impacted by the tough, but necessary actions we are taking to mitigate the spread of this virus.”
“We know small businesses across the state are struggling right now, and we are leveraging every resource available to provide relief in the face of these challenging economic circumstances,” said MEDC CEO Mark A. Burton. “The Michigan Small Business Relief Program will provide immediate assistance to support the health and sustainability of the state’s small businesses, communities and residents.”
In addition to the Michigan Small Business Relief Program, michiganbusiness.org/covid19 also features other resources for businesses across Michigan to assist them in recovering from economic losses as a result of the COVID-19 virus. This includes U.S. Small Business Administration emergency loans, the Pure Michigan Business Connect virtual procurement and donation platform, support services offered through the SBDC and more. The MEDC has also developed a FAQ for Michigan businesses and communities at michiganbusiness.org/covid19-faq.
Information around this outbreak is changing rapidly. The latest information is available at Michigan.gov/Coronavirus and CDC.gov/Coronavirus.

To combat the spread of COVID-19 in Michigan, Governor Whitmer signed the “Stay Home, Stay Safe” executive order. For at least the next three weeks, all Michigan businesses and operations must temporarily suspend in-person operations that are not necessary to sustain or protect life, and all Michiganders must stay in their homes unless they’re a part of that critical infrastructure workforce, engaged in an outdoor activity, or performing tasks necessary to the health and safety of themselves or their family, like going to the hospital or grocery store.
Go to the hospital or secure any care necessary to address a medical emergency or to preserve your health or the health of a loved one.
Walk your pets and take them to the veterinarian for needed medical care.
Visit someone in the hospital, nursing home, or other residential care facilities (with limited exceptions).

Governor directs all non-critical businesses to temporarily close, all Michiganders to stay home or six feet away from others during COVID-19 crisis 
LANSING, Mich. -- Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed the “Stay Home, Stay Safe” Executive Order (EO 2020-21), directing all Michigan businesses and operations to temporarily suspend in-person operations that are not necessary to sustain or protect life. The order also directs Michiganders to stay in their homes unless they’re a part of that critical infrastructure workforce, engaged in an outdoor activity, or performing tasks necessary to the health and safety of themselves or their family, like going to the hospital or grocery store.  
Effective at 12:01 am on March 24, 2020, for at least the next three weeks, individuals may only leave their home or place of residence under very limited circumstances, and they must adhere to social distancing measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when they do so, including remaining at least six feet from people from outside the individual’s household to the extent feasible under the circumstances. 
“In just 13 days, we’ve gone from 0 to over 1,000 COVID-19 cases,” said Governor Whitmer. “This is an unprecedented crisis that requires all of us working together to protect our families and our communities. The most effective way we can slow down the virus is to stay home. I know this will be hard, but it will be temporary. If we all come together, get serious, and do our part by staying home, we can stay safe and save lives.” 
“Taking aggressive action to protect our communities is the most important thing we can do to mitigate further spread of COVID-19,” said Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Chief Deputy for Health and Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun. “If we do this now, we can make sure our hospitals and healthcare workers are prepared to take care of the sickest people. It is crucial that people do the right thing by staying home and staying safe.” 
Executive Order 2020-21 prohibits all businesses and operations from requiring workers to leave their homes, unless those workers are necessary to sustain or protect life or to conduct minimum basic operations. Businesses and operations are to designate the workers that meet those criteria, and must adopt social distancing practices and other mitigation measures to protect workers and patrons in the performance of that necessary in-person work. 
Workers that are necessary to sustain or protect life include those in health care and public health, law enforcement and public safety, grocery store workers, and more. For a full list of these critical infrastructure workers, click the link to Executive Order 2020-21 at the bottom of this page. 
Michigan is currently in the top five states in the nation in number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Several governors across the country have taken similar steps to protect their communities from the spread of COVID-19, including governors Mike DeWine (R-OH), Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), J.B. Pritzker (D-IL), Tom Wolf (D-PA), Gavin Newsom (D-CA), John Bel Edwards (D-LA), Phil Murphy (D-NJ), and Ned Lamont (D-CT). 
Patients with confirmed infection have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of:    
The best prevention for viruses, such as influenza, the common cold or COVID-19 is:  
If you think you have symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider. If you do not have a health care provider, call the nearest hospital.       
Information around this outbreak is changing rapidly. The latest information is available at Michigan.gov/Coronavirus and CDC.gov/Coronavirus.    
For those who have questions about the state’s actions to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, please call the COVID-19 Hotline at 1-888-535-6136 between 8AM - 5PM daily.   
Michiganders can apply for unemployment benefits if they have left work or taken a leave of absence because of self-isolation or self-quarantine in response to elevated risk from COVID-19 due to being immunocompromised, displaying the symptoms of COVID-19, having contact in the last 14 days with someone with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, the need to care for someone with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, or a family care responsibility as a result of a government directive. Those temporarily laid off from work should apply for unemployment benefits online at www.michigan.gov/UIA or 1-866-500-0017.

Widespread ongoing transmission of a respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (COVID-19) is occurring globally. During the COVID-19 pandemic you may be exposed to the virus while traveling—from sick persons at airports, or on airplanes, ships, trains, or buses. Some health care systems are becoming overwhelmed and there may be limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas. Many countries are implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice. Airlines have cancelled many international flights and in-country travel may be unpredictable. If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may have to remain outside the United States for an indefinite length of time.
Illness with COVID-19 has ranged from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms of infection include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. This new coronavirus has caused severe disease and death in patients who developed pneumonia. Risk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Stay home, monitor your health, and practice social distancing for 14 days after you return from travel. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.

Global COVID-19 Pandemic Notice
Widespread ongoing transmission of a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is occurring globally.
Older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions are at increased risk for severe disease.
There may be limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.
Travelers should avoid contact with sick people and wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
All international travelers should stay home for 14 days after returning from travel, monitor their health, and practice social distancing.
The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19. In countries where commercial travel options remain available, U.S. citizens should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite length of time. For more information, visit the Department of State website.
Widespread ongoing transmission of a respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (COVID-19) is occurring globally. During the COVID-19 pandemic you may be exposed to the virus while traveling—from sick persons at airports, or on airplanes, ships, trains, or buses. Some health care systems are becoming overwhelmed and there may be limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas. Many countries are implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice. Airlines have cancelled many international flights and in-country travel may be unpredictable. If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may have to remain outside the United States for an indefinite length of time.
Illness with COVID-19 has ranged from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms of infection include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. This new coronavirus has caused severe disease and death in patients who developed pneumonia. Risk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Stay home, monitor your health, and practice social distancing for 14 days after you return from travel. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.
Healthcare providers should obtain a detailed travel history for patients with fever or acute respiratory symptoms. If a traveler is suspected to have COVID-19, see Information for Healthcare Professionals for information on evaluating, reporting, clinical care guidance, and infection control.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Issues Temporary Policy for FSMA Onsite Audit Requirements
Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took steps to help prevent disruptions in the food supply-chain by issuing a temporary policy for FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) supplier verification onsite audit requirements during the coronavirus (COVID-19) public health emergency.
“While our grocery stores are facing unprecedented demand, we are working with industry to minimize disruptions in the supply-chain due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “The policy released today will help to minimize disruptions so that the food industry can meet the demand while also continuing to conduct supplier verification activities that are designed to ensure food safety and following government travel restrictions and advisories. While we are confident that stores will remain open and supply will continue to meet demand nationwide, we ask all Americans to only purchase enough food and essentials for the week ahead.”
However, the travel restrictions and advisories associated with the novel coronavirus may make some audits temporarily impractical to conduct. Therefore, the policy announced today states that the agency will temporarily not enforce FSMA supplier verification onsite audit requirements if other appropriate supplier verification methods are used instead. Other supplier verification methods, such as sampling and testing or a review of food safety records, would be designed to provide sufficient assurance that hazards have been significantly minimized or prevented during the period of onsite audit delay. 
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

Boeing to Temporarily Suspend Puget Sound Production Operations in Response to Escalating COVID-19 Pandemic
CHICAGO, March 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing [NYSE: BA] announced a temporary suspension of production operations at its Puget Sound area facilities in light of the state of emergency in Washington state and the company's continuous assessment of the accelerating spread of the coronavirus in the region. These actions are being taken to ensure the well-being of employees, their families and the local community, and will include an orderly shutdown consistent with the requirements of its customers.
Boeing plans to begin reducing production activity today and projects the suspension of such operations to begin on Wednesday, March 25, at sites across the Puget Sound area. The suspension of production operations will last 14 days, during which Boeing will continue to monitor government guidance and actions on COVID-19 and its associated impacts on all company operations. During this time, we will be conducting additional deep cleaning activities at impacted sites and establishing rigorous criteria for return to work.
"This necessary step protects our employees and the communities where they work and live," said Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun. "We continue to work closely with public health officials, and we're in contact with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders who are affected by this temporary suspension. We regret the difficulty this will cause them, as well as our employees, but it's vital to maintain health and safety for all those who support our products and services, and to assist in the national effort to combat the spread of COVID-19," Calhoun added.
Puget Sound area-based employees who can work from home will continue to do so. Those who cannot work remotely will receive paid leave for the initial 10 working days of the suspension – double the company policy – which will provide coverage for the 14 calendar day suspension period.

COVID-19 Is Crushing Small Business: Can Banks Move Fast Enough?
Small businesses across America are the economic ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic. The cash-flow squeeze resulting from a partial or complete halt in their business operations could spell bankruptcy quickly for many. Banks and credit unions can help avert that scenario, if they act quickly. Here's what some are doing now.
On Main Streets and in strip malls across America, signs are taped on doors and windows: “Closed due to coronavirus”; or “Take-out only.”
Gyms, restaurants, barbershops, nail salons, non-food retailers, and countless other small businesses, including small contractors, have all been forced to close to support social distancing rules being implemented in numerous states and around the world. There are 30 million small businesses in the U.S. alone, according to the SBA. Even if just 10% of them were forced to halt operations due the pandemic, that’s three million businesses.
At the federal and state levels, policymakers are pulling all the levers to stave off an economic deep freeze. In addition to a massive federal financial aid package — which could include $350 billion in help for small business — the federal and state banking regulators, in a joint statement, urged financial institutions to work with customers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. If done in a safe and sound manner, the statement said, the agencies “will not criticize institutions … and will not direct supervised institutions to automatically categorize loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings.”
Loan Payment Deferral. If your small business is facing a financial hardship due to COVID-19, contact Associated Bank. We will make available payment deferrals for up to 90 days, with no credit bureau impact.
In addition to remedies similar to those above, Bank of America is allowing small business clients to request refunds on various fees including overdraft, late fees and monthly maintenance fees. The giant bank, like many institutions, notes on its website that it works on a case by case basis for these requests, as it has in other situations such as the government shutdown in early 2019 and during natural disasters. The scope of the COVID-19 crisis, however, could strain such a plan, especially for the larger institutions with millions of small business customers.

  Many institutions are promising to help customers obtain an SBA 7(a) loan. Pennsylvania-based Customers Bank, for example, is notifying small business clients of SBA’s emergency loan program as well as traditional SBA financing options. “We want businesses throughout the community to know we are available to help them navigate the complexities of the SBA loan process,” states Richard Ehst, President and CEO. Ehst also said the bank has committed to provide $200 million in new small business lending to qualifying companies.
Another example is Seattle-based WaFd Bank (Washington Federal Bank, NA), which announced a revolving 5-year business line of credit up to $200,000 with the first 90 days interest free available to businesses impacted by COVID-19. Describing the line as “emergency funding,” the bank says any company with a 10% or greater drop in revenue can apply. It also says it will expedite the approval process for lines up to $30,000.
“We understand that small businesses may need an emergency business loan due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and we are doing our best to help out small businesses during this uncertain time,” the bank says on its website.

Why vitamin C won't 'boost' your immune system against the coronavirus
Health
Health & Wellness
True, but these studies were done in healthy young volunteers. The LPI recommendations, for example, are to maintain health - not treat disease (how do I know this? I helped write them!). We don't know what happens in people who are sick. While not the most reliable source, Robert Cathcart did show a very unusual phenomenon of increased bowel tolerance for vitamin C during illness. To my knowledge, this has never been adequately followed up in clinical trials.
2) IV administration of vitamin C bypasses this restriction and allows higher doses of the nutrient to be sustained in the blood. Historically, researchers have proposed that vitamin C supplementation, in general, could be used to treat pneumonia because the condition is a common complication of scurvy, which results from vitamin C deficiency. Since then there have been anecdotal accounts, case studies, and preliminary clincal trials attempting to use IV vitamin C to treat pneumonia, with mixed or ineffective results (see here). In other cases, when vitamin C appeared to help somewhat, I've seen that the treatment is sometimes combined with other interventions, so it's difficult to discern the effect of vitamin C in isolation (see here).
3) In the context of this study, shared by @vedhogger, the IV vitamin C they're describing as "high-dose" is only a 50-200mg dose, which seems in line with standard vitamin C supplementation. In addition, they are recommending that course of treatment when treating patients with mild or no symptoms (assuming my Chinese to English translator is accurate). In other words, in this context, it seems as though the treatment team is ensuring that patients receive enough vitamin C to maintain normal immune function.
However, on this point I do agree with you: a recommendation by a medical association does not mean the treatment is working. YouTube videos do not count as evidence, nor do "press releases" by the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service
If SARS is also from the coronavirus family and more virulent than COVID19, it stands to reason that a therapeutic dose of vitamin c would also have some effectiveness against viral pneumonia stemming from COVID19.
Vitamin C and SARS coronavirus
If SARS is also from the coronavirus family and more virulent than COVID19, it stands to reason that a therapeutic dose of vitamin c would also have some effectiveness against viral pneumonia stemming from COVID19.
'There is also evidence indicating that vitamin C may affect pneumonia.3 In particular, three controlled trials with human subjects reported a significantly lower incidence of pneumonia in vitamin C-supplemented groups,6 suggesting that vitamin C may affect susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infections under certain conditions. The possibility that vitamin C affects severe viral respiratory tract infections would seem to warrant further study, especially in light of the recent SARS epidemic'
I did indeed. And nowhere in that small letter (not a clinical trial) did Dr. Hemila suggest that vitamin C does kill coronavirus or suggest how it should be used.
I did indeed. And nowhere in that small letter (not a clinical trial) did Dr. Hemila suggest that vitamin C does kill coronavirus or suggest how it should be used.
But you're right. It does warrant further study, hence, it's important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and simply assume that 'vitamin c can't/won't boost ones immunity against the corona virus'.
Vitamin C is not harmful when taken. There's no question that it's a vitally important part of living as a healthy human. If you take vitamin C supplements, we're not trying to stop you.
However, there is currently no thoroughly vetted clinical testing to say that vitamin C alone will stop anyone from getting, spreading, or growing ill from the coronavirus.
To take it in the doses required for the kind of extra added protection people hope for, they need to get it intravenously. This means that most people looking to pursue this option would need to have it administered by a medical professional in a hospital or doctor's office, which is not an ideal situation during a pandemic where social distancing is needed to slow the spread.
I don't buy in to the author's initial title by any means. Just using that language implies some uselessness in vitamin C supplementation. I guess it gets more clicks than "We really wish we knew what was going on with vitamin C and COVID-19"

Personally I have found that taking very small doses often mitigates any unwanted side effects of an upset stomach and I have warded off many viruses this way.
All I'm suggesting is that others do their own research and be proactive about their own health choices.
But you're right. It does warrant further study, hence, it's important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and simply assume that 'vitamin c can't/won't boost ones immunity against the corona virus'.
It's also no theory that pandemics keep the CDC, WHO etc in business, so it's not conspiracy to suggest that they're unlikely to fund such a study either.
And in the absence of evidence to debunk them, I ask, what is the harm in doing one's own research and being proactive about our own health choices?
To even loosely suggest that vitamin C won't/is incapable of boosting one's immunity is completely misleading.
I will gladly agree with EternalFlame79 on personal health (and lack of funding). Will vitamin C help you? I don't know - try it out. We all need to balance risk vs. reward. But understand that making definite statements for everyone is not within the power of the science at the moment.

Now, if your claim is that vitamin C will literally cure every potential illness, then I could see making the leap to saying that studying vitamin C would hurt the money in medicine. My assumption is that you're not making that claim. So, if vitamin C just helps reduce symptoms of some illnesses, then these oganizations would substantially benefit from being the first one to prove as much.
They could then spend time and effort stopping the many, many, many illnesses that remain, all while preventing all the negative repercussions of our current global pandemic.
This article does not suggest that vitamin C is "of no use." Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that supports the body's ability to combat invasive pathogens, in general, and this includes COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that taking vitamin C supplements - in any dose or form of administration - can completely prevent you from catching COVID-19.
In terms of treating COVID-19 with high-dose vitamin C, there is at least one ongoing clinical trial testing that application, which I cite in the article. But again, these are highly preliminary studies, and they are mostly based on the compiled research about vitamin C and the common cold. The commenters are correct in that some studies have explored the use of high-dose vitamin C for pneumonia, a possible complication of COVID-19, but the results have been mixed and the studies limited.
Here is a link to a study using IV VIT C as the treatment for coronavirus. In China. Also used for sepsis in emergency rooms. Check it out.

This paper is a Medical Hyphosis based on his treatments of "over 9000 patients", but you can find the Clinical Studies supporting it in the Refrence section of the paper.
What's more, if you notice on the main orthomolecular.org website, if you click "Contribute," the link will lead you to a website called the Riordan Clinic where you can buy supplements and lab tests of varying sorts. That in and of itself should raise your suspicions as to whether these articles are disseminating the best scientific information available, or are primarily aimed at trying to sell you something.
"Vitamin C is extremely unlikely to help people fight off the new coronavirus."
"It is well established that certain symptoms are associated with an almost total lack of vitamin C within the body. Symptoms of scurvy include lassitude, malaise, bleeding gums, loss of teeth, nosebleeds, bruising, hemorrhages in any part of the body, easy infections, poor healing of wounds, deterioration of joints, brittle and painful bones, and death, etc."

2) That if one does get ill, that increasing this amount until one reaches bowel tolerance can help diminish the symptoms and speed healing.
"Vitamin C is extremely unlikely to help people fight off the new coronavirus."
That's a proven lie. It is proven that someone with scurvy is MORE susceptible to all illnesses (including the coronavirus).
True, but these studies were done in healthy young volunteers. The LPI recommendations, for example, are to maintain health - not treat disease (how do I know this? I helped write them!).

The Lancet article was specifically about people who had pneumonia and not everyone who had the 2019 novel coronavirus. So, yes, 75% had double pneumonia and the other 25% had single pneumonia.
"In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia."
Did you read The Lancet article? You are spreading misinformation. 75% of the patients had bilateral pneumonia. This virus is not comparable to the flu.
You realize this study was conducted on hospitalized patients, right? What percentage of hospitalized flu patients do you think have complications like pneumonia, sepsis, shock, etc? I'm a physician who takes care of hospitalized patients, including many flu patients, every year and the answer is pretty much all of them--otherwise they wouldn't have been admitted to the hospital.
With that said, current data does suggest that this nCoV-19 is more infectious and far deadlier than the flu. However, current data is limited in many ways and both its infectivity and especially its mortality rate is likely to drop significantly with more data.

However, current data is limited in many ways and both its infectivity and especially its mortality rate is likely to drop significantly with more data.
I'm curious as to why more data becoming available could have an impact on the mortality rate? Thanks!

The flu spreads every year from many points of existing infection. It never dies out. It just changes its dominant hemisphere. Covid-19 started from a single point in China this year, so it was at a transmission disadvantage compared to the flu. That explains how the R0 for covid-19 can be higher than the flu even though covid-19 has fewer cases this year than the flu.
I'm curious as to why more data becoming available could have an impact on the mortality rate? Thanks!
Because most of the data has been gathered at hospitals where the most serious cases end up. It stands to reason that deaths would be overrepresented in that setting. I think the best data to watch is the mortality rate from those infected on the cruise ship since that was a closed system. I believe there are 3 deaths out of 700 so far, but the infection is still spreading and it's too early to draw any conclusions from that. We should know more in a month or so after the virus has run its course completely on that subgroup.
From what I'm reading, hearing, from medical officials, Washington, China, and other countries,World Health Organization, and I am objective, I don't call it a flu" but a virus that' s to be taken very serious. Think of others to be of service . Time to come together, fight this thing.
Most articles are trying to compare the Flu in America to the COVID-19 in China as numbers.
They didn't include any statistics on the Flu in China to compare to the COVID-19.
Here is something even worse, it's best to use data from when the Flu first appeared compared to when COVID-19 appeared. The reason for this is because we have better ways at combating the Flu compared to the COVID-19 since it's a new virus.
Based on statistics, a total of 87,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported but only about 3,000 have resulted in a death where 42,000 have already recovered from it.
The Flu of 2009 which lasted a little more of a year claimed a lot more lives, the Flu of 2009 killed well over 200,000+ people and infected well over 700 million people, again the main cause of death was the respiratory.
Health Corporations like to cause panic in order for vaccines and treatments to be sold so they could get a profit, this was seen during the Flu of 2009 in which corporations pressured WHO (World Health Organization) in order for corporations to make profits.

My question is, is there an incubation period for COVID-19? My impression is that it’s contagious for 14 days prior to one showing symptoms — Is this true, and is a true for all cases? That would make it very hard to stop an pandemic. From what I read SARS was contaned because it wasn’t contagious until one showed symptoms of it. So they were able to quarantine the one with SARS immediately and eventually track down everyone who had it. If you can’t tell who have corona virus and you can’t test of everyone, it seems very difficult to stop it.
It's more deadly and more contagious than seasonal flu, and nothing can stop it. We're all going to get it, or its vaccine. Everything you read is just your government telling you that you're outta luck.
Comparing the flu to the new coronavirus is like comparing apples and oranges.
Most articles are trying to compare the Flu in America to the COVID-19 in China as numbers.
They didn't include any statistics on the Flu in China to compare to the COVID-19.
Here is something even worse, it's best to use data from when the Flu first appeared compared to when COVID-19 appeared. The reason for this is because we have better ways at combating the Flu compared to the COVID-19 since it's a new virus.
Based on statistics, a total of 87,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported but only about 3,000 have resulted in a death where 42,000 have already recovered from it.
The Flu of 2009 which lasted a little more of a year claimed a lot more lives, the Flu of 2009 killed well over 200,000+ people and infected well over 700 million people, again the main cause of death was the respiratory.
Health Corporations like to cause panic in order for vaccines and treatments to be sold so they could get a profit, this was seen during the Flu of 2009 in which corporations pressured WHO (World Health Organization) in order for corporations to make profits.
Medical professionals (certain) give credence to the virus leading to (Disease) of the lungs, Meaning if you have the virus and test negative after treatment or after fighting to recoup and you do. A person (may develope lung disease) . Even after the virus, related to the virus directly. No! Only certain individuals like myself, older, heart disease, health conditions, respiratory and immune problems. But I do believe Israel doctors say they will have a vaccine, Until then be kind to others, help if you can, be of service, ask questions, pray, and be more than you are, We all hope warm weather will affect the virus to kill it someway. But we are all affected by it in ways together. Be positive.
I was wondering if anyone has heard of the third component of the Novel Corona-virus
(COVID-19)? The main component seems to be the corona strain prevalent in Wuhan China, because of its preference for Asian males. The second component seems to a HIV strain from the CDC, but what is the third component.?
Comparing a naturally occurring virus strain and a manufactured virus strain is indeed comparing apples and oranges, until we look at the infection and mortality rates over a set time period.
I would think a vaccine would be hard since common colds are also, often, caused by a type of coronavirus and I don't believe they have a vaccine for the common cold yet.

New York Officials Tell U.N. Coronavirus Has Spread Throughout City

New York City officials advised the U.N. diplomatic community on Saturday that the new coronavirus has spread widely through the city and could potentially linger as a threat to the health of residents until as late as September, according to four diplomatic sources.
“Everyone in New York should assume that they have been in contact with COVID-19,” city officials told the foreign delegates, according to a readout of a conference call with New York-based diplomats, which was reviewed by Foreign Policy.
The briefers—who were led by Penny Abeywardena, New York City commissioner in the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, and included officials from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, outlined a series of “best practices” to help foreign delegations get through the crisis, according to the account. But they offered no assurance that the city would provide special services to foreign diplomats exposed to the virus in New York, including tests, according to the account.
The readout did not directly quote the briefers, who included Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy commissioner in the health department’s Division of Disease Control, and Maura Kennelly, the acting associate commissioner for external affairs at the health department. It presented an overview of the meeting in the form of paraphrased questions from the diplomats and answers from city officials.
[Mapping the Coronavirus Outbreak: Get daily updates on the pandemic and learn how it’s affecting countries around the world.]
The briefing to the diplomatic community came on a day when the number of confirmed cases of infections in New York state rose to 613, including 269 in New York City. They included a 65-year-old man from Rockland County and an 82-year-old Brooklyn woman, who were declared the state’s first coronavirus fatalities, and two New York State Assembly members, Helene Weinstein, 67, and Charles Barron, 69. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, meanwhile, announced the administration was moving forward with plans to “offer telecommuting or a staggered work schedule for about 100,000 city employees,” the New York Times reported. De Blasio, however, has resisted calls for shutting down the city public school system, the largest in the country.
During the Saturday afternoon briefing, New York City medical officials emphasized that New York is “in the mitigation phase of the outbreak,” according to the readout. “This means that all individuals should assume that they have had some contact with the virus and practice the maximum-possible social distancing; most cases will be mild and medical care should only be sought in urgent, worsening, or vulnerable cases.”
A new podcast from Foreign Policy covering all aspects of the coronavirus pandemic
The briefers characterized the most vulnerable as the elderly, particularly those over 70 years of age, and individuals over the age of 50 with underlying health conditions, according to the account.
“Testing should be reserved for the sickest (hospitalized) patients,” the account said.
The New York City officials said that the city has changed its strategy from the early days when the virus arrived in New York, when health authorities sought to track and contain small numbers of cases. “Testing is now less important—the danger of transmission is much higher as many people have now been exposed and the majority of people will only have mild symptoms,” according to the readout.

The Coronavirus Pandemic Tells a Tale of 3 Leaders
The city’s strategy appeared inconsistent with the advice of the World Health Organization, which has urged governments to combine containment policies, such as contact tracing, with mitigation policies aimed at preventing the transmission of the virus through so-called social distancing and the prohibition of large public gatherings.
Those who exhibit symptoms associated with coronavirus—fever, dry coughs, difficulty breathing—should isolate themselves from others.
The sick should only seek a doctor’s advice if symptoms are rapidly worsening or they experience shortness of breath. Any doctor’s office, they added, has the authority to order a test if needed, according to the account.
The ill should avoid seeking emergency care “except if advised by a doctor, and if co-morbidities are present such as cancer, elderly, etc.,” according to the first account. They said that the Department of Health is no longer asking for information about infections unless they are part of a “suspected high-risk cluster.”
“Interviews with confirmed cases and contact tracing is not a good use of our resources when the virus is widespread,” according to the readout. “There will be little emphasis on tracing.”
The city’s health officials said that those infected with coronavirus remain infectious for about 72 hours after their initial fever abates, but they should remain in isolation for an additional seven days after the symptoms subside. “We are hopeful that exposure to COVID will make people immune, but too early to say definitively,” according to the account.
Diplomats said they welcome the city’s candor in describing the crisis. But they expressed some concern about the city’s commitment to address all their needs. For instance, the delegations would be responsible for disinfecting their own missions in the event of an outbreak, noting that the city lacked sufficient supplies for them.
New York officials also said that it was unlikely they would notify foreign delegations if one of their nationals tested positive, citing the importance of maintaining patient privacy. The officials said they were unable to guarantee the city would be able to observe delegations’ diplomatic immunity to travel in restricted areas, saying they “would have to balance immunities with the needs of the community.”
One senior diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the briefing was confidential, said the basic takeaway was: “It’s your responsibility not to get infected, and your responsibility to stay home if you do. Your odds of not dying are rather great—if you get close, ‘Give us a call.’”
Correction, March 15, 2020: A previous version of this story incorrectly attributed a readout of a New York City briefing on the coronavirus to the New York City Mayor’s Office for International Affairs. The readout was written by a representative of a foreign mission in New York and circulated widely in the U.N. diplomatic community.

If a presidential nominee gets coronavirus, we’re in uncharted territory
Here’s how the presidential nomination process could change if a nominee got coronavirus.

As the nation is trying to get through the coronavirus pandemic, America is also trying to get through a presidential election.
The crisis has already affected the election in tangible ways, with states pushing back their primary contests and all remaining campaigns putting a hiatus on in-person campaign rallies. Furthermore, President Donald Trump and the two remaining contenders for the Democratic nomination — former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders — are all in their 70s and at higher risk for more severe Covid-19 symptoms.
Biden is working and social distancing at his home in Delaware, where he’s been holding press conferences and virtual campaign events from his recreation room. Trump and Sanders, who have each been working in the White House and Senate, could be more at risk simply because they’re coming into contact with more people each day.
To be clear, recovery is possible at any age, and thus far, all three men appear to be healthy. But what if they weren’t?
Many are wondering what would happen if the presumptive nominee of either party got sick with Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and became physically unable to accept the nomination before the party’s conventions this summer. Or, more worrisome, what would happen if a party nominee were to die before the general election?
Presidents have died shortly after taking office (William Henry Harrison died six weeks after assuming the presidency in 1841, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt died a few months into his fourth term). But a death before a candidate accepts the nomination or gets inaugurated is uncharted territory in American politics.
A lot would depend on when in the nomination process a candidate became ill, experts say. For instance, if a presumptive nominee died before the respective party convention took place, a party — through its delegates — can select a new one. But if a death or vacancy occurred after a convention, party leaders would play an even bigger role in deciding the replacement.
Here’s what we know about how the nomination process could change if either the Democratic or Republican nominee got Covid-19.
There are multiple scenarios around how a new presidential nominee could be selected in the case of severe illness or even death. It depends on how far along in the nomination process we are, according to New York University law professor Rick Pildes, an expert on constitutional and electoral law.
A presumptive nominee or nominee is sick but not dying: Pildes pointed out that a nominee does not have to be physically present in order to accept a nomination. So considering our current situation with coronavirus, if either Trump or Biden were hospitalized with a non-life-threatening case of coronavirus, they could accept the nomination in writing or with a phone call.
Filling a Vacancy on the National Ticket: In the event of death, resignation or disability of a nominee of the Party for President or Vice President after the adjournment of the National Convention, the National Chairperson of the Democratic National Committee shall confer with the Democratic leadership of the United States Congress and the Democratic Governors Association and shall report to the Democratic National Committee, which is authorized to fill the vacancy or vacancies.
The rest of the primary calendar is more uncertain due to the coronavirus
But we also don’t know when exactly he is going to hit that threshold, because some states are postponing their elections due to the coronavirus outbreak. More than a dozen states and territories have pushed back their primary elections or moved to only mail-in voting to protect poll workers and voters. We don’t know yet what these delays will mean for the nominating process.
In the meantime, the Democratic National Committee is urging states to get their voting systems to be more resilient during a public health crisis. That means states are beefing up vote-by-mail systems to be more accommodating, protecting both voters and poll workers in the process.
In some states, like Wisconsin, the DNC is teaming up with the state party to sue to expand access to vote by mail and to easier forms of voting registration. And two Democratic senators have secured funding in the latest Senate coronavirus package to increase America’s vote-by-mail capacity.
If adopted on a more widespread basis, vote-by-mail could help Democrats decide their nominee while still following public health experts’ social distancing guidelines. But if states keep delaying their primaries and Sanders continues to stay in the race, it could allow more uncertainty about who will be the nominee.
That uncertainty would only increase if the presumptive nominee tested positive for the coronavirus.

How to protect yourself and others from coronavirus (COVID-19)
To help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect those who are most at risk, it is important that you take the recommended steps to protect yourself and others.
If you have COVID-19, wearing a surgical mask can help to prevent spreading it to others.
If you are well, you do not need to wear a surgical mask. There is little evidence that widespread use of surgical masks in healthy people prevents transmission in public.
To help slow the spread of COVID-19, practise good hygiene and social distancing and follow the rules for public gatherings and self-isolation.
Social distancing
Find out how to practise social distancing in public, at home, at work, and in schools.
Self-isolation
Self-isolation means staying at home for 14 days. Find out who must self-isolate and how to self-isolate.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but there is one for the flu.
You should get your flu shot when it’s available. Getting the flu and COVID-19 at the same time can make you very ill.
Scientists from around the world are working on developing a vaccine for COVID-19. The World Health Organisation believes this may be available within 18 months.

What you need to know about coronavirus (COVID-19)
COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a new virus. Symptoms include fever, coughing, sore throat and shortness of breath. The virus can spread from person to person, but good hygiene can prevent infection. Find out who is at risk and what you should do if you think you have COVID-19.

What is COVID-19
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections. These can range from the common cold to more serious diseases.
COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus. It was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City in China.
Other coronaviruses include Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
Symptoms
Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild illness to pneumonia. Some people will recover easily, and others may get very sick very quickly.
People with coronavirus may experience:
flu-like symptoms such as coughing, sore throat and fatigue
If you are concerned you may have COVID-19:

healthdirect Coronavirus (COVID-19) Symptom Checker
Answer questions about your symptoms to see if you need to seek medical help or get tested. This tool is available online at any time.
If you are not showing symptoms, you should still protect yourself and others.
The virus can spread from person to person through:
close contact with an infectious person (including in the 24 hours before they started showing symptoms)
contact with droplets from an infected person’s cough or sneeze
touching objects or surfaces (like doorknobs or tables) that have cough or sneeze droplets from an infected person, and then touching your mouth or face
COVID-19 is a new disease, so there is no existing immunity in our community. This means that COVID-19 could spread widely and quickly.
In Australia, the people most at risk of getting the virus are:
those who have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19
People who are more at risk of serious illness if they get the virus are:
people with compromised immune systems (eg. cancer)
people with chronic medical conditions
*At this stage the risk to children and babies, and the role children play in the transmission of COVID-19, is not clear. However, there has so far been a low rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases among children, relative to the broader population.
Everyone must do the following things to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect those who are most at risk.
social distancing
self-isolation
How to seek medical attention
If you are sick and think you have symptoms of COVID-19, seek medical advice. If you want to talk to someone about your symptoms, call the National Coronavirus Helpline for advice.

You must go straight home. Do not go to the shops, even to buy food, medicine or groceries. Organise for family or friends to buy supplies for your or order them online for delivery. If you need support contact your local state or territory health departments.
Monitoring symptoms
When in isolation, monitor yourself for symptoms.
Call your doctor for an urgent assessment if you develop symptoms within 14 days of:
your last contact with someone with COVID-19
See our home isolation guidance when unwell, which has advice on living arrangements at home while sick, wearing masks, cleaning, and more in several languages.
If you have difficulty breathing or become seriously unwell and it is an emergency, call triple zero (000) immediately and alert ambulance staff to your travel/contact history.
If you are well, others that live with you do not need to self-isolate unless they also meet one of the isolation criteria.
If you develop symptoms and health authorities suspect you have COVID-19, those living with you are close contacts and must isolate.
To minimise the spread of any germs regularly clean surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.
Managing isolation
Being in isolation for 14 days can be stressful and boring. To help manage being in isolation:
arrange to work from home
do things that help you relax and use isolation as an opportunity to do activities you don't usually have time for.
Visit Head to Health for links to trusted Australian mental health online and phone supports, resources and treatment options. This useful website also has online programs and forums, as well as a range of digital information resources.
Call the National Coronavirus Helpline on 1800 020 080. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If you require translating or interpreting services, call 131 450.
  Contact your local state and territory health departments.
Isolating at home if you are unwell or have coronavirus
If you have coronavirus or are unwell you may isolate at home if you:
do not live with household members who may be at increased risk of complications from novel coronavirus infection (a person over the age of 65, young children, pregnant women, people who are immunocompromised or who have chronic heart, lung, or kidney conditions).
Surfaces in shared areas such as door handles, taps and benches should be cleaned daily with household disinfectant or a diluted bleach solution
If you have difficulty breathing or are seriously unwell and it is an emergency, call triple zero (000) immediately.
If you have completed your 14 day self-isolation period without developing symptoms you may leave your home for essential activities such as shopping and work. If you can work from home, you should.
You must continue to practise social distancing and good hygiene to protect others in your community.
If you become unwell and experience coronavirus symptoms return home and contact your doctor.

Social distancing for coronavirus (COVID-19)
Everyone must practise social distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19.
One way to slow the spread of viruses is social distancing (also called physical distancing).
The more space between you and others, the harder it is for the virus to spread.
Social distancing in public means people:
Steps for social distancing in all homes include:
regularly disinfect surfaces that are touched a lot, such as tables, kitchen benches and doorknobs
If you can, work from home. If you cannot work from home and you are sick, you must not attend your workplace. You must stay at home and away from others.
Steps for social distancing in the workplace include:
provide alcohol based hand rub for all staff and workers
regularly clean and disinfect surfaces that many people touch
To reduce the spread of viruses or germs in schools:
regularly clean and disinfect surfaces that many people touch
You can still keep in touch with loved ones while you practise social distancing:

Limits on public gatherings for coronavirus (COVID-19)
Public gatherings significantly increase the risk of COVID-19 spreading. On 29 March the National Cabinet agreed to further limit most indoor and outdoor non-essential gathering to 2 people. Rules on essential gatherings are also in place. Find out what limits apply.
These limits help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. They are especially important for at risk people, such as older people and those with chronic conditions.
attending medical appointments or compassionate visits
This is especially important for people of the over age of 70, those over 60 years who have existing health concerns and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the aged of 50 who have existing health concerns.  These groups should limit the contact with others as much as possible when away from home.
spa and massage parlours, excluding health related services such as physiotherapy
health clubs, fitness centres, yoga, barre and spin facilities, saunas, bathhouses and wellness centres and swimming pools
Weddings can be conducted with no more than 5 people, including the couple, the celebrant and the witnesses. The 4 square metre rule and social distancing must be observed.
Funerals must be limited to no more than 10 people. The 4 square metre rule and social distancing must be observed.
Hairdressers and barbers can continue to operate under strict new rules. The 4 square metre rule and social distancing must be observed. 
The health advice on schools has not changed and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) does not recommend that schools be shut at this time. Some states may end their first term early.
If parents choose to keep their children home from schools that are open, they must be responsible for their children’s conduct and make sure they adhere to social distancing.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) current situation and case numbers
We are managing the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia as a health emergency. We will update this page every day with the current situation, latest case numbers and related information.
How we are managing the outbreak
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has announced that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
Currently, Australia does not have widespread community transmission of COVID-19. Find out how we are managing the outbreak to slow the spread.
As at 3:00pm on 29 March 2020, there have been 3,966 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia. There have been 331 new cases since 3:00pm yesterday.
Of the 3,966 confirmed cases in Australia, 16 have died from COVID-19. More than 211,000 tests have been conducted across Australia.
Confirmed cases*
* Note that under National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System reporting requirements, cases are reported based on their Australian jurisdiction of residence rather than where they were detected. For example, a case reported previously in the NT in a NSW resident is counted in the national figures as a NSW case.
** Includes Diamond Princess repatriation cases: Qld (3), SA (1), Vic (4), WA (2, including 1 death)
Data used in the overview are based on confirmed cases reported from jurisdictions to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) at 11.59pm 28 March 2020.
This graph shows the number of confirmed cases by notification date. Interpret the most recently reported new cases shown in the graph with caution as there can be delays in reporting.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) advice for older people
Everybody is at risk of contracting COVID-19 so you need to protect yourself and others. Older people over the age of 60, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people over the age of 50, are at greater risk of more serious illness with COVID-19.
Why is this virus so dangerous for older people?
Symptoms
Why is this virus so dangerous for older people?
The risk of serious illness from COVID-19 increases with age.
The highest rate of fatalities is among older people, particularly those with other serious health conditions or a weakened immune system.
There is currently no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, or immunity in the community.
Even if you are feeling well, it is important to take steps to prevent the spread of this virus.
Good hygiene and taking care when interacting with other people, are the best defences for you and your family against COVID-19. This includes:
using alcohol-based hand sanitisers, where available
cleaning and disinfecting surfaces you have touched
where possible, stay 1.5 metres away — 2 arms’ length — from other people. This is an example of social distancing
Symptoms
Symptoms include (but are not limited to) fever, coughing, a sore throat and difficulty breathing.
If you develop mild symptoms of COVID-19:
call a doctor and tell them about your symptoms and any contact with people with COVID-19
If you have serious symptoms such as difficulty breathing:
Call 000, ask for an ambulance and notify the officers if you have been in contact with anyone with COVID-19
If you have questions, you can call the National Coronavirus Helpline.
National Coronavirus Helpline
Call this line if you are seeking information on coronavirus (COVID-19). The line operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Contact your local state and territory health departments for information about your local health system arrangements. 
If you have concerns about your health, speak to your doctor.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) advice for people in aged care facilities
Everybody is at risk of contracting COVID-19 so you need to protect yourself and others. Managers, staff, family, friends and residents need to work together to protect older people in aged care facilities.
Preventing the spread of coronavirus
Like all members of the community, people who live in residential aged care services have an important role to play in protecting their own health.
In addition to practising good hygiene and social distancing, residential aged care facilities will  restrict visits.
If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you will be kept separate from other people and will not be able to see visitors.
Health care and residential care workers will continue to provide support and care for you while you are isolated.
If you need to leave your room, such as for medical care, you will be given a surgical mask. Health care workers will provide masks to you.
Visitors who have been in contact with someone confirmed to have COVID-19 in the last 14 days
Visitors with a fever or symptoms of a respiratory illness
From 1 May, you must have your influenza vaccination in order to visit an aged care facility.
This will limit your exposure to COVID-19 and your chances of accidentally spreading it to the other older people in your life.
The Australian Government has announced that residential aged care facilities should take extra precautions to keep residents safe from COVID-19.
closely monitor the health of staff
put up signs and explain the steps they are taking to protect residents’ health
Preventing the spread of coronavirus
Practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene is the best defence against most viruses. You should:
avoid contact with others by ‘social distancing’ – stay more than 1.5 metres away from people whenever possible
One way to slow the spread of viruses is social distancing (also called physical distancing). The more space between you and others, the harder it is for the virus to spread. Find out more about how you can practice social distancing.
While coronavirus is of concern, it is important to remember that most people displaying symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat or tiredness are likely suffering with a cold or other respiratory illness – not COVID-19.
If you have questions, you can call the National Coronavirus Helpline.
National Coronavirus Helpline
Call this line if you are seeking information on coronavirus (COVID-19). The line operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Interim advice on non-inpatient care of persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, including use of PPE
Interim recommendations for the use of PPE during hospital care of people with COVID-19
The highest priority of the Government is to ensure access to masks and other PPE for front line acute health service and primary care staff. This includes:
public hospitals (supporting the states and territories), general practices, community pharmacies, and other settings where people are most likely to be presenting with COVID-19
residential aged care facilities in the event of an outbreak
Controlled Health Organisations
GPs, community pharmacies, and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations should contact their Primary Health Network (PHN) to be supplied with masks. The PHN locator map can be found here.
Residential aged care providers can request PPE by sending an email to agedcareCOVIDPPE@health.gov.au
Priority will be given to aged care providers where there has been a confirmed case of COVID-19.
No other groups are currently being supplied with masks. The Department of Health is working to ensure supply of masks and other PPE. This page will be updated as more stocks of PPE are secured. Please continue to check the website regularly for updates.
Everyone seeking access to masks and other PPE from the National Medical Stockpile should continue attempts to purchase through commercial means.
Like others, health and aged care workers need to isolate themselves for 14 days after:
being in close contact with someone confirmed to have COVID-19
Let your employer know if you need to self-isolate. Depending on the type of work you do and if you are well, your employer may discuss other arrangements such as work from home.
Health care workers
had casual contact with COVID-19 cases and are well
directly cared for confirmed cases while using PPE properly
Monitor yourself for symptoms and self-isolate if you become unwell.
from 1 May, you must have your influenza vaccination to work in or visit an aged care facility
if you’re a residential aged care worker, you must not go to work if you have a fever or symptoms of a respiratory illness
It’s important to detect COVID-19 in health and aged care workers early.
you have symptoms of coronavirus
As an employer, you should brief all staff on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This includes your contract staff and domestic and cleaning staff.
let you know if they develop symptoms during the isolation period, especially if they have been in the workplace
Public health authorities may contact you if a staff member is confirmed to have coronavirus.
Residential aged care services must also ask their staff to provide details of their health status before entering the facility. This helps to protect our most vulnerable community members.
If self-isolation of staff is seriously affecting your service, you can conduct an individual risk assessment. You should conduct this with your local Public Health Unit.
Minimise the risk of being infected with coronavirus by:
using alcohol-based hand sanitiser before and after wearing gloves
If cleaning areas that a confirmed case or a person in isolation has visited frequently, wear a surgical mask.
If a confirmed case or a person in isolation is in a room you need to clean, ask them to put on a surgical mask.
At this time, we do not know if the virus can survive in sewerage. If you work closely with sewerage, take the same precautions outlined above.
Some coronaviruses can survive in the gastrointestinal tract. But it is highly unlikely that you will become infected through food if you:
Drinking water in Australia is high quality. We do not expect coronavirus to affect drinking water.
A 30-minute online training module is now available – How to protect yourself and the people you are caring for from infection with COVID-19.

QANTAS GROUP OUTLINES CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE IMPACT OF CORONAVIRUS-RELATED NETWORK CUTS
The Qantas Group has outlined the customer and employee impact of a huge drop in travel demand triggered by the public health response to the Coronavirus crisis.
“The efforts to contain the spread of Coronavirus have led to a huge drop in travel demand, the likes of which we have never seen before. This is having a devastating impact on all airlines.
“No airline in the world is immune to this, with the world’s leading carriers making deep cuts to flying schedules and jobs. Our strong balance sheet means we’ve entered this crisis in better shape than most and we’re taking action to make sure we can ride this out.
Customer contact centres are currently experiencing long wait times from people seeking to change their travel plans as a result of the Coronavirus. To help manage the demand we ask that customers only call if they have travel within the next 48 hours.
QANTAS GROUP UPDATE ON CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE
As a result of significant falls in travel demand due to Coronavirus, and new government restrictions across multiple jurisdictions in recent days, Qantas and Jetstar will make further and much larger cuts to domestic and international flying schedules.
Total Group International capacity will be cut by around 90 per cent until at least the end of May 2020. This is up from a 23 per cent reduction for the fourth quarter of FY20 announced last week and largely reflects the demand impact of severe quarantine requirements on people’s ability to travel overseas.
Total Group Domestic capacity will be cut by around 60 per cent until at least the end of May 2020. This is a major increase from the 5 per cent reduction for the fourth quarter of FY20 and reflects a rapid decline in forward travel demand due to government containment measures, corporate travel bans and a general pullback from everyday activities across the community.

Chicago Area Resident Tests Positive For Coronavirus, Cook County Department Of Public Health Confirms
Filed Under:Cook County, Coronavirus, Illinois, Tracking Coronavirus In Chicagoland
CHICAGO (CBS) — A patient in the Chicago area has tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Cook County Department of Public Health.
The tests resulted in “presumptive” positives and will have to be confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
RELATED: ‘No Reason To Panic’ After First Coronavirus Death In United States: President Trump | Washington State Reports First Coronavirus Death In U.S.
The patient is hospitalized in isolation at an undisclosed location, and CDC protocols have been implemented. The patient is from Cook County, officials said. It is currently not known how the patient may have contracted the virus. Also on Saturday, Loyola University in Chicago ordered all students studying in Italy to return to the United States by March 4 after an oubreak of the virus in that country. Those students will be required to stay at home for a 14-day medical evaluation period.
RELATED: What You Need To Know About Preparing For Coronavirus
Public health officials are working to find people who were in contact with the patient in an effort to reduce the risk of additional transmission. The state will request the CDC deploy a team to Illinois for support.
Governor JB Pritzker has requested that hospitals across the state implement additional testing to improve surveillance for the virus. Illinois was the first state to provide testing, and two more IDPH labs will be able to test specimens next week.
A Chicago couple was previously diagnosed with coronavirus and have both made full recoveries.
Reported coronavirus symptoms include mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Because the virus has not been found to be spreading widely in the U.S., the risk to the general public remains low, according to a release from IDPH. Residents are encouraged not to alter their daily routines but remember to cover coughs and sneezes, wash hands with warm soap and water and stay home when sick.

Second patient tests positive for COVID-19 coronavirus in Oregon, health officials say
State officials will announce Oregon’s first presumptive case of novel coronavirus COVID-19 in a press conference scheduled for 6 p.m. Friday evening. (MGN)
PORTLAND, Ore. – Health officials announced Sunday evening that a second person tested positive for COVID-19 in Oregon.
The second presumptive case of the coronavirus is a Washington County resident who lived with the initial case announced Friday, according to the Oregon Health Authority.
The second patient didn’t need medical attention, officials said, and they are currently isolated at home.
The cases are considered “presumptive” because the patients tested positive at the Oregon State Public Health Lab, however, the CDC has yet to conduct a second test confirming it as COVID-19.
“This presumptive positive test result was one of 9 total tests completed today (Sunday) by the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory,” a spokesperson for the state said. “Eight other tests were negative.”
The news comes as Washington state health officials announced a second person has died of coronavirus. Washington has 13 confirmed cases.
Because the current presumptive case of COVID-19 is affiliated with a local school, the Oregon Health Authority and the Oregon Department of Education partnered to create an “Information for Families and Schools” Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document. Additional updated information, including daily tracking of Persons Under Investigation (PUIs) and Persons Under Monitoring (PUMs) is available online.
On Wednesday, February 27, Oregon Governor Kate Brown launched the Coronavirus Response Team (CRT). The Oregon Health Authority and state agencies have worked through the weekend to address the spread of this new disease. The response team is tasked with coordinating state and local agencies and health authorities in preparation for response to the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.

Our customer service representatives will proactively reseat customers prior to door closure when loads and time permit.
The coronavirus outbreak continues to have a significant impact on travel demand. As a result, we've temporarily suspended operations at our United Polaris® lounges. For the most up-to-date information, visit our lounge locations page.
We ensure regular disinfection of common surfaces inside our airport terminals.
For passengers requiring a wheelchair, our cleaning and sanitizing specifications include wiping down all touch-points including push bar, brake handle, armrests, seat cushion and foot bar with wipes after every use. At the end of each day, we also spray a sanitizing disinfectant (in addition to the wipes) on all surfaces.
United uses an effective, high-grade disinfectant and multi-purpose cleaner.
Soon, we will start using an electrostatic fogger to disinfect the air and surfaces within the cabin on all international arrivals into the U.S.
When we are advised by the CDC of an employee or customer who has traveled onboard and who is potentially exhibiting coronavirus symptoms:
Most United aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art circulation systems, similar to those found in hospitals, which use a high-efficiency (HEPA) filter to circulate the air and removes up to 99.7% of airborne particles.
We've added supplies for our crews on segments flown to Alert Level 2 zones* and upward: gloves, masks, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, Sani-Com wipes, foaming hand soap, and disinfectant wipes as supply becomes available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content is a good secondary option

Could Coronavirus Kill a Million Americans?
Plan for the worst but work for the best to limit spread, improve survival, and reduce the societal costs of COVID-19

Soon after I became director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in June of 2009, I was asked to brief President Barack Obama about the emerging pandemic of H1N1 influenza. It was the first time I had briefed the president, there was a blizzard of information from CDC’s experts, and I had a videocall with dozens of CDC professionals—most of whom didn’t know I was about to brief the president—just before the briefing to make sure I had the latest information. It was still unclear how severe this strain of the virus was, though initial data from Mexico suggested that it could be bad. 
The president asked me, “We’re not going to see a million deaths in this country, are we, doctor?” 
I replied, with more certainty than I felt, “No, Mr. President, we won’t.” If asked the same question today about the novel coronavirus, I would have to reply, “I hope not, but that’s a possibility.”

Public health is crucial to both understanding and guiding the response to health threats. But if public health officials can’t do their jobs—because they’re distracted by the complex problem of cruise ships, or quarantines, or public perception—all of society suffers. 
During the three major emergency responses I oversaw at CDC in the past decade—H1N1, Ebola, and Zika—CDC and state and local health departments were able to learn quickly and act quickly to protect people. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented threat—never before has a new respiratory pathogen been identified then spread around the world. And as with those responses, public health must lead this response. We need to learn more, inform public and the media more, and let the best and most current data guide our actions and our statements. 
To act effectively, we must set priorities. Even if there were unlimited financial resources, human resources are limited. And if our most precious human resource—specialists who can help figure out how this virus is most likely to spread and what works best to reduce spread—are busy with lower-level priorities, no one is well served. For example, CDC staff should not be asked to manage any component of quarantine – other parts of the Department of Health and Human Services can do that, with CDC technical guidance. The CDC must be free to do what it does best: figure out how the infection is spreading and how best to reduce the spread.

What makes us think that COVID-19 could potentially cause a million deaths, and what can we do to reduce the potential impact? 
Worst-Case Scenario: A Million Deaths in the United States
The table below shows what would happen in the United States in a worst case scenario—but unfortunately one that’s not implausible. In this scenario, half of the U.S. population would get infected with COVID-19 and more than one million people would die. 
It’s likely that the case fatality rate is below 1 percent, and it’s possible that aggressive action could minimize the impact of the virus in the United States. But we need to plan for the worst and work for the best.
The understandable concern of political and other leaders has led to a focus on cruise ships, travel bans, and testing – important issues, but not interventions that will drastically reduce spread. Focus on these issues are making it harder for public health specialists to do what is already an extraordinarily difficult job. When the virus first enters a community, extensive efforts are needed to find cases, isolate contacts, and stop spread. But when there are multiple cases, it’s time to shift to broader measures to reduce risk. 
The United States has particular vulnerabilities. Not everyone has paid sick leave or access to health care. We already had an unacceptably a high number of hospital-acquired infections before coronavirus started spreading here, increasing the risk that health care workers and patients will get infected in health care facilities. And each state and community is diverse, with unique barriers to—and strengths in—the response. 
Here are the top ten actions we should take to reduce the risk a million people in this country will die from this pandemic:
Protect all who are vulnerable. For those with underlying conditions and older adults, increase social distancing—limit the number of people who come within six feet. Ensure that those who do have come into contact with them are not ill.
Accelerate work on effective treatments and vaccines. A vaccine could take one to two years to develop, and its success is far from certain, but we must try. Treatments could become available sooner, and they may increase survival for people who are infected—and, ideally, prevent some infections in people known to have been exposed. It’s time to start planning for distributing these treatments and vaccine if they become available, as they become available.
Vaccine development: research scientist Dan Galperin working as part of a team to develop a vaccine for Zika virus at the Protein Sciences Inc. headquarters in Meriden, Connecticut on June 20, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar
Cancel large gatherings, with the exception of geographic regions and populations not experiencing community transmission. Making that hard decision now could mean the difference between thousands and tens of thousands of infections in a community. If mass meetings do occur, older and medically vulnerable people should not attend. 
Protect our health care workers and our health care system. This means improving infection prevention and control, preparing to safely surge to care for an influx of patients, anticipating and quickly attending to the “worried well” and those with mild illness including people who flood health care facilities concerned their minor symptoms are COVID-19, making sure patients have a three-month supply of critical medicines such as those for diabetes, hypertension, and seizure disorder, and ensuring that hospitals have the ability to increase their capacity for intensive care, including for those needing ventilators. 
Don’t go out if ill. Let’s encourage our digital streaming services, including Netflix, Disney, Hulu, Apple, Amazon and delivery services to offer free services to people on home quarantine and in places with community transmission in order to make staying at home more pleasant—and therefore increase the chance people will comply.

Assess school closure. There are costs and benefits for each measure that we take. Closing schools can help during an influenza outbreak because children are a major source of the spread of influenza. We don’t yet know if children are a major source of the spread of this virus. We do know that closing schools can be disruptive—not only because of the educational impact, but because of the impact on families and on the many services schools provide.
Learn more as fast as we can. We learn more about how this virus spreads and how to stop it every day. We still need to learn how deadly the virus is and exactly how it spreads and how best to limit spread and reduce deaths. As we learn, we will inevitably need to adjust our actions. 
Speed matters—a lot. It’s been said that a week is a long time in politics. With COVID-19, a week is not a long time, it’s an eternity. The sooner we act, the more we can decrease the likelihood of a million deaths in the United States. Clear, consistent communication from credible sources builds public trust and saves lives. When faced with a scenario in which so many Americans could die, there’s no time for politics.

PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DECLARED IN BOSTON DUE TO CORONAVIRUS
PUBLIC_HEALTH_COMMISSION_LOGO
PUBLIC HEALTH COMMISSION
After the declaration of a public health emergency, Mayor Walsh also shared updates and announced new regulations for restaurants, bars and clubs.
Mayor Martin J. Walsh today announced the Boston Public Health Commission is declaring a public health emergency in the City of Boston, due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This step allows BPHC to increase the availability of staff and resources that will allow for enhanced reporting, information and resources shared among Boston's health and medical community. 
The declaration is an essential step to respond to and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and to protect the health and well-being of Boston's residents. This response to the COVID-19 pandemic requires an all hands on deck approach and calls for heightened coordination across BPHC's bureaus and programs, city departments and health care partners. Declared public health emergencies can aid cities in seeking additional resources and support from the state and federal government. Within the Boston Public Health Commission, the declaration allows for internal personnel and resources to be redirected towards the response effort. For more information on the City's public health crisis declaration, please visit here. 
"The health and safety of each and every Boston resident is our first priority. At this point, we are undoubtedly experiencing a public health emergency in the City of Boston, and it is clear that we need to activate every tool at our disposal," said Mayor Walsh. "We started to work on this public health declaration the moment we decided to close Boston Public Schools to ensure that we can activate and deploy all the public health resources and personnel necessary to meet the needs of our students, residents and anyone in our community facing challenges during this quickly changing situation."
Following the declaration of a public health emergency, Mayor Walsh also shared the following updates and announced new regulations for restaurants, bars and clubs:
"The Boston Public Schools is committed to meeting the needs of the community we serve, and that is especially true during times of uncertainty. With all hands on deck we are addressing this emergency head on," said BPS Superintendent Brenda Cassellius. "Nothing is more important than keeping our students, staff and families safe. We will continue to support our community by providing resources and materials for home learning, access to free meals, and timely updates on this unprecedented situation as it evolves."
*All McKinley Schools will be closed tomorrow, following the news that a member of the McKinley School community is currently being tested for COVID-19. At this time, there are no confirmed cases at the school, but BPS' top priority is to keep school communities safe and informed. All other schools, with the exception of the Eliot and McKinley schools, will be open tomorrow, Monday, March 16, during regular school hours. All BPS buses have been cleaned and disinfected and will run on normal schedules tomorrow.
Effective immediately, the Licensing Board for the City of Boston is requiring all restaurants (both establishments with a common victualler license and common victualler with alcoholic beverages license), bar rooms and night clubs in the city to reduce overall capacity by 50 percent, remove tables and chairs to reflect that reduced capacity, and follow the guidelines around social distancing. All licensed establishments will not be allowed to have lines outside, and hours across the board will be reduced to close at 11 p.m. Food drive through and delivery services may continue during an establishment's normal business hours. If any of these new regulations are violated, the licensed establishment will be shut down for 30 days. As a reminder, Governor Baker last week issued an emergency order prohibiting most gatherings over 250 people in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19.
As of today, beer gardens will not be opening until the declared public health emergency is over. All of these revised regulations included above will be in effect until the Licensing Board issues a notice that they are lifted. 
The Licensing Board has been working closely with licensed establishments in South Boston regarding the influx of patrons due to the St. Patrick's Day holiday and the ongoing public safety concerns regarding the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Based on the number of patrons in the area on Saturday, March 14 and health and safety concerns, over a dozen establishments have agreed to voluntarily close today, Sunday, March 15, 2020. 
To protect Bostonians and their families from the spread of the virus, residents are reminded to practice caution: wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol; avoid shaking hands; cover your coughs and sneezes; clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces; and avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you think you might be sick, please call your doctor or 311 to be connected to the Mayor's Health Line. Residents are also reminded to practice social distancing: keep your distance from others (six feet apart); avoid crowded places. 
Residents are asked to not call 9-1-1 unless you are experiencing a medical emergency. The City and BPHC will continue to provide updated information on bphc.org and boston.gov/coronavirus.

U.S. Will Miss Coronavirus Test Rollout Goal, Senators Say
Johns Hopkins' Nuzzo: New Virus Test Kits Likely to Reveal Undiagnosed Cases
The Trump administration won’t be able to meet its promised timeline of having a million coronavirus tests available by the end of the week, senators said after a briefing from health officials.
“There won’t be a million people to get a test by the end of the week,” Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida said in Washington Thursday. “It’s way smaller than that. And still, at this point, it’s still through public-health departments.”

The lack of testing kits for hospitals and health departments has created a gaping vulnerability in the U.S. effort to contain the virus. Success depends on local health departments being able to identify patients, isolate them, and stop them from infecting others. Instead, local health authorities have been finding some new patients only when they become more seriously ill, and then discovering clusters of infection around them without knowing where the web of transmission originated.
Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked Wednesday at a hearing in Congress whether the U.S. should be proactively testing people in hospitals and other settings.
An initial test developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was flawed, leading to weeks of delays for frustrated doctors and local public health officials who couldn’t check suspected cases. The U.S. has since made changes to the test and taken steps to expand availability.
But the rollout of the new tests has been accompanied by confusing messages from the administration about how many will be available, and when.
Earlier this week, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn told senators at a hearing that the U.S. would have the “capacity” to perform up to 1 million tests by the end of this week, a timetable reinforced by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at a White House briefing Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence said that 1.5 million tests would be going out.
On Thursday, Azar clarified some aspects of those figures. Speaking in Washington, he said that by the end of this week the CDC will have shipped enough tests to public health labs for 75,000 people to be tested. The manufacturer that works with CDC on testing, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., believes it will have sent out enough test kits for a million specimens by the end of this week, Azar said, which will be sufficient to test 400,000 people.
Those test kits are being sent out to hospitals, labs and other health facilities, Azar said, broadening the ability to check for the virus beyond public health departments. There should be tests for more than 4 million specimens shipped by next week, an amount “far far ahead of similarly impacted major countries around the world,” Azar said.
President Donald Trump has emphasized that the U.S. has few cases. On Twitter Thursday, he lauded a decision to limit travel from countries with ongoing outbreaks.
With approximately 100,000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide, and 3,280 deaths, the United States, because of quick action on closing our borders, has, as of now, only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!
But disease experts inside and outside the federal government have said the official CDC count of 129 cases is likely far too low, in part because of the diagnostic backlog.
Private companies are also racing to bring more coronavirus tests to market, with the help of a new FDA policy giving them leeway to quickly develop the screens and roll them out.
Lab testing giant Quest Diagnostics Inc. said Thursday that it has developed its own diagnostic for the coronavirus. The Secaucus, New Jersey-based company expects to begin doing coronavirus testing on samples from hospitals and clinics on Monday.
“It’s going to take a couple of weeks,” Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said. “Even though the kit arrives, they say by the end of the week, I don’t think they’ll be ready for tests by the end of the week.”
Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said senators were given a document with information about the coronavirus and how to avoid contracting it, but there were no details about how or where to be tested.
The Trump administration has come under criticism for the test-kit shortage, which local public health officials have said hampers their ability to survey the U.S. population for the virus.
“Our single greatest challenge is the lack of fast federal action to increase testing capacity -- without that, we cannot beat this epidemic back,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement Thursday as he announced two additional cases diagnosed in the city.

American Airlines Announces Additional Schedule Changes in Response to Customer Demand Related to COVID-19
FORT WORTH, Texas — American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) will implement a phased suspension of additional long-haul international flights from the U.S. starting on March 16. This suspension will last through May 6. This change is in response to decreased demand and changes to U.S. government travel restrictions due to coronavirus (COVID-19). The airline will:
These capacity reductions assume no slot waivers are in place other than those previously granted. At airports where demand exceeds airfield and/or terminal capacity, access is governed by slots that grant airlines permission to take off and land at specific times. Given the decrease in demand related to COVID-19, American has requested temporary relief from this usage requirement — otherwise known as requesting a slot waiver — to better align capacity with demand without the risk of losing valuable takeoff and landing slots for the future. American will continue to review its network and make adjustments as needed if waivers are granted.
American Airlines offers customers 6,800 daily flights to more than 365 destinations in 61 countries from its hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. With a shared purpose of caring for people on life’s journey, American’s 130,000 global team members serve more than 200 million customers annually. Since 2013, American has invested more than $28 billion in its product and people and now flies the youngest fleet among U.S. network carriers, equipped with industry-leading high-speed Wi-Fi, lie-flat seats, and more inflight entertainment and access to power.

A second person in U.S. — and King County — dies of novel coronavirus; more cases likely
A second death from COVID-19 struck King County and the United States on Sunday, placing the Northwest at the center of a mushrooming public-health crisis. The number of confirmed cases in the county jumped to 10, while health authorities warned it would likely rise, and new research indicated the novel coronavirus may have been spreading undetected in the region for weeks.
Local health officials announced a total of seven new cases Sunday. One of them — a patient in his 70s at EvergreenHealth — died, and the remaining six, ranging in age from their 40s to their 90s, were in critical condition. A patient in his 50s at EvergreenHealth died Friday, the first COVID-19 related fatality in the United States. 
Four of the new cases, including the second fatality, involved residents from Life Care, a skilled nursing facility in Kirkland. All suffered from underlying health issues, according to health department officials. 
As the numbers mounted, scientists, government officials, health care providers and area residents scrambled to brace for the next development — without knowing what that might be.
For the most part, Washington residents have reacted with reserved caution. Some pharmacies and big-box stores reported runs on items such as face masks and hand-sanitizers, while local and state governments activated and manned emergency operation centers in anticipation of additional infections.
Researchers looking into the genetic makeup of the virus have developed data they say suggests that COVID-19 has been spreading quietly for weeks in Washington — a possibility state health officials and the governor’s office acknowledged Sunday. 
 A series of tweets sent by Dr. Trevor  Bedford, a genetic and infectious disease researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and director of the Bedford Lab, said analysis of the genetic makeup of the COVID-19 virus indicates a case reported over the weekend appeared to be closely linked to another one reported on Jan. 19 in Snohomish County.
While it’s possible the genetic connection between the two cases is a coincidence, that scenario is unlikely, he wrote late Saturday. The genetic map was produced by scientists at the  Seattle Flu Study.
Gov. Jay Inslee, who toured state testing laboratories for the virus in Snohomish County on Sunday, has been briefed by state Department of Health (DOH) doctors about Bedford’s conclusions, spokeswoman Tara Lee said.
The state Department of Health said in a statement that it was “evaluating” Bedford’s findings and making plans for additional testing of residents who are or have been sick, DOH spokesperson Jamie Nixon said.
“It is definitely possible that COVID-19 has been circulating, with people experiencing mild symptoms just like the flu,” Nixon said. 
Bedford, in his research, suggested there may already be a “few hundred cases” of COVID-19 in Washington, where officials have reported both the nation’s first confirmed novel coronavirus infection in January and its first death Friday.
Health officials, so far, have identified 17 cases treated in Washington, including the two deaths: 10 in King County, three in Snohomish County and four in Spokane. 
State and local health officials and Inslee are expected to hold a news conference with additional information and updates Monday. 
The virus, technically known as SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in December in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to more than 60 countries and infected more than 88,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. There have been roughly 3,000 deaths, mostly elderly or individuals with other health problems. The virus’s symptoms include fever and respiratory distress. 
Most cases, though not all, have likely been contracted through community transmission, health officials said. 
In the case of a U.S. Postal Service worker, an agency spokesman said an employee had tested positive for COVID-19 in Federal Way after traveling to South Korea. She was recovering at home in stable condition after being diagnosed Thursday, said Ernie Swanson, a U.S. Postal Service spokesman.

After her diagnosis, officials at the facility contacted public health officials for Seattle and King County, who recommended the center continue with normal operations, Swanson said. 
In the wake of the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014, Harborview Medical Center created a special pathogen team to evaluate people at their homes for infection.

Makarewicz said the visits are one of the most effective ways to get samples from people who are exhibiting milder symptoms and might have had contact with a patient that has tested positive for COVID-19.
“It has kept folks out of our emergency department,” Makarewicz said.
Each sample costs about $2,500, including labor. Visits take about four hours on average, including travel time. Public Health screens patients for Makarewicz’s team to visit.
At four grocery stores in South Lake Union and Queen Anne, customer activity seemed typical for a Sunday afternoon. There were no major checkout lines or extremely barren shelves that sometimes occur during extreme weather conditions or major public health concerns. 
Ellen Kahan said she wasn’t planning to stock up on groceries or take any extra precautions other than “good habits and good ol’ soap and water.” She’s had experience planning for pandemics and health concerns as a former school administrator in the Edmonds School District. 
However, for the past few weeks, customers have been buying up items for cleaning and disinfecting skin and surfaces. 
Jesse Bame, an assistant manager at Bartell’s, said his store in Queen Anne has been sold out of hand sanitizer and face masks for the past two to three weeks. A sign in the window alerted would-be customers that those items were out of stock. 
Shipments of hand sanitizer and face masks are not expected to be restocked until April, he said. Customers still looking for sanitizing items, in the meantime, might have better luck finding antiseptic wipes, disinfectant spray, rubbing alcohol, and soap. 
Jesse Waldie said she gathered up all the hand sanitizer in her home because she hasn’t been able to find any in stores. Waldie, who was shopping with her 4-year-old daughter Vivian, said her family has been taking other safety precautions, limiting social interactions, in light of the virus.

King County health officials confirm 10 long-term care facilities have had coronavirus cases
King County public health officials confirmed Tuesday that residents or employees at 10 nursing homes and other residential or care communities in the county have tested positive for COVID-19.
The facilities with coronavirus cases include Life Care Center of Kirkland, Issaquah Nursing & Rehabilitation Center, Emerald Heights, Aegis Living at Marymoor, Redmond Care & Rehabilitation Center, Ida Culver House Ravenna, Boulevard Park Place Active Retirement Community, Madison House Independent & Assisted Living Community, The Gardens at Juanita Bay (Kirkland) and Columbia Lutheran Home.
In addition, Public Health — Seattle & King County reported 74 new COVID-19 cases today, bringing the total for King County to 190.
Two new deaths were confirmed in the county, marking a total of 22. Of those, 19 have been associated with Life Care Center of Kirkland.
“We’re going to see increasing cases for the foreseeable future. It will not be unusual for us to see a doubling of cases on a weekly basis, if not even more frequently,” said Patty Hayes, director of Public Health — Seattle & King County. “I’m assuming that we have it occurring low-level throughout the county.”
Hayes stressed that 80% of people who have the virus will experience only mild symptoms.

One person in King County has died due to a novel coronavirus infection, Public Health – Seattle & King County officials announced Saturday morning. It is the first death attributed to the virus in the United States.
Two people connected to a Kirkland long-term care facility have tested positive, officials said Saturday afternoon. A resident in her 70s is in serious condition, and a health employee in her 40s is stable. The long-term facility in Kirkland has 108 residents and 180 employees, according to the CDC.
At the Kirkland facility, 27 residents and 25 employees have symptoms.
The virus that began in China has infected more than 85,000 people globally.

"None of them are presenting any symptoms and we hope they will be tested and cleared soon," Kirkland City Manager Kurt Triplett said in the release. "In the meantime, other firefighters are covering through overtime and are continuing to respond to calls throughout the city."
The bishop of the Greater Northwest Area of The United Methodist Church, Elaine Stanovsky, published a blog post marking the beginning of the religious season of Lent with a reminder to take "reasonable precautions" from the World Health Organization, which included putting boxes of tissue in sanctuary pews and making hand sanitizer readily available.
The city of Redmond has quarantined seven firefighters who responded to calls at the Life Care Center in Kirkland in the last week, according to Pattijean Hooper, emergency manager for the city of Redmond. It's standard practice for organizations that share borders to support one another for calls, so these firefighters were supporting the Kirkland Fire Department.
“We don’t have any flights to Iran and we don’t have any direct flights to Italy,” said port spokesperson Perry Cooper. Passengers from South Korea, meanwhile, will now be subject to health screening before boarding flights to the United States, Cooper said. 
Lake Washington Institute of Technology says its campus will be disinfected
The school’s faculty has been in contact with the students and is awaiting guidance from King County public health officials, the statement said.
“The safety of our students, faculty and staff is our priority, so as a precautionary measure, we are disinfecting the college campus (Sunday),” Morrison wrote.
Life Care Center is monitoring residents and employees for specific symptoms — fever, cough and shortness of breath — to distinguish possible cases of coronavirus from the various cold and flu-like symptoms “normal this time of year,” according to a statement released by the facility. It may send more patients to the hospital for formal testing, which is not being performed at the facility.
Family of Snohomish County teen with coronavirus releases statement
The family of the Henry M. Jackson High student confirmed to have coronavirus has released a statement through the Snohomish Health District:
"Our child became ill with flu-like symptoms on Monday morning. We took the necessary steps to have him seen by medical professionals and to be tested for the flu. We didn’t learn of the testing of COVID-19 until Friday morning, after our now symptom-free child left for school. He promptly returned home before school started. We are taking this situation very seriously. Please know that we have been following all guidance and instructions from both the healthcare providers that treated our son, as well the Snohomish Health District. We understand the concerns and anxiety raised, but we ask that the community and media please respect our family’s privacy."
At Jackson High in Mill Creek, district officials have shut down the campus for “deep disinfecting” Friday night through Monday.
The infected student, as well as a few people he had close contact with at school, have been quarantined at home. The school nurse will be in contact with all families whose students are quarantined on Monday to organize academic support while they’re out of school, said Kathy Reeves, a spokeswoman for Everett Public Schools.
Other school districts in the area also have plans in place. Bothell High School recently canceled two days of class out of an abundance of caution, after hearing one of their staff members had a family member who was showing symptoms of the virus. The family member has since tested negative for COVID-19, and the school will reopen Monday.

CDC takes blame for Trump misidentifying coronavirus fatality as a woman
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that officials erroneously identified the man who died from coronavirus as a woman during a Saturday morning briefing with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.
In a news conference, Trump said that a "wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient, in her late 50s," had died. Washington state health officials later said that the patient is a man.
What are the quarantine powers in Washington state?
What are the quarantine powers in Washington state?
Recent weeks have brought dramatic examples of actions in other nations to stop the spread of the coronavirus that have involved isolating entire cities or regions.
In the United States, the authority to impose a quarantine is a legal power that can used at multiple levels of government to combat an outbreak of a communicable illness.
State and local governments are primarily responsible for this task. But the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention is charged with monitoring and responding to the spread of communicable disease across national or state borders, or if a state government is unwilling or unable to respond, according to the  National Conference of State Legislatures.
In Washington, rules passed by the state Board of Health, based on state law, detail the power wielded by local health officers on the frontlines of an outbreak of contagious disease. They state that a local health officer, “at his or her sole discretion”  can issue an emergency detention that causes “ a  person or group of persons” to be immediately detained for a period of up to 10 days for purposes of isolation of quarantine.
That power can only be exercised after reasonable efforts are made to obtain voluntary compliance with requests for medical examination, testing and treatment, and the health officer must issue a written order detailing why the action is necessary.
For enforcement, the health officer can invoke the powers of police officers, sheriffs, and constables.
Under the rules, a health officer can also petition a Superior Court for the right to continue to enforce isolation or quarantine for a period of up to 30 days.
The court should grant the petition if it finds “clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that isolation or quarantine is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent risk to the health and safety of others.”
People who have been subject to a quarantine have a right to petition a Superior Court for release, according to the state regulations.
King County executive activates emergency operations centers
King County Executive Dow Constantine has activated an emergency operations center in response to the COVID-19 cases. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she plans to do the same for the City of Seattle. The emergency operations centers allow King County cities to coordinate responses together.
Anyone who lives and works in Seattle, or travels through the city, can sign up for Alert Seattle, the official emergency notification system that sends text messages, emails and voices messages during emergencies.
The city is using a pandemic incident framework that also was used during 2009’s H1N1 outbreak and that has been updated since then, Durkan’s office said.
Durkan is “prepared to deploy any emergency orders and/or issue additional travel guidance,” Senior Deputy Mayor Mike Fong wrote Saturday in an email to City Council members.
Interventions could potentially include cancellations of gatherings and closures of public buildings, according to a Washington State Department of Health guide shared by Durkan's office.
“We should assume that a large-scale health emergency like a serious pandemic will, for some limited but undefined time period, stress our health care, public health and other community support systems, and pose communication challenges requiring clear and accurate messages from authoritative sources and constant vigilance for misinformation,” he wrote.
Hospitals: Call before you arrive if you're feeling ill
The message from hospitals is clear: if you suspect you might be infected, call your healthcare provider before you show up. That could be a primary care physician, an online health clinic, an urgent care center or another source. If fewer patients come to hospitals, doctors can focus on the most serious cases.
“We really want people to call if they fit any of the criteria, if they’re confused if they have the flu, coronavirus, or something else,” said Susan Gregg, spokeswoman for UW Medicine.
Also, hospitals in the UW system are deploying doctors to assess patients in their homes, she said.
North American professional sports are going on as scheduled, but officials from the National Basketball Association, National Hockey League and Major League Baseball say they are consulting with the CDC about COVID-19. The NHL, which has teams based in Canada, is in contact with the CDC and Public Health Canada.
LAKE OSWEGO, Oregon — Forest Hills Elementary, a small brick school on a quiet, residential street in the Portland suburb of Lake Oswego, is shut down at least through Wednesday after an employee was diagnosed Friday evening with a presumptive case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.  Lake Oswego School District Superintendent Lora de la Cruz, speaking Saturday at a news conference, said that the step was taken “out of an abundance of caution,” and to give the opportunity for a contractor to conduct a deep cleaning of the building.
The employee in Clackamas County was last in the school Feb. 19, and became ill enough to be hospitalized. De la Cruz said that the staffer’s job did not put him in the kind of close contact with students that is believed to be necessary to transmit the virus.
But some colleagues who visited him in the hospital have been asked to stay home for a two-week period, and his case is now the focal point of an intensive public health investigation that involves Clackamas County and nearby Washington County, where the employee resides.  And the district is investigating whether there has been any increase in school absences due to illness in recent weeks.
For residents of the neighborhood, the news of this school’s presumptive case of the virus brought a story that has dominated international news for weeks so much close to their homes.
"I am concerned," said Mary Wood, a 50-year resident of the neighborhood, who lives across the street from the school. “My son called from Eugene (Oregon) and suggested I self-quarantine."
EvergreenHealth discouraging visitors to Kirkland campus
EvergreenHealth is discouraging visitors to its Kirkland campus, where one patient who tested positive for coronavirus is currently in isolation and receiving treatment. The medical center said it is discouraging visitors "to ensure the health and safety of our patients, staff and community."

Lawmakers responding to virus outbreak
In Olympia, Washington lawmakers are budgeting new funds to respond to the virus.
The proposed state supplemental budget passed Thursday by Senate lawmakers includes $10 million, the bulk of which would go to local health districts to aid their response to the virus. Another chunk of that money would fund a dedicated call center, as well as monitoring of known cases inside the state.
Senate lawmakers also budgeted an additional $1 million to an economic development fund to help businesses whose trade is impacted. Southwest Washington is already being pinched by a trade slowdown associated with the outbreaks, said Sen. Dean Takko, D-Longview, in a floor speech on the budget.
The budget proposal passed Friday evening by House lawmakers includes $5 million for the state’s disaster-response account to help respond to the virus.
Health officials: All local cases were acquired in Seattle area
All local cases announced Saturday were acquired through "community transmission" in the Seattle area, said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Public Health – Seattle & King County. That means none of the patients had traveled overseas.
Officials declined to share what underlying health condition the patient who died had, citing patient privacy.
Inslee declares state of emergency
Gov. Jay Inslee has declared a state of emergency in response to the new cases. The proclamation allows state agencies to “use all resources necessary to prepare for and respond to the outbreak.” 
King County Metro is crafting protocols and taking guidance from public health departments. There will be a heightened response to rider reports of unsanitary conditions, and buses will be pulled out of service immediately if need be. Officials are urging people with cold and flu symptoms to stay off buses. 
State health officer: 'We are rapidly shifting our operations'
Dr. Kathy Lofy, State Health Officer, said if there are additional cases in Washington, officials might consider additional measures like canceling large public events, but do not yet feel that is necessary.
King County is also exploring options for people who are homeless to rest and recover from COVID-19 away from shelter situations. Healthcare for the Homeless Network has scheduled four training across the county for human services providers to review and answer questions.
Life Care in Kirkland, where a resident and an employee both tested positive for coronavirus, isn't allowing any visits from family members, volunteers and vendors, Executive Director Ellie Basham said in a statement. Concerned family members or responsible parties may call our facility number at 425-823-2323 with any questions.
“It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19,” Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement, referring to the illness caused by the virus. “Our hearts go out to their family and friends. We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus.”

Plus, it may be time for a general strike. This is The COVID-19 Daily Report for March 26, 2020.
Last night, the Senate approved the $2.2 trillion coronavirus economic response package, an hour after the final text was released, in a remarkable 96-0 vote. This morning, we learned that 3.283 million Americans filed first-time jobless claims in the week ending March 21. The latter explains the former. We’re in at least a temporary pandemic depression, and the relief that the Senate bill will provide was such that no Senator would have dared vote against it. The House will vote on Friday, and without remote voting in place, no House member will be the one to deny unanimous consent and force their colleagues back to Washington, risking their own health, on a bill that will get overwhelming support. That was the whole point of the foot-dragging on remote voting, to make dissent impossible.
Hospital industry: This is also good, over $100 billion for hospitals struggling under the weight of new COVID-19 cases. Some of that money will go toward procuring needed equipment. Yet by giving it to hospitals directly instead of nationalizing the supply chain, the money will necessarily buy less. Hospitals will remain pitted against one another amid a small chain of producers, subject to monopsony price-gouging. If this money were put into a Defense Production Act fund, the government would balance the scales, controlling supply and coordinating it to who needs it most.
New York Times: As of this morning, 68,534 U.S. cases (53,934), 990 deaths (728). An incredible 33,000 of those cases, almost half, are in New York state. Johns Hopkins University: 69,197 cases (55,238), 869 deaths (802). The COVID-19 Tracker shows 65,512 cases (53,192) and 936 deaths (709), and 484,286 tests completed (367,710). This is a real breakthrough on testing, which has leapt up to a South Korea-like level. But deaths continue to rise exponentially. The worst is yet to come.
That was said to me and labor reporter Mike Elk in 2011, in Madison, Wisconsin during the worker uprising there against Scott Walker, by a guy wearing an International Workers of the World hat. And if Donald Trump tries to prematurely send people back to work amid a pandemic, that talk will grow. In fact, it’s already happening.
There’s a history here; a general strike occurred in 1919, during the influenza pandemic. You cannot credibly send workers into a meat grinder without pushback; Chinese factory workers were slow to return as well. The only way to return America to normal is to beat the pandemic, with social distancing and lockdown measures. There are no shortcuts, and attempts to create one will be met with massive unrest.
In 2021, expect much higher private insurance premiums to cover all this. (Modern Healthcare)

Twelve years later, virtually the same course of events is taking place. After just a couple weeks of extreme social distancing measures, the Treasury Department asked for a large bailout, this time of the entire corporate sector. The bill as written initially would have made all bailout activities secret for six months. Democrats balked, called it a slush fund and worse, and then agreed to a few mostly meaningless bits of oversight and some promises to help ordinary people. In fact they’re the same bits of oversight from the 2008 TARP bailout: a five-member oversight panel and an inspector general for the program.
So it’s not a $2 trillion bill, it’s closer to $6 trillion, and $4.3 trillion of it comes in the form of a bazooka aimed at CEOs and shareholders, with almost no conditions attached. At the moment nobody’s seen language, but there’s apparently only a buyback ban for the term of the loan. The money cannon can therefore go to executive compensation or mergers or wholesale purchases of distressed businesses or whatever other financial engineering the accounting department can muster. And once the company returns to health, it can leak out cash to investors (and during the loan too, in dividends). There’s no requirement to keep workers hired; in fact, the (necessary) provision to boost unemployment insurance for four months to 100 percent of median salary (including furloughed workers, gig workers and freelancers) means that these companies can fire with relative impunity. Members of Trump’s family can’t get bailout funds, so, yay.
This is a robbery in progress. And it’s not a bailout for the coronavirus. It’s a bailout for twelve years of corporate irresponsibility that made these companies so fragile that a few weeks of disruption would destroy them. The short-termism and lack of capital reserves funneled record profits into a bathtub of cash for investors. That’s who’s being made whole, financiers and the small slice of the public that owns more than a trivial amount of stocks. In fact they’ve already been made whole; yesterday Wall Street got the word that they’d be saved and stocks and bonds went wild. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is running these bailout programs for the Fed, and could explicitly profit if the Fed buys its funds, which it probably will.
There’s also $150 billion for state and local governments and $130 billion for hospitals (though not much for actual equipment, it seems to fix certain existing problems with their businesses).
This bill is an outrageous betrayal, a testament to how power works and saves itself. And Congress is about to put itself on the hook for it. Schumer has the Senate under his thumb, and he praised this bill at 2am this morning, so that’s a done deal. Any House member could deny unanimous consent and stop this, but that would require getting to Washington, forcing everyone else back to Washington in the middle of a pandemic, and delay what is needed (if temporary) relief for everyday people. I doubt anyone will do it. Pelosi purposefully put this in place before turning to remote voting to make such an action toxic.
New York Times: As of this morning, 53,934 U.S. cases (43,499), 728 deaths (537). Johns Hopkins University: 55,238 cases (46,481), 802 deaths (593), 192 in New York City alone. The rate of death, the only certain rate (case rate is in part finding existing ones from increases in testing) is increasing by worrying amounts, though there’s a bleak hope that the death curves in California and Washington are starting to flatten. The COVID-19 Tracker shows 53,192 cases (43,630) and 709 deaths (535), and 367,710 tests completed (303,014). We’ve peaked the past two days at around 64,000 tests; that’s not quite good enough for proper testing and contact tracing.
I was on the BradCast with Brad Friedman talking about various coronavirus-related issues. You can hear that at this link.
No doubt after yesterday’s Unsanitized laced into the lack of wartime mobilization and central planning to deal with the rapidly moving outbreak in the U.S., the Federal Emergency Management Agency actually used the Defense Production Act to secure 60,000 testing kits. Well, they used it for about 8 hours; later on the agency said they didn’t need to go that route. At least they conserved that whopping $750 million appropriation that they can spend on contracts.

The Coronavirus Isn’t Just A Blue State Problem
Filed under Coronavirus
Washington state was the initial epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. And New York is now the hardest-hit part of the country so far, with hospitalizations increasing at rapid rates — more than 37,000 people had been diagnosed with the coronavirus in New York as of late Thursday afternoon.
Because COVID-19 hit blue, coastal states first, and because politics is politics, the response to the pandemic hasn’t exactly been apolitical.
But blue states are hardly alone in what is becoming a nationwide epidemic. Jefferson Parish, Louisiana — which went for Trump by 15 percentage points in 2016 — has a death rate about equal to that of Manhattan. And as terrifying as the hospital situation is in New York City, hospital capacity is also under strain in states such as Michigan and Georgia.
Moreover, blue states have conducted more tests per capita than red states, so — given that the large majority of coronavirus cases remain undetected — the lower rate of cases in red states may partially be an artifact of less testing.
Here is the data as of late Thursday afternoon, with states sorted by the increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases between Monday (March 23) and Thursday (March 26).2
Detected COVID-19 cases are on the rise in red states
Known COVID-19 cases as of March 23 and March 26, according to The COVID Tracking Project
Nine of the 10 states that have seen the most rapid increase in coronavirus from Monday to Thursday are states that voted for Trump in 2016, led by Texas, where the number of reported cases increased by 297 percent.
For now, states Clinton won do have considerably more total reported cases. As of Thursday, Clinton states had 4.29 positive tests per 10,000 people, as compared to 1.13 per 10,000 people in Trump states. A lot of that difference is attributable to New York; without New York, Clinton states have 1.89 cases per 10,000 people.
Hopefully, the rate of increase will slow in both types of states as we begin to see further effects of social distancing measures in the data. However, these measures were generally enacted earlier and have been more forceful in blue states. That means the rate at which new cases are being diagnosed could slow down faster in blue states than in red states, meaning that red states would catch up earlier.
Blue states have also conducted more testing than red states. In states with reliable estimates of the number of positive and negative tests as of Thursday night,3
Clinton states had conducted 21.8 tests per 10,000 people as compared to 12.5 tests per 10,000 people in Trump states.4
Blue states have done more COVID-19 testing
Tests completed per capita as of March 26, in states with reliable reporting on the number of negative tests
STATE TESTS COMPLETED PER 10K PEOPLE* 2016 WINNER
* Excluding tests that are listed as pending.
COVID-19 has also led to a slightly higher case fatality rate (the number of deaths as a share of the number of known cases) in red states so far. As of Thursday evening, the death rate per case was 1.7 percent in Trump states as compared to 1.3 percent in Clinton states. This could reflect a variety of factors, including potential underreporting of cases in Trump states,5
the age and health of the populations in each set of states, or the efficacy of responses by local health care systems.
However, the higher fatality rate it is a somewhat troubling sign for red states given that many of them are generally at an earlier point in their epidemic curves, meaning that many people who have acquired COVID-19 in those states have done so recently and have not yet developed the most serious symptoms that could lead to long-term hospitalization or death.

Find Texas case counts on our COVID-19 case dashboard.
The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in responding to the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) that is causing an outbreak of respiratory illness worldwide.
Case counts can now be found on the COVID-19 case dashboard. Accessible version (Excel)
Browse this site for what to do if you're sick, testing information, symptoms, and prevention tips to help DSHS share facts, not fear.
Hospitals, healthcare professionals, local public health, community leaders, and others can find resources throughout this website to help them in their response to COVID‑19.
Texas Executive Orders & Public Health Disaster Declaration
On March 26, 2020, Gov. Abbot issued a self-quarantine edict requiring air travelers from the tri-state area near New York City and from New Orleans to self-quarantine for 14 days after they arrive. Instructions for self-quarantined travelers can be found on the CDC COVID-19 Traveler Information Card.
On March 19, 2020, Dr. John Hellerstedt, commissioner of Texas DSHS, declared a public health disaster in Texas, because COVID-19 “has created an immediate threat, poses a high risk of death to a large number of people, and creates a substantial risk of public exposure because of the disease’s method of transmission and evidence that there is community spread in Texas.”
CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (CDC)
Symptoms of COVID‑19 may show up 2‑14 days after exposure. The steps you should take if you think you are sick with COVID‑19 depend on whether you have a higher risk of developing severe illness.
Heart Disease
Weakened Immune Systems
People 65 years or older, and/or people with medical issues, like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, or a weakened immune system, are at a higher risk for getting very sick from COVID‑19.
If you are a high-risk individual and you develop fever or symptoms, call your doctor.
If you are not sick enough to be hospitalized, you can recover at home. Follow your doctor's instructions and refer to CDC recommendations for how to take care of yourself at home.
If you are in generally good health and have mild symptoms, stay home and take care of yourself like you would for a cold or the flu.
If symptoms worsen, call your doctor.
If you are sick or are caring for someone who is sick, you can use the Coronavirus Self-Checker on the CDC’s Symptoms & Testing page to help you make decisions about seeking appropriate medical care.
If you need help finding a doctor or accessing medical care, call 2‑1‑1 and they can direct you to low- or no-cost providers in your area.
Information on disinfecting your home if someone is sick can also be found on the CDC website:
DISINFECTING YOUR HOME (CDC)
COVID-19 Testing
If you do not have health insurance, you can still get tested for COVID‑19 if your doctor or healthcare provider recommends it.
For information about testing, you just need to call your doctor and/or access care the way you usually do. If you need help finding a doctor or accessing medical care, call 2‑1‑1 and they can direct you to low- or no-cost providers in your area.
Symptoms of COVID-19
Patients with COVID‑19 have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness. Symptoms can include:
Learn more about COVID‑19 symptoms on the CDC website.
Prevention of COVID-19
There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID‑19. The best way to prevent infection is to take steps to avoid exposure to this virus, which are similar to the steps you take to avoid the flu.
Disinfect often touched surfaces.
DSHS recommends these everyday actions to help prevent the spread of any respiratory virus, including COVID‑19:
If no soap and water are available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Disinfect surfaces, buttons, handles, knobs, and other places touched often.
DSHS also recommends that you start practicing social distancing. Social distancing involves staying away from other people to avoid catching or spreading illness. It's a fancy term for avoiding crowds and minimizing physical contact. This could mean avoiding concerts or weddings, skipping the handshake, and/or staying at least six feet away from others.
How COVID-19 Spreads
Current understanding about how the virus that causes COVID‑19 spreads is largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses.
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person:
Via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

Our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic has moved here
CNN's town hall on the coronavirus, addressing facts, fears, and medical guidance, has now finished. Here's what was discussed:
Vaccine trials: CNN medical analyst Dr. Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant professor of infectious diseases, said it is just the "very beginning" of a long process of research and studies.
Reinfection: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said while "there is no design study that has proven that you are 'protected'" from getting reinfected, "projecting what we know about viruses, I would say that there is a very good chance that you're protected."
Young people need to take pandemic seriously: "We are getting more and more information that someone can transmit even when they are asymptomatic. So in order to protect oneself, society and particularly the vulnerable people, we've really got to adhere to the physical separation," said Fauci.
Increased contact tracing can help save lives: Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program said that, "it is possible to do contact tracing even under the most difficult circumstances, but it does require a real scale-up in public health capacity."
Assessing your own mental health: Psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer  likened the public's response to the coronavirus to the stages of grief, and encouraged people to find "coping strategies" to keep their stress levels down.
How do you assess and manage your own mental health?
Question: At CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta asked psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer about the best ways for people to manage and assess there own mental health, especially considering that for many, the pandemic is not a single traumatic even but rather a long period of significant change.
Answer: Schmelzer likened the public's response to the coronavirus to the stages of grief, and encouraged people to find "coping strategies" to keep their stress levels down.
BREAKING: California governor orders all 40 million residents to stay at home to limit outbreak
All 40 million residents in the state of California have been ordered to stay home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
The state is one of the worst affected in the US after Washington and New York. There are now 910 coronavirus cases in California, including 19 deaths.
New York has at least 5,298 cases, while Washington has at least 1,376 confirmed cases.
Town hall: How should grandparents explain social distancing to their young grandchildren?
Question: Jackie Stephens, a 65-year-old grandmother with underlying health conditions from Idaho, wants to know how best to explain to her "timid, easily frightened" 3-year-old grandson that he can't come into physical contact with her.
Will the Olympics go ahead? The coming weeks will tell: "I have no reason to believe they're not making progress in Japan," said Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program.
"And the Olympics is a major global event. And I think Japan still has hope the Olympics will happen, but that is going to be based on a risk management decision. And obviously the government of Japan will not make a decision to go ahead if there is danger to athletes, danger to spectators. And a lot of that will depend on how the disease evolves in the coming few weeks."
What other measures is India taking? The Indian government is directing state governments to advise citizens above 65 and children below 10 to stay home. This excludes public representatives, medical professionals and government employees. 
States have also been requested to enforce work from home for private sector employees, except those working in emergency or essential services.
There are more than 190 confirmed cases in India and four deaths.
Town hall: Increased contact tracing can help save lives in this crisis
CNN's Anderson Cooper and Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta speak to Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program about the US' capacity to test for the coronavirus and do contact tracing.
Learning from Italy: "I think other countries really, really need to step up and learn the lessons that are being learned in Italy right now. We have to push this virus back. It's not just enough to do social distancing. It's good to have that, it's great to separate people, but we have to be able to go after the virus," Ryan said.
Tailoring responses: "You've got 50 states. You've got a different situation in each of those states. And you need to tailor the responses in each of those states. And if you've got a chance you need to go after the virus. And contact tracing and isolation of cases is still a strategy that can be used," Ryan said.
Need to identify cases: "It's really important we identify all confirmed cases. We need to test suspected cases. We need those cases to be isolated, and it is difficult in a very intense environment. It's difficult to do the kind of detailed contact tracing. In Ebola, at the peak of the outbreak, we were tracing 25,000 contacts a day in the middle of a war zone. It is possible to do contact tracing even under the most difficult circumstances, but it does require a real scale-up in public health capacity. And where that can be done and the virus can be pushed back, we can save lives," Ryan said.
CNN's Dan Simon and Gary Tuchman joined the coronavirus town hall from San Francisco and Georgia's St. Simons Island.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic Wednesday night, telling CNN “there’s a massive national crisis going on and he’s consistently late and very marginal in what he does.”
“He’s taking actions that are far, far behind the curve and aren’t addressing the core concerns and talking about a massive number of new cases we expect of coronavirus, we’re almost to 2,000 cases right now in New York City alone,” de Blasio told CNN. “That’s going to cause a surge into our hospitals, they’re going to be using up their supplies rapidly in an unprecedented manor.”
He added that the President “has not done anything to maximize the amount of medical supplies being produced and to ensure they are being distributed where they are needed most in the United States."

Nine coronavirus tests are now FDA-authorized for emergency use
The US Food and Drug Administration has now authorized nine coronavirus tests for emergency use. 
The maker of one of those tests, Abbott, promised on Wednesday to ship 150,000 laboratory tests “immediately." 
The authorizations are somewhat of a formality. FDA guidance issued earlier this week allows companies to manufacture and ship tests before receiving permission.
Yet the authorizations still offer a stamp of approval to tests, signaling that federal regulators are satisfied with their validation data and believe their benefits outweigh any risks, such as false positives or negatives.
Four other tests were authorized by the FDA this week; Abbott’s test is the fifth, for a total of nine.
 Unlike tests that give results at home or in a doctor’s office, coronavirus tests must be run on specialized equipment in clinical labs.
The Abbott system can process up to 470 tests per day, according to the company, whose test was authorized Tuesday. The Swiss firm Roche, whose test was greenlit last week, says its systems can process up to 960 results in eight hours. 
Such “high-throughput” systems have the potential to dramatically increase testing capacity in the United States. But shortages of the people and tools needed to run the tests – like health care workers and cotton swabs – could still slow testing.

Increasing supply of necessary medical equipment for Covid-19 will not resolve the crisis, US surgeon general says
Although the United States government is making every effort to provide necessary supplies in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, supplies will only help so much, Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said at a town hall for the American Society of Anesthesiologists on Thursday.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force has provided 9 million N95 respirators from the Strategic National Stockpile, and it has worked with manufacturers to increase production of N95 respirators to 100 million a month, according to Adams.
“A lot of the capacity that folks are looking for is already out there. It’s sitting on shelves in surgery centers. It’s sitting in hospitals. It’s just misaligned,” Adams said. “I really want you all to think about how you can help us fix that misalignment.”
He also talked about the importance of testing. “By this time next week, we expect to be close to two million tests,” he said.
Other than provision of medical supplies to areas that need them most, Adams reiterated the importance of the general public taking social distancing and good hygiene practices seriously. According to Adams, the disease runs its course about six to eight weeks after strict social distancing, as seen in China and other parts of Asia.
By decreasing the number of infected people, he explained, the demand for supplies would also decrease. “The way we get out of this crisis is to lower demand,” he said.
24 detainees have tested positive for coronavirus in a Chicago jail
At least 24 detainees at Cook County Jail in Chicago have tested positive for coronavirus, the sheriff's office said in a statement Thursday.
The jail complex currently houses around 5,400 detainees. A total of 89 detainees exhibiting flu-like symptoms have been tested so far. Of those, 24 tested positive, two negative, while an additional 63 have pending test results.
Additionally, nine Cook County Sheriff’s Office employees have now tested positive for coronavirus.
Outbreaks have previously been reported in prisons and jails in China, and there have been calls for non-violent prisoners to be released in the US to reduce overcrowding and prevent the spread of the virus among detained populations.
CNN's town hall on the coronavirus pandemic has ended. Here are the highlights
CNN's global town hall on the coronavirus town hall has just ended for the night.
This isn't over yet: The US has not yet peaked, and we won't be able to return to normal life by April, said Bill Gates and top US infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci.
We need more testing: There is still a lot we don't know about the disease and how long it will last -- but ratcheting up testing and collecting more data will give us a better idea in the coming weeks and months.
Stay vigilant: We all still need to be continuing preventative measures like thoroughly washing our hands, social distancing, and home isolation.
But also take care of yourself: Mental health is especially important in times like these, and there are resources in your community or through remote means that can help combat feelings of helplessness, anxiety, and depression.
What Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky is doing to stay in shape during the coronavirus pandemic
Like all Americans, Katie Ledecky has been forced to adjust her lifestyle under self-quarantine as the country struggles against the coronavirus pandemic.
Ledecky shared how she is training during this challenging time during an interview on CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday night.
"Goal setting has been crucial to me and keeps me motivated every day to get out of bed and work out hard. And I want to represent team USA next year and do it really well. I think it's going to be really cool if everything comes together. Hopefully that, hopefully we can continue to fight this disease and reduce the spread and be able to compete in Tokyo. But I think when we get there, it's going to be a true celebration of the world being able to come together again," she said.
Countless sporting events have been canceled or postponed around the world over the coronavirus pandemic.
It's "obviously disappointing, but it was certainly the right call," she said. "It doesn't really make sense to bring everyone from around the world together in the middle of a pandemic."
For now, Ledecky is hunkering down and social distancing like everybody else. "I'm not doing anything besides staying in my apartment trying to stay in shape the best I can," she said.
We need to take care of our mental health during this pandemic, psychiatrist says
The coronavirus pandemic isn't just having a public health and economic toll on the world -- it threatens our mental health, too.
But there are things we can do to combat feelings of helplessness, panic, depression, and anxiety, said psychiatrist Dr. Christine Moutier on CNN's ongoing coronavirus town hall.
If you feel like you want to reach out to a professional for help, but are in self isolation or home quarantine, there are telehealth options and online resources that could offer remote counseling, she added.
"It's a time when people with a history of mental health conditions need to take extra special care of their mental health right now."

With the growing number of coronavirus cases, California is the next New York and New York is the next Italy, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told reporters Thursday.
"In the same way that New York is now the next Italy, and Italy is the next Iran, and Iran is the next China, no matter where you live, you are the next next, this virus doesn't care where you live," said Mayor Garcetti, echoing comments he previously made to CNN.
The mayor also announced that the city is partnering with fashion brand Reformation to help produce masks with guidance from health care company Kaiser Permanente.
The city has launched LA Projects to collaborate with garment and apparel manufacturers to mass produce non-medical masks for non-medical staff at hospitals, grocery workers, and other Angelenos on the front lines. The goal is to produce 5 million non-medical masks, Garcetti said.
Travel to Hawaii drops by 87% after new coronavirus restrictions
"We must try to stop visitors from coming to Hawaii in order to stop the spread of Covid-19 into our communities,” Gov. Ige said
The state is backing up its request for fewer visitors with an order that all arrivals -- residents and visitors -- immediately enter a 14-day quarantine upon entering the state. Visitors must spend that time in their hotel room at their own expense, or face a possible criminal charge if they ignore the order.
Gov. Ige says they are also working with the US Army Corps of Engineers to find places where a field hospital could be set up if one is necessary. A site survey already has been done at the exhibition hall of Hawaii Convention Center, according to Ige.

Bolivia closes border to curb coronavirus spread
Bolivia’s borders will be closed due to the ongoing threat of coronavirus, Interim President Jeanine Áñez announced in a statement released by her office on Tuesday.
Effective Thursday, only Bolivian citizens and residents may enter the country, the statement said. Travelers entering the country must follow protocols implemented by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization.
A US state heavily dependent on tourism dollars is making the extraordinary request for visitors to stay away due to the coronavirus. 
Ige said additional steps are coming, as they will screen all passengers disembarking from cruise ships starting Friday. Physicians will check the temperature of each passenger and conduct interviews about their health. Ige said they intend to do the same screenings for airport arrivals as soon as possible.

The governor of Nevada is strongly advising as many residents as possible to stay home indefinitely to slow the spread of coronavirus.
When Trump was asked at the coronavirus task force briefing whether he was considering closing the US land borders on Tuesday, he said, "I don't want to say that, but we are discussing things with Canada and we're discussing things with Mexico, quite honestly, and again, the relationship is outstanding with both, outstanding. We just signed our deal, the USMCA, and the relationship is very strong." 
California public schools will likely remain closed for the remainder of the school year to prevent spread of novel coronavirus, Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news conference Tuesday.
Nearly all school districts in the state, with a total student body of 6.1 million students, have been closed in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Sonoma County joined nine other Northern California counties on Tuesday, ordering residents to shelter in place to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus, raising the total number of residents under the orders in the region to nearly 8 million.
“In light of the recent cases of local transmission of COVID-19 in the County, we are taking proactive action to curtail the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Sundari Mase, Sonoma County's interim health officer. 
The air traffic control tower at Chicago Midway International Airport has temporarily closed after several technicians at the facility tested positive for coronavirus, the Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday.

Since January, novel coronavirus has spread to nearly every state and territory
Deaths

Since January, health authorities have identified more than 121,000 Covid-19 cases throughout the United States. So far, 2,054 — about 1.7% — of those patients have died.
Reported cases and deaths
The figures below are based on data from state and county health departments. These numbers are updated every 10 minutes but may differ from other sources due to differences in reporting times. For up-to-the-minute updates, follow our live coverage.

New York has become the epicenter of the country’s outbreak with 52,318 confirmed cases and 728 deaths so far. When adjusted for population, that translates to roughly 269 known cases for every 100,000 residents.
But experts say those numbers don’t give the whole picture because many cases — including mild or asymptomatic infections — have not been diagnosed.
States have also approached testing differently. In New York, where officials have been testing aggressively, the number of known cases is now doubling about every two days. Meanwhile, in California, the number of known cases is doubling about every three days.

A more telling number, according to experts, will be the number of people hospitalized with coronavirus.
Those patients have the most serious infections, and one of the biggest concerns during the pandemic is that hospitals will be overwhelmed, running out of life-saving tools such as ventilators.

A cruise ship that carried a man who died from coronavirus is held off the California coast with 3,500 people on board
Here's how the novel coronavirus outbreak unfolded

That's because the Grand Princess previously carried a passenger who has become the first person to die from coronavirus in California.
And dozens of passengers who were on the voyage with that man are still on the ship. At least two people who traveled with that passenger on the ship tested positive for the virus this week.
The Grand Princess was on a 15-day trip and was scheduled to return Saturday. But the trip was cut short after news broke Wednesday of the California man's death.
The ship is now near the San Francisco coast but must remain at sea as it awaits testing for the virus from test kits delivered by helicopter Thursday.
Test results were expected Friday, said Mary Ellen Carroll, executive director of the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management.
She said 2,383 passengers and 1,100 crew members are aboard the ship. A total of 35 have shown flu-like symptoms during the course of the cruise, though many have recovered and are no longer showing symptoms.
The number of US coronavirus cases soars past 200, with at least 11 deaths
Passenger Sharon Lane said she's worried about the elderly guests on board who may be more vulnerable to coronavirus.
"Public health officials have advised that no guests will be permitted to disembark until all (test) results have been received," Princess Cruises said in a statement.
"While there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 currently on board, the CDC has identified groups of guests and crew who will be tested before arrival into San Francisco," Princess Cruises said in a statement.
"There are fewer than 100 guests and crew identified for testing, including all in-transit guests (guests who were on the previous Mexico voyage and remained onboard for the current Hawaii voyage), those guests and crew who have experienced influenza-like illness symptoms on this voyage, and guests currently under care for respiratory illness."
The unidentified man was 71 and had underlying health conditions, Placer County health officials said.
He was likely exposed to the virus on a Grand Princess cruise from San Francisco to Mexico between February 11 and 21. His death was announced Wednesday.
The two people who tested positive for the virus who were on that cruise are in isolation rooms in a Santa Rosa, California, hospital, the Sonoma County Department of Health Services said Thursday.
The global death toll from coronavirus has topped 3,300
California Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency, saying local health officials are working with their federal counterparts to trace people who had contact with the man who died.
"This emergency proclamation will help the state further prepare our communities and our health care system in the event it spreads more broadly," he said.
Princess Cruises said it has shared relevant travel and health data with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help notify state and county health officials, who will follow up with anyone who may have been exposed to coronavirus.
What actually happens during a coronavirus test?
After the test kits are delivered to the ship by helicopter, a medical team on board will then administer the tests.
The cruise line said federal health officials require anyone from the previous voyage to remain in their rooms until they've been cleared.
"Spirits are as high as can be under the circumstances," she said. "We are blessed to be healthy, comfortable and well-fed."
In the recording Thursday, the captain also discussed CDC recommendations that "all guests practice social distancing, including staying six feet or two meters from other guests."
But another Princess Cruises ship, the Diamond Princess, was the site of a major coronavirus outbreak.
Japanese government adviser: Diamond Princess quarantine was flawed
After the first handful of cases were reported from the Diamond Princess, Japanese officials decided to quarantine the ship. Eventually, more than 700 people on board became infected with coronavirus.
"The problem with the Diamond (Princess) cruise ship, as we've learned, was that when you quarantine people like that, with a few possible infected people, the likelihood of infecting many more people goes up," CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.
"Cruise ships are sort of a reservoir for these viruses, even outside of the coronavirus outbreak."
A top Japanese government adviser has said the quarantine of the Diamond Princess "may not have been perfect."
Dr. Norio Ohmagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center at Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine, said infected crew members may have passed on infections to other crew members or guests.
"Unfortunately to maintain daily life of the more than 3,700 passenger cruise, we needed help, we needed support from cruise members to maintain the daily life," said Yosuke Kita of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
US coronavirus cases and deaths keep rising
A state-by-state breakdown of US coronavirus cases
Health officials are urging local communities to think of ways to stop the coronavirus from spreading as the number of cases soared past 200 nationwide.
That number includes at least 46 former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of a recent coronavirus outbreak and quarantine.
At least 11 people have died from coronavirus across the United States. In addition to the former Grand Princess passenger in California, 10 people have died in Washington state -- including many who are linked to a long-term nursing home near Seattle.

Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed into law a coronavirus relief package that includes provisions for free testing for Covid-19 and paid emergency leave.
The Senate had earlier Wednesday approved the House-passed bill. The move allowed the upper chamber to devote its full attention to passing the next relief package in response to the coronavirus crisis.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans had been critical of the House-passed legislation, but emphasized that it is urgent to get relief to the American people amid the coronavirus crisis.
McConnell reiterated Wednesday that he would not adjourn the Senate until it passed what lawmakers are describing as a "phase three" economic stimulus package in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
To aid in social distancing, McConnell announced ahead of the final vote that senators would take precautions during the vote.
GOP senators close to agreement among themselves on coronavirus stimulus package
He asked members to be aware of "social distancing" as they came over to the chamber and departed it and said, "With that, I think we will be able to get through the voting that will occur in all likelihood later today without violating any of the safety precautions that have been recommended to us by the Capitol Physician and others."
LIVE UPDATES: Coronavirus pandemic changes life as we know it
The revised legislation would still provide many workers with up to two weeks of paid sick leave if they are being tested or treated for coronavirus or have been diagnosed with it. Also eligible would be those who have been told by a doctor or government official to stay home because of exposure or symptoms.
Workers with family members affected by coronavirus and those whose children's schools have closed would still receive up to two-thirds of their pay, though that benefit would now be limited to $200 a day.

(CNN Business)Apple on Friday released a website and an iOS app that allows users to screen themselves for coronavirus symptoms, marking another response to the pandemic by a major tech platform.
Both tools were developed in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the White House's Coronavirus Task Force and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Apple said in a statement to CNN Business. The app and website include a questionnaire and information about the novel coronavirus.
Friday's announcement follows statements by CEO Tim Cook that Apple will be donating 10 million face masks across Europe and the United States.
It also comes on the heels of a nationwide website launched by Google last week to provide users with information about the coronavirus. The website was expected to add links to a CDC screening tool when it became available; a Google spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Coronavirus deaths in Louisiana skyrocket by 40% in one day
Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was sharply restricting travel to the United States from more than two dozen European countries, a drastic step he framed as an attempt to contain a spreading public health crisis that has engulfed his presidency, caused global market turmoil and disrupted everyday life.
The clarifications aside, Trump's grave-sounding remarks from the Oval Office abandoned his rosy portrayals of the global pandemic, choosing instead to frame the outbreak as a "foreign virus" washing on American shores, despite increasing instances of community spread inside the US.
After facing sharp criticism about his response to the virus, Trump insisted he was "marshaling the full power of the federal government" to confront it and announced several steps he said would help blunt its economic impact.
While he sought to strike a unifying note for the country, his attempts to pin blame abroad for the outbreak were unmistakable.
WHO declares novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic
"We have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe," Trump said, stumbling at moments as he read from a teleprompter behind the Resolute Desk. "The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe."
"We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus," Trump said. "We made a life-saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe. We will not delay. I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health and safety of the American people. I will always put the well-being of America first."
Trump's top advisers had discussed potential new travel advisories on Europe during meetings at the White House on Wednesday, according to two officials familiar with the matter. Administration officials view Europe as a new epicenter for the pandemic.
Trump has been searching this week for major steps to demonstrate his capacity to effectively confront the virus, but even some of his allies have questioned how seriously he's taking the crisis.
The primetime address on Wednesday seemed part of a larger White House effort to tamp down on criticism of Trump's apparent nonchalance toward the problem. After saying for days he planned to proceed with his schedule, despite warnings from health officials, the White House announced on Wednesday it was suspending the President's planned travel, including to a political event in Milwaukee later this month.
Earlier Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
There are 118,000 cases globally and more than 4,000 deaths, the agency said, and the virus has found a foothold on every continent except for Antarctica.
The White House is already proposing to Congress certain economic relief measures to help mitigate the coronavirus' economic effect.
In the weeks since the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at all-time highs, the emergence of the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted global supply chains, triggered the cancellation of major conferences and public events and led companies to cancel travel plans and enact emergency work-from-home policies.
These disruptions have led to warnings of slowed economic activity and fears of a global recession, sending markets into a tailspin.

What the government can and can't do during a pandemic
See inside 1,000-bed field hospital in New York
Fear, panic as women navigate pregnancy during a pandemic
Coronavirus deaths in Louisiana skyrocket by 40% in one day
(CNN)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel advisory urging people in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to "refrain from non-essential domestic travel" for the next two weeks.
President Donald Trump had asked the CDC on Saturday to issue the advisory after he had floated the idea of a quarantine earlier in the day.
The CDC said this advisory does not apply to employees of critical infrastructure industries, including but not limited to trucking, public health professionals, financial services, and food supply. These employees of critical infrastructure, as defined by the United States Department of Homeland Security and have a special responsibility to maintain normal work schedules.
Trump said in his tweet that a quarantine would "not be necessary."
Trump had said earlier in the day that he was considering a short-term quarantine of "hot spots" in parts of the tri-state area -- New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- where cases of coronavirus continue to rise.
"We're thinking about certain things. Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it's a hotspot. ... We might not have to do it, but there's a possibility that sometime today we'll do a quarantine, short-term, two weeks on New York. Probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut," he told reporters as he departed the White House for Norfolk Naval Station to send off a Navy hospital ship to New York.
Trump's suggestion comes after the United States this week became the epicenter of the global pandemic, with more than 120,000 reported Covid-19 cases across the country, and more than 52,000 of them in New York state alone. Officials forecast that the apex of the pandemic there is still 14 to 21 days away. But overwhelmed hospitals, in New York as well as across the US, working to treat coronavirus patients and curb the spread of the virus are facing a shortage of supplies and ventilators, a key piece of equipment.

"I don't even know what that means. I don't know how that could be legally enforceable," the Democratic governor said during in a news conference in Albany. "And from a medical point view, I don't know what you would be accomplishing."
Later Saturday, Cuomo told CNN's Ana Cabrera that the quarantine sounded more like a lockdown for the New York area, calling a potential move by the federal government "mayhem."
Trump, however, earlier said that possible quarantine would be "enforceable" and "restrict travel" from those parts of the tri-state area. He also said any quarantine wouldn't affect truckers from outside the New York area.
Trump floated the idea of a quarantine after fielding complaints from Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a person familiar with the conversation told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. DeSantis repeated in that conversation the complaints he has made publicly that too many people were leaving New York and possibly spreading coronavirus in his state, the source said.
The Forida governor had mandated a 14-day self-quarantine or isolation period for travelers coming to Florida from airports in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. According to media reports, wealthy New Yorkers have fled Manhattan for vacation homes in the Hamptons, the Catskills, the Poconos, Florida and Connecticut.
DeSantis said he had a call with Trump about coronavirus tests and that the President mentioned the possibility of a quarantine "around the New York City area."
INTERACTIVE: Tracking coronavirus' global spread
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, responded to Trump's tweet with one of his own, saying that the possible quarantine measures are "unclear" and could cause "confusion."
The specifics & impact of this new directive by tweet are unclear & uncertain. The effect may be more confusion than confidence. Gov. Lamont has been strong & effective in his leadership instructing CT's people to self-quarantine & stay at home if possible," Blumenthal said in a Saturday Twitter post.
As he departed from Joint Base Andrews, Trump said he would speak to Cuomo later about the possible quarantine. And describing the quarantine as something that would be "for a short period of time, if we do it at all," the President also said that he would not close the New York City subway.
Earlier this month, Cuomo had deployed the National Guard and created a 1-mile "containment zone" in New Rochelle, a suburb of New York City, in an attempt to stop a growing cluster of coronavirus cases.
The National Guard helped coordinate delivering meals to those in quarantine and a drive-thru coronavirus testing site was opened.
Cuomo said that the number of new coronavirus cases slowed over the period the restrictions were imposed.
As of Saturday morning, New York had at least 728 reported deaths due to coronavirus and at least 52,318 reported cases -- making it the state with the most in the nation, according to CNN Health's tally.
The legislation, passed in the 1950s on the cusp of the Korean War, provides the President with a broad set of federal powers to require businesses to "prioritize and accept government contracts" as well as "provide economic incentives" to ensure the US has the stockpiles it needs to handle an impending medical crisis.
The Navy hospital ship will not treat patients with coronavirus, but rather provide surge capacity for those with other urgent care needs.
Each ship contains 12 fully equipped operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, radiology services, a medical lab, pharmacy, optometry lab, a CAT-scan and two oxygen producing plants, according to the Navy.

(CNN)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel advisory urging people in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to "refrain from non-essential domestic travel" for the next two weeks.
President Donald Trump had asked the CDC on Saturday to issue the advisory after he had floated the idea of a quarantine earlier in the day.
The CDC said this advisory does not apply to employees of critical infrastructure industries, including but not limited to trucking, public health professionals, financial services, and food supply. These employees of critical infrastructure, as defined by the United States Department of Homeland Security and have a special responsibility to maintain normal work schedules.
Trump said in his tweet that a quarantine would "not be necessary."
Trump had said earlier in the day that he was considering a short-term quarantine of "hot spots" in parts of the tri-state area -- New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- where cases of coronavirus continue to rise.
"We're thinking about certain things. Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it's a hotspot. ... We might not have to do it, but there's a possibility that sometime today we'll do a quarantine, short-term, two weeks on New York. Probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut," he told reporters as he departed the White House for Norfolk Naval Station to send off a Navy hospital ship to New York.
Trump's suggestion comes after the United States this week became the epicenter of the global pandemic, with more than 120,000 reported Covid-19 cases across the country, and more than 52,000 of them in New York state alone. Officials forecast that the apex of the pandemic there is still 14 to 21 days away. But overwhelmed hospitals, in New York as well as across the US, working to treat coronavirus patients and curb the spread of the virus are facing a shortage of supplies and ventilators, a key piece of equipment.

"I don't even know what that means. I don't know how that could be legally enforceable," the Democratic governor said during in a news conference in Albany. "And from a medical point view, I don't know what you would be accomplishing."
Later Saturday, Cuomo told CNN's Ana Cabrera that the quarantine sounded more like a lockdown for the New York area, calling a potential move by the federal government "mayhem."
Trump, however, earlier said that possible quarantine would be "enforceable" and "restrict travel" from those parts of the tri-state area. He also said any quarantine wouldn't affect truckers from outside the New York area.
Trump floated the idea of a quarantine after fielding complaints from Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a person familiar with the conversation told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. DeSantis repeated in that conversation the complaints he has made publicly that too many people were leaving New York and possibly spreading coronavirus in his state, the source said.
The Forida governor had mandated a 14-day self-quarantine or isolation period for travelers coming to Florida from airports in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. According to media reports, wealthy New Yorkers have fled Manhattan for vacation homes in the Hamptons, the Catskills, the Poconos, Florida and Connecticut.
DeSantis said he had a call with Trump about coronavirus tests and that the President mentioned the possibility of a quarantine "around the New York City area."
INTERACTIVE: Tracking coronavirus' global spread
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, responded to Trump's tweet with one of his own, saying that the possible quarantine measures are "unclear" and could cause "confusion."
The specifics & impact of this new directive by tweet are unclear & uncertain. The effect may be more confusion than confidence. Gov. Lamont has been strong & effective in his leadership instructing CT's people to self-quarantine & stay at home if possible," Blumenthal said in a Saturday Twitter post.
As he departed from Joint Base Andrews, Trump said he would speak to Cuomo later about the possible quarantine. And describing the quarantine as something that would be "for a short period of time, if we do it at all," the President also said that he would not close the New York City subway.
Earlier this month, Cuomo had deployed the National Guard and created a 1-mile "containment zone" in New Rochelle, a suburb of New York City, in an attempt to stop a growing cluster of coronavirus cases.
The National Guard helped coordinate delivering meals to those in quarantine and a drive-thru coronavirus testing site was opened.
Cuomo said that the number of new coronavirus cases slowed over the period the restrictions were imposed.
As of Saturday morning, New York had at least 728 reported deaths due to coronavirus and at least 52,318 reported cases -- making it the state with the most in the nation, according to CNN Health's tally.
The legislation, passed in the 1950s on the cusp of the Korean War, provides the President with a broad set of federal powers to require businesses to "prioritize and accept government contracts" as well as "provide economic incentives" to ensure the US has the stockpiles it needs to handle an impending medical crisis.
The Navy hospital ship will not treat patients with coronavirus, but rather provide surge capacity for those with other urgent care needs.
Each ship contains 12 fully equipped operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, radiology services, a medical lab, pharmacy, optometry lab, a CAT-scan and two oxygen producing plants, according to the Navy.

The EU shuts its borders to slow the coronavirus crisis
Brits blame their government as coronavirus fears rise 03:07
(CNN)The European Union has formally agreed to temporarily close its external borders to all "non-essential" travel from third nations, as the bloc hopes to put out internal political fires that the coronavirus outbreak has lit across the continent.
With immediate effect, the only things permitted to cross into the bloc will be goods, medical equipment and in some cases people deemed to be necessary to the EU's efforts to manage the coronavirus spread. The measures will remain in place for 30 days and will not apply to the United Kingdom, which despite having left the EU earlier this year is still in a transition period with the bloc.

The agreement is not legally binding and will rely on leaders sticking to the commitments made in an emergency conference call on Tuesday. "It's up to them now to implement ... They said they would immediately do that," said European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen shortly after the agreement was reached.
The move comes after the European outbreak of the virus created political tensions among member states that placed enormous pressure on Brussels to act, despite the EU's central bodies having little formal authority over nation's health or border policies.

Fear, panic as women navigate pregnancy during a pandemic
Coronavirus deaths in Louisiana skyrocket by 40% in one day
(CNN)President Donald Trump says he's pushed the Food and Drug Administration to eliminate barriers to getting therapeutics for coronavirus to patients.
He said a drug currently used as an antimalarial -- hydroxychloroquine -- would be made available almost immediately to treat coronavirus.
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn carefully tempered the President's remarks regarding his team's work to develop treatments for coronavirus.
How Trump's rhetoric has changed as coronavirus spread
He also explained the process of convalescent plasma, which has to do with isolating blood from those who have survived the coronavirus and have the right immunoglobulins. A concentration of that could treat people infected with the virus.
He also said there is a vaccine trial currently being performed that is expected to take "12 months."
Early evidence from human cells suggests that chloroquine -- which is used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases -- may have some activity against the novel coronavirus. Doctors in China, the US and other countries have used the drug experimentally in Covid-19 patients, but there is not yet sufficient clinical evidence that it's effective in humans.
When asked about chloroquine last month, Dr. Janet Diaz of the World Health Organization said "there is no proof that that is an effective treatment at this time. We recommend that therapeutics be tested under ethically approved clinical trials to show efficacy and safety."
Following Trump's announcement on Thursday, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said it was important to "exert a little bit of caution" when hearing about the drugs being looked at to treat coronavirus.

Texas governor mandates self-quarantine for travelers from New York tri-state area and New Orleans
Washington (CNN)Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday he is mandating a 14-day self-quarantine for anyone traveling to his state from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and the city of New Orleans.
The executive order -- which marks just the latest clampdown on domestic travel amid the novel coronavirus pandemic -- applies only to those who arrive in Texas by plane and will be enforced by the Texas Department of Public Safety.
Speaking at a news conference Thursday, Abbott said the move is "intended simply to achieve the goals" circulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House to slow the outbreak.
Travelers from the designated areas will be asked to provide officials with quarantine locations, Abbott said adding that the Texas Department of Public Safety will visits the designated locations to verify compliance.
The governor said those under order cannot have any visitors besides health care providers and that failure to comply will be considered a criminal offense punishable by up to a $1,000 fine, 180 days in jail or both.
His order reflects a growing concern among state leaders about travelers coming from the New York tri-state area, and more recently New Orleans, where the outbreak has surged.
"This is unusual," Raimondo said of the plan to execute the mandate. "This is radical." She said the state has added 33 cases of the virus since Wednesday, bringing its total to 165.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a similar executive order earlier this week mandating a 14-day self-quarantine or isolation period for travelers coming to Florida from airports in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Explaining the move at a news conference Monday, DeSantis, a Republican, said, "Today there's over 190 direct flights from the New York City area to the state of Florida, and I would reckon, given the outbreak there, that every single flight has somebody on it who's positive for Covid-19."
Earlier this week, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, urged anyone who has recently left New York to self-quarantine for 14 days in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.

New CDC guidance says older adults should 'stay at home as much as possible' due to coronavirus

Coronavirus deaths in Louisiana skyrocket by 40% in one day
(CNN)Amid a coronavirus outbreak in the United States, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is encouraging older people and people with severe chronic medical conditions to "stay at home as much as possible."
Early data suggests older people are twice as likely to have serious illness from the novel coronavirus, according to the CDC.
A Trump administration official tells CNN that the US Department of Health and Human Services "is in the process of doing targeted outreach to the elderly community and those that have serious underlying health conditions."
I live in Kirkland, epicenter of the US outbreak. We need Trump to take this seriously
The CDC guidance comes as two top infectious disease experts with ties to the federal government have advised people over 60 and those with underlying health problems to strongly consider avoiding activities that involve large crowds.
"This ought to be top of mind for people over 60, and those with underlying health problems, such as heart or lung disease, diabetes, or compromised immune systems," Schaffner added. "The single most important thing you can do to avoid the virus is reduce your face to face contact with people."
Key things we've learned this week as the deadly coronavirus outbreak grows in the US
"I think clearly the time has come to take these steps," said Osterholm, who has served on committees advising the federal government on public health issues and is director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
If coronavirus spreads within the US, here's how daily life might change
"It's always been easy to be abstract when you're a public health person when something's happening in Africa or Asia or the Arabian peninsula," he said. "But now it's happening here, and we have to internalize this."
Schaffner and Osterholm said data from China shows that elderly people and those with underlying health issues are most at risk of becoming seriously ill and of dying from the novel coronavirus. Younger and healthier people often get only mild to moderate symptoms, or sometimes no symptoms at all.

Coronavirus deaths in the US could reach peak in three weeks, epidemiologist says
CDC releases illustration of the Coronavirus.
(CNN)A leading epidemiologist advising the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated the peak of deaths in the US coronavirus pandemic will be three weeks from now, after which "most of the damage will be done," and says it may be possible to only isolate the vulnerable, allowing many back to work.
The CDC confirmed that Ira Longini, professor at the Center for Statistics and Quantitative Infectious Diseases at the University of Florida, is a "funded partner." The agency said he works with them on Covid-19 modeling.
Your coronavirus questions answered
Modeling is not precise, and uses known data to project trends in disease spread, and there were dissenting opinions expressed to CNN about Longini's analysis. Yet two other disease experts broadly agreed with the estimate.
Trump says he wants the country 'opened up and just raring to go by Easter,' despite health experts' warnings
Longini's suggestion that US deaths could peak in less than a month will have two possible impacts. First, a sudden surge in deaths risks overwhelming health care systems that are currently struggling to prepare for cases needing intensive care. Secondly and conversely, it could support calls -- echoed by President Trump -- to reduce restrictions on movement in the coming weeks.
Longini said: "I would guess the US will hit a peak in deaths in the next two-three weeks, as the doubling time seems to be about two-three days." He added: "Maybe a partial lifting of the shelter-in-place for those less vulnerable may make some sense, in about three weeks. By then, much of the damage will have been done."
Asked if there could be a risk of a relapse when the virus circulated again in the following weeks, he said: "If it were limited, and we continued to protect the most vulnerable, that may be acceptable for now. Also, let's see what happens in the next two-three weeks. We can also keep an eye on China as they begin to relax restrictions there."
The two other experts who broadly agreed with Longini offered slight variations on his projection, and both noted that the outbreaks are hitting each US community in a different way.
These are the faces of some of the US coronavirus victims
Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said the peak might take three more weeks.
"My notions are harmonious in that I also anticipate ... (the next) three to six weeks will be critical here in the United States," he said. He added it might take six weeks as the US is a "very diverse country with a hot spot in New York right now and warm spots. The rest of the country is warming up. In the next three to six weeks, all those areas will start to surge or will have their curve depressed or blunted by the social distancing that's going on. The virus will tell us."
A second expert agreed broadly. Dr. Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said by email: "I agree that by 3 weeks, we will have a better idea of what is going to happen going forward. The outbreaks seem to be hitting different communities at different times and at different intensities, so it is hard to generalize However, I agree in general. And that is why action now in terms of social distancing is so important."
Epidemiology has informed US, UK and other government policy as it provides informed guesses as to where and how fast infections are spreading. A recent sharpening of US and UK restrictions was, for example, based on modeling from the UK's Imperial College, which significantly worsened its prediction of how many people would require intensive care in hospital, using data from Italy.
One disease modeler said it was "impossible to predict" when the peak would hit.
Dr. Stefan Flasche, a disease modeler at The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told CNN by email the peak was influenced by the efficiency of lockdown measures, and "may be anywhere between some time very soon and not for another few months."
"One scenario is we can indeed reverse the spread as done in China and South Korea, then reach a point to lift the distancing measures," Flasche said. "But (we may) have to repeat this cycle for a few times because of an inevitable resurgence of cases in the absence of population immunity. In that scenario, we would see multiple peaks in the upcoming 12 months."
She cautioned that it's hard to put a price on the uncertainty -- and deaths -- that might occur were the government to begin loosening restrictions. "Markets, investors, and economies don't do well in the context of panic and uncertainty," she said. "The people that are going to be dying from coronavirus are going to be very visible. We are going to know exactly who those people are. That changes the discussion a lot."

(CNN) — With many people facing weeks largely confined to their homes in densely populated cities because of the coronavirus, it's understandable that some have considered heading to wilder, more remote places in pursuit of freedom and fresh air.
But as recreational vehicles and other traffic have flooded into some of these rural destinations, those living there have reacted with alarm -- urging people to stay away to avoid bringing infection and overwhelming limited health provisions.
"Please don't use the Highlands as your means of self-isolation," tweeted Kate Forbes, Scotland's finance secretary and the Highlands representative in Scotland's parliament.
If you live elsewhere, please don’t use the Highlands as your means of self-isolation. People live here who are trying to follow government guidance and the continuing flow of campervans and other traffic who appear to be escaping the cities is not helping. 
Coronavirus fears
There have been 416 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Scotland. Only eight of these are the Highlands, and the region hopes to keep it that way.
Scotland's islands are particularly concerned about the impact of the virus on their small communities.
Angus MacNeil, a politician who lives on the Island of Barra, part of the Outer Hebrides off Scotland's west coast, posted a sobering image on Twitter of Castlebay village hall, kitted out with basic hospital beds. He added that there were no ventilators on the islands.

Here's how the novel coronavirus outbreak unfolded
(CNN) — Countries around the world have imposed sweeping travel bans and advisories to stem the spread of coronavirus within their borders and beyond.
Last week, the United States limited nonessential travel across its borders with Mexico and Canada and raised its global travel warning for Americans to the highest level, advising citizens to avoid all international travel.
Here's everything you need to know about social distancing
The increased restrictions follow the United States' Europe travel ban, announced on March 11, that bars US entry to foreign nationals who have visited much of Europe in the previous 14 days.
Flights have been drastically reduced and widespread closures of public areas are in effect. Italy, France and Spain are under lockdown, and the residents of several US states, including California and New York, are under stay-at-home orders.
Airbnb further expands its coronavirus response, hosts complain, Vrbo makes no change
The US State Department's global travel advisory is at its highest level -- Level 4: Do Not Travel. Americans are advised to avoid all international travel.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has its own list of travel advisories posted online. The CDC has advised older adults and other higher-risk groups to "stay home as much as possible."
Virus creates world's longest passenger flight
In addition to the United States' Europe travel ban, the restricted US-Canada and US-Mexico borders and restrictions imposed by the US on arrivals from Iran and China, the European Union has closed its external borders for 30 days.
Coronavirus: Which countries have travel bans?
Delta is among the many airlines that have slashed service globally.
Airlines have scrambled to adapt operations to travel bans and a staggering drop in global demand.
Delta Air Lines also has a hub of information online related to the impacts of coronavirus, including details on change-fee waivers good for travel in March or April and for tickets booked in March.
Globally, airlines have slashed flights amid the outbreak, with many suspending service to hard-hit countries such as China and Italy. They've also slashed domestic service and other routes following a precipitous drop in air travel.
Airlines have bumped up their sanitation efforts to stem the virus' spread, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has posted guidance on aircraft cleaning.
Delta Air Lines started using a fogging technique in February "with a highly effective, EPA-registered disinfectant" on flights arriving in the United States from Asia and has expanded that procedure more widely.
While disinfecting is helpful, frequent hand washing is among a traveler's best defenses, infectious disease experts say.
"Even if there is virus in the inanimate environment, it's not going to jump off the seat and bite you in the ankle," says Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in Vanderbilt University's division of infectious diseases.
The CDC advises washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can be used when soap and water are not available.
If you are sick, wearing a face mask when you are around other people can be helpful, according to the CDC. But those who are symptomatic should avoid travel.
Golden Princess was anchored off New Zealand on Sunday. Some passengers were undergoing health testing.
Princess Cruises has suspended global operations from March 12 to May 10, and Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and Carnival have suspended outbound cruises for about a month.
"US citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship," the warning reads.

Coronavirus: Is it okay to go outside?
With so much uncertainty still around the pandemic and the world's ability to curb the virus' spread, there's no clear cut answer to these questions.
With international borders snapping shut, airlines grounding thousands of flights around the globe and health officials everywhere pleading for people to stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19, traveling anywhere beyond your local grocery store may have serious repercussions.
Travel and the coronavirus pandemic: Everything you need to know
The Happiest Place on Earth, Disneyland, has closed its properties until at least the end of March. The organization has automatically canceled and refunded reservations until then. As for April and beyond, Disney websites say only they are "in regular contact with appropriate officials and health experts."
The US Department of State advises simply: "do not travel" and refers people to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for more information.
"Different countries can be in different phases of the pandemic at any point in time and different parts of the same country can also be in different phases of a pandemic," the CDC writes.
As the border between Canada and the United States closes to all but essential traffic this week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said travel restrictions and other measures to slow the pandemic could continue for "weeks to months."
Trudeau made the comments from the front step of his house in Ottawa on Thursday, where he and his family are in self-isolation after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for COVID-19 after returning from the UK.
But some public health researchers are suggesting travel restrictions will last much longer than a few months.
The decision about whether you can safely venture out of the house, never mind the country, will come when we've managed to "stamp out transmission" of COVID-19, says Kumi Smith, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota.
"The predictive mathematical models are being built, and the whole point of that is to try to give lawmakers, authorities and public health officials some grasp of what's going on. But as new cases come in, that new data is being fed into the models; it's updated every day."
The models change depending on how the public responds to the restrictions: The less we go to the beach and the more we follow advice to wash our hands frequently, cough and sneeze into our elbows and practice social distancing, the better those mathematical models will look.
Airbnb is expanding its coronavirus response
"When it comes to 'When will this all end and when can I travel again'?" I would push that question back," says Smith. "I'd say it's on us to adhere to these regulations and to quarantine ourselves and monitor ourselves and try to do what we can as individuals to stop this from spreading."

Coronavirus-hit cruise ship in diplomatic scramble to find somewhere to dock
(CNN) — A transatlantic cruise ship carrying more than 600 passengers with at least five confirmed coronavirus cases on board has spent days searching for somewhere to dock after it was refused entry at multiple Caribbean ports.
British officials launched an intense diplomatic effort to find a country willing to take the MS Braemar, which belongs to the British company Fred Olsen Cruise Lines. Twenty passengers and another 20 crew members, including a doctor, are in isolation after displaying influenza-like symptoms while traveling on the ship.
Cuba said it would allow the ship to dock there out of "humanitarian concerns" and the need for "a shared effort to confront and stop the spread of the pandemic."
It is not yet clear when the ship may arrive in Cuba and where the infected passengers will be treated if the British government decides to send the ship to dock there.
"No other Caribbean ports were willing to accept the ship because of local sensitivities towards COVID-19 coronavirus," the company said in a statement.
A plan to allow the ship to sail back to the UK was ruled out on practical grounds due to the distance involved and the health of the passengers.

Passengers have been advised to self-isolate and contact the ship's medical center if they felt unwell. The ship's bars and restaurants remain open. The UK's Foreign & Commonwealth Office wrote to all British nationals on board on Saturday, advising them to follow the cruise firm's guidance. Two officials are in Freeport offering support to the Bahamian authorities.
"We are working intensively with Fred Olsen Cruise Lines and the authorities in the region to urgently make arrangements to get British nationals safely home," the FCO told CNN in a statement. "The ship is being resupplied in the Bahamas. We are ensuring medical supplies are available -- including by funding resupply by helicopter."
The cruise line was unable to drop passengers on its Caribbean cruise in La Romana in the Dominican Republic on February 27 after a number of influenza-like cases on board were reported.
On Monday, March 9, the company reported that two people who had been on the Braemar were diagnosed with the coronavirus after returning home. Six people reporting flu-like symptoms on the ship were tested, and five cases were confirmed on Wednesday -- four crew and one passenger -- with another inconclusive result.
Deer said the company had "acted on the best advice available" when it boarded passengers in St Maarten on March 2. "No one who joined the ship declared illness, and no passenger had traveled to a high-risk area nor been exposed to anyone with COVID-19 coronavirus.
"Anyone remaining on the ship had been in the Caribbean for at least 14 days and there had been no known instances of the virus in the region."
"The Government of The Bahamas reaffirms its continued commitment to take action in the best interest of the public health and safety and well-being of the Bahamian people and residents of The Bahamas.
"Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people who have contracted the coronavirus and who are at immediate risk."

Mayor Bowser Highlights the District’s Coronavirus Testing Capacity
(Washington, DC) – Today, Mayor Muriel Bowser and the District Department of Health (DC Health) published information for residents on getting tested for the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the District, including new locations for drive-thru and walk-up testing by hospitals and health providers.
This information and other updates on the District’s response to COVID-19 are available at coronavirus.dc.gov.
COVID-19 Testing
Doctors decide on COVID-19 testing. If an individual is experiencing symptoms including cough, fever, and shortness of breath, they should consult their doctor before visiting. If their doctor decides that a COVID-19 test is warranted, the doctor has the ability to swab the appropriate areas and send the swabs to a private lab for testing or to work with DC Health to send it to the District’s Public Health Lab. The private lab will share results with the doctor who will share the results with the individual. The private lab will also alert DC Health of all COVID-19 test results, regardless of whether the test is positive or negative.
If any medical providers need assistance with testing, they are encouraged to reach out to DC Health.
COVID-19 Specimen Submission Guidelines
The District has identified three priority groups for testing, which are aligned with those identified by the US Public Health Service (USPHS):
Hospitalized patients and healthcare facility workers with COVID-19 symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. This ensures optimal care options for all hospitalized patients, lessens the risk of healthcare-associated infections, and maintains the integrity of the US healthcare system. Many of the patients in this group are currently receiving testing within hospitals and through their health systems’ occupational health programs.
Patients in long-term care facilities with symptoms; patients over the age of 65 with symptoms; patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease who also have symptoms; and first responders with symptoms. This priority ensures those at highest risk of complication of infection are rapidly identified and appropriately triaged.
Critical infrastructure workers with symptoms; individuals who do not meet any of the above categories but have symptoms; healthcare facility workers and first responders; and individuals in detention centers and individuals experiencing homelessness with symptoms. This priority will allow us to test individuals, decrease community spread, and ensure the health of essential workers.
Children’s National Health System
To reduce the number of visits by families to emergency departments for COVID-19 testing, Children’s National Health System opened a drive-thru/walk-up location where primary care doctors in the region can refer young patients for COVID-19 specimen collection and testing. The site location, donated by Trinity Washington University in Northwest DC, can safely test children and young adults through 22 years of age who have been identified by their pediatrician or other primary care doctor as having symptoms of COVID-19. The specimens are collected and sent offsite to the program’s laboratory partner, Quest Diagnostics, for testing.
Yes. Community pediatricians and other primary care doctors use their clinical judgement to determine who they refer to the drive-thru/walk-up location. They may choose to refer patients who are either at an increased risk for developing severe symptoms due to the child’s underlying medical condition or because the child has an immediate family member who is in a high-risk category. All referred patients receive the necessary paperwork and directions to access the drive-through and walk-up site from their referring physician. When arriving at the site, photo identification and the referral form are required to enter. All results are communicated back to the family by the referring doctor within three to five days.
Kaiser Permanente has established a walk-up/drive-thru COVID-19 testing site in Washington, DC near their Capitol Hill Medical Center, which is located at 700 2nd Street, NE. They also have five (5) additional drive-up clinics in the mid-Atlantic region.
George Washington Hospital
The George Washington University Hospital plans to offer a drive-thru testing system that will focus on the symptomatic community requiring non-emergent testing. The hours for this testing site will be 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Additionally, they plan to coordinate another drive-thru in the East End in the coming weeks.
The District of Columbia Government will be launching a drive-thru testing site on the campus of United Medical Center in the coming weeks.
The leadership of United Medical Center has offered the use of substantial space on their campus that can be used without disruption to their operations and patient care, including emergency services. District government will partner with a local health system to provide the clinical support. The DC Government will provide testing through the District’s Public Health Lab.
Medstar Health
The MedStar Health e-Visit is a faster, easier way to see a medical provider for basic express care needs. The service is a virtual/video visit with a medical provider offering consultation, diagnosis, treatment, and even prescriptions when appropriate. MedStar e-Visit is available 24/7 and is open to anyone in the MedStar service area which includes Washington, DC. This service can be accessed via the MedStar e-Visit app on a smartphone or tablet, or on a PC by going directly to MedStarhealth.org/eVisit. You do NOT need to be a MedStar Health patient to access an e-Visit provider. In other words, this platform is open to residents of the District of Columbia. Based on the outcomes of the e-Visit, patients may be referred for COVID-19 testing from an e-Visit provider to one of MedStar Health’s testing sites with a physician’s order.
MedStar Health also has two urgent care facilities in the District of Columbia: one on Capitol Hill and one in Adams Morgan. Both facilities are open seven (7) days a week from 8am-8pm and offer testing for COVID-19 if indicated with a doctor’s order. MedStar also has 12 additional urgent care centers in the Washington, DC/Baltimore areas.

(Washington, DC) – Today, to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), Mayor Muriel Bowser issued Mayor’s Order 2020-053: Closure of Non-Essential Businesses and Prohibition on Large Gatherings During Public Health Emergency for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This Mayor’s Order requires temporary closure of the on-site operation of all non-essential businesses and prohibits gatherings of 10 or more people.
The intent of the Order is to temporarily cease all non-essential business activities, including tour guides and touring services; gyms, health clubs, spas, and massage establishments; theaters, auditoriums, and other places of large gatherings; nightclubs; hair, nail, and tanning salons and barbershops; tattoo parlors; sales not involved in essential services; retail clothing stores; and professional services not devoted to assisting essential business operations.
For more information on the District’s response, visit coronavirus.dc.gov.
SUBJECT: Closure of Non-Essential Businesses and Prohibition on Large Gatherings During Public Health Emergency for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
By virtue of the authority vested in me as Mayor of the District of Columbia pursuant to section 422 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved December 24, 1973, Pub. L. 93-198, 87 Stat. 790, D.C. Official Code § 1-204.22 (2016 Repl.); in accordance with the COVID-19 Response Emergency Amendment Act of 2020, effective March 17, 2020, D.C. Act 23-247, and any substantially similar subsequent emergency or temporary legislation; section 5 of the District of Columbia Public Emergency Act of 1980, effective March 5, 1981, D.C. Law 3-149, D.C. Official Code § 7-2304 (2018 Repl.); section 5a of the District of Columbia Public Emergency Act of 1980, effective October 17, 2002, D.C. Law 14-194, D.C. Official Code § 7-2304.01 (2018 Repl.); and section 1 of An Act To Authorize the Commissioners of the District of Columbia to make regulations to prevent and control the spread of communicable and preventable diseases, approved August 11, 1939, 53 Stat. 1408, D.C. Official Code §§ 7-131 et seq. (2012 Repl.), it is hereby ORDERED that:
1. This Order is issued based on the increasing number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Washington, DC, and throughout the metropolitan Washington region. Scientific evidence and public health practices show that the most effective approach to slowing the community transmission of communicable diseases like COVID-19 is through limiting public activities and engaging in social distancing. The age and health of a significant portion of the population of Washington, DC places thousands of residents at risk for serious health complications, including death, from COVID-19.
2. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, Mayor’s Order 2020-045, dated March 11, 2020, and Mayor’s Order 2020-046, dated March 11, 2020 declared a public emergency and public health emergency. Mayor’s Order 2020-050, dated March 20, 2020, extended those declarations of a public emergency and public health emergency through April 24, 2020. Mayor’s Order 2020-048, dated March 16, 2020, Mayor’s Order 2020-051, dated March 20, 2020, and several directives from the Department of Health provided for additional steps required to protect public health. In addition, the President declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020, and the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Further, the COVID-19 Emergency Response Amendment Act of 2020 (D.C. Act 23-247), which was approved by the Council and the Mayor on March 17, 2020, provides the District government with additional tools to address COVID-19.
3. Medical and public health experts agree that COVID-19 is easily transmitted and it is essential that its spread be slowed to protect the ability of public and private health care providers to handle the expected influx of ill patients and safeguard public health and safety.
4. In epidemiology, the concept of slowing a virus’s spread so that fewer people need to seek treatment at any given time is known as “flattening the curve.” The faster and the more sharply the infection curve rises, the more quickly Washington, DC’s health care system will be stressed, to the point that it may become overloaded beyond its capacity to treat severely sick patients. “Flattening the curve” is not expected to greatly reduce the total number of people that will become infected with COVID-19, but those infections will take place over a longer period of time, which will result in a less stressed health care system, and in turn, better patient outcomes.
5. The latest medical findings suggest that some individuals who contract COVID-19 virus have no symptoms or only mild cold-like symptoms, which means they may not be aware they carry the virus. Their interactions with others allow the disease to spread and infect a larger number of people.
6. One proven way to slow the transmission of COVID-19 is to limit interactions among people to the greatest extent practicable by limiting public activity.
7. Because of the risk of the rapid spread of the virus, and the need to protect all members of Washington, DC, and the region, especially residents most vulnerable to the virus, and local health care providers and emergency first responders, this Order requires the temporary closure of the on-site operation of all non-essential businesses and implements a prohibition on large gatherings.
8. This Order is based on guidance from Department of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Memorandum on Identification of Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers During COVID-19 Response, March 19, 2020 for additional detail (available at: https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce).
For clarity: Non-essential businesses include: tour guides and touring services; gyms, health clubs, spas, and massage establishments; theaters, auditoriums, and other places of large gatherings; nightclubs; hair, nail, and tanning salons and barbershops; tattoo parlors; sales not involved in essential services; retail clothing stores; and professional services not devoted to assisting essential business operations.
c. Significantly slow the spread of COVID-19;
d. Reduce COVID-19 virus infections, COVID-19 illness, and death caused by COVID-19 and its complications; and
e. Protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Washington, DC, other individuals located in Washington, DC, and those who ordinarily work here.
For clarity: Businesses, including non-Essential Businesses, may continue telework operations consisting of employees or contractors performing work at their own residences (i.e., working from home) and home-based businesses may continue to operate, to the extent such businesses do not involve individuals making physical contact with other persons and can be carried out in compliance with the Social Distancing Requirements, as defined in section IV.5 of this Order.
3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Order, an individual who is suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 or any other transmissible infectious disease or who has symptoms of a cold or influenza (“the flu”) may not be engaged in conducting Essential Business.
2. To the greatest extent feasible, Essential Businesses that remain open shall comply with Social Distancing Requirements as defined in section IV.5 of this Order, including by separating staff by off-setting shift hours or days and maintaining a separation of at least six (6) feet among and between employees and members of the public, including when any customers, clients, or patients are standing in line or sitting in a waiting room, to the maximum extent possible, separating shifts.
a. Healthcare and Public Health Operations:
i. For the purposes of this Order, the term “Healthcare and Public Health Operations” includes hospitals, clinics, dentists, pharmacies, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, other health care facilities, health care suppliers, home health care and assisted living services, mental health providers, medical marijuana dispensaries, calibrators and operators of medical equipment, or any related and/or ancillary health care services as defined by CISA; and
ii. The term “Healthcare and Public Health Operations” also includes veterinary care and all health care services provided to animals; and
iii. This authorization shall be construed broadly to avoid any impediments to the delivery of health care, broadly defined;
c. Food and Household Products and Services, including grocery stores, supermarkets, licensed farmers’ markets, food banks, convenience stores, liquor stores, and other establishments engaged in the retail sale, wholesale supply or distribution of food products, alcohol, any other household consumer products (such as cleaning and personal care products), laundromats, dry cleaners, laundry service providers, and medical marijuana cultivation centers. This includes stores that sell groceries and also sell other non-grocery products, and stores that sell products necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation, and operation of residences;
ii. Modifying facilities to provide support for addressing COVID-19 or providing support for efforts to address the public emergency and public health emergency declared by the Mayor;
ii. Childcare facilities shall comply with OSSE, Guidance for Child Care Providers and Families Related to Coronavirus (COVID-19);
2. “Essential Government Functions” include first responders, including police, firefighting, and emergency medical services, emergency management, 911/311 call center; law enforcement functions; services needed to ensure the continuing operation of government agencies and provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public performed by the District of Columbia or federal government or their contractors, the District of Columbia Courts, and inter-governmental commissions and entities performing such functions, including judicial and elections functions. The DC Courts should determine what services are needed to continue its essential services.
c. The minimum necessary activities to facilitate teleworking or the remote delivery of services formerly provided in-person by the business; to provide cleaning and disinfection of a business’s facilities; and to provide employee supervision of contractors or employees providing essential maintenance of the facility.
5. “Social Distancing Requirements” include:
b. Washing hands with soap and water for at least twenty (20) seconds or using hand sanitizer frequently, or after contact with potentially-infected surfaces, to the greatest extent feasible;
The Mayor may grant a waiver to a business or nonprofit through the District of Columbia Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency
Q: I work in health care or for a health care-related entity, would my business be considered essential?  
Q. Are home health care aides and direct service providers essential? 
No, but large gatherings of ten or more people are prohibited, so as a practical matter, most churches are not holding services. Weddings and funerals may only be 10 or fewer people.  Houses of worship can maintain basic business operations, and many open their doors to people who walk in who want a quiet place to pray alone. Many congregations are also maintaining their social service programs to deliver essential items like food to people who are at home or helping others get to medical appointments.   
A: No. Construction is allowed under Section IV.1.j. However, it should be conducted safely with social distancing prioritized. 
Q: Medical personnel refer clients to my Pilates studio. Can we continue to stay open and provide services as essential medical services?  
A: If you are not a licensed medical practitioner, then your studio is considered a gym, which is non-essential and must close. 
A: No. We encourage people to do essential exercise, but it’s much safer to do so alone. If you do have an allowable number of clients and they are practicing social distancing, it is best if payment is made online, so you’re not handing items like credit cards back and forth.   
Q: I operate a beauty supply store.  Some of our supplies include alcohol, hand wipes, and surgical masks.  Can we stay open?

Thanks to our tireless agency, nonprofit, and local business partners, there are a range of services for DC residents who need food resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have created a map of these resources that will be updated each evening.
If you have food at home, please stay home. DC Health is prioritizing social distancing and self-quarantine to limit the spread and impact of the coronavirus. Those who have food and other resources at home should use those resources first and maintain social distancing.
We encourage you to continue purchasing food at farmers markets located in the District of Columbia. Farmers markets are essential food sources for residents in all eight Wards, and continue to operate throughout the District. Vendors and their employees are taking precautions to limit the spread of infections like regularly washing their hands, cleaning facilities and vendor areas more frequently, and reducing close contact with each other. They are also taking steps to ensure customers have a safe shopping environment. These steps include providing hand sanitizer; frequently disinfecting surfaces; and suspending the offering of samples. Farmers markets are a great way to support local farmers in this period of economic uncertainty, and your support can help decrease the high demand currently placed on grocery store stocks.
Healthy Corners
To ensure that nutritious food is available in all DC neighborhoods, DC Central Kitchen's Healthy Corners program is continuing operations and discounting fresh, whole fruits and vegetables up to 50%. You can find a full list of participating stores here. 
DC WIC’s food list is being expanded to allow for additional items to be purchased on WIC checks during the COVID-19 public health emergency. New allowable food items will be posted when guidance is available.

A Disturbing Look Inside an Italian Hospital
The Voices of the Loneliness Epidemic
A 97-Year-Old Philosopher Ponders Life and Death: 'What Is the Point?'
When the Italian media began reporting on the increased community spread of the novel coronavirus across the country, Olmo Parenti, like many Italian citizens, didn’t take the threat of the pandemic too seriously. “My friends and I were almost mocking the few people who believed the issue was serious from the get-go,” Parenti, a young filmmaker, told me.
Just days later, Parenti felt like he was living in a different version of reality—a dystopian one. The number of positive cases had spiked dramatically. The entire country had shut down. The economy took a nosedive. Hospitals, overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, were being forced to make impossible utilitarian decisions: Which critical patients would receive lifesaving artificial ventilation, while the others would effectively be left to die?
Parenti and his friends were disturbed by the fact that they had severely underestimated the situation, a perspective that perhaps contributed to the spread of the virus. “We read in the news that the U.S., England, Germany, and France were all taking the COVID-19 progression just as lightly as we had,” Parenti said. “We decided we had to redeem ourselves in some way.”

1st Confirmed Case of Coronavirus in New Hampshire
Officials in New Hampshire confirms it’s first case of coronavirus on Monday
State health officials announced the first case of coronavirus in New Hampshire on Monday morning.
Dr. Benjamin Chan, New Hampshire state epidemiologist, said at a press conference that one of the four people being tested for coronavirus came back positive. That person had recently traveled to Italy.
Chan said the person who tested positive is an adult from Grafton County in the northwestern part of the state. They are not sick enough to be hospitalized but are on home isolation.

The Associated Press reports that the person is a Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center employee. Hospital officials said they have set up an incident command center.
"We will be working very closely with healthcare providers in the community and the hospital system involved in order to investigate this case of COVID-19 and try and prevent further transmission in our community," Chan said.
He said since the person had recently traveled to Italy, health officials do not believe this represents wider spread community transmission.
2 Test Positive for Coronavirus in RI
A Rhode Island student and a dean have tested positive for coronavirus after a recent school trip to Europe. That Pawtucket school is now closed for cleaning.
State health officials also said they are aware that some schools have students who traveled to Italy over February break and have instructed those students to stay home for 14 days from travel to affected regions.
"We have been asked multiple times, 'Are we prepared for the introduction of this novel coronavirus in New Hampshire?' and I want to say 'Yes.' This is part of the core public health work that we do," Chan said.
"We have responded to multiple similar infectious disease threats over the years and even in decades," he said, from SARS, to H1N1, to Ebola.
More than 80,000 cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, have occurred worldwide since the virus emerged in China in late 2019. About 3,000 people have died.
The first reported deaths in the U.S. from the virus were confirmed over the weekend in Washington state.

Coronavirus (COVID-19)
Symptoms and what to do
Self-isolation if you or someone you live with has symptoms
To help stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), it's important to avoid face-to-face medical help whenever possible.
There are ways to get medical help, advice and prescriptions online or over the phone.
Health information and advice
The best place to get accurate health information is the NHS website.

Symptoms and what to do
Self-isolation if you or someone you live with has symptoms
Self-isolation helps stop coronavirus spreading
Do not leave your home if you have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) or live with someone who does.
This is called self-isolation.
If you have symptoms of coronavirus (a high temperature or a new, continuous cough), use the 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do.
If you have symptoms
If you have symptoms of coronavirus, you'll need to self-isolate for 7 days.
If you live with someone who has symptoms
If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started. This is because it can take 14 days for symptoms to appear.
If more than 1 person at home has symptoms, self-isolate for 14 days from the day the first person started having symptoms.
If you get symptoms, self-isolate for 7 days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're self-isolating for longer than 14 days.
If you do not get symptoms, you can stop self-isolating after 14 days.
After self-isolation
Read the coronavirus advice for everyone.
Get an isolation note to give to your employer
If you live with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus, you can get an isolation note to send to your employer as proof you need to stay off work.
Get an isolation note
If you have symptoms of coronavirus and need to stay at home, use the 111 coronavirus service to get an isolation note.
If you have symptoms and live with a vulnerable person
If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to arrange for them to stay with friends or family for 14 days.
Wash your laundry in the washing machine in the usual way. Laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people's items. Do not shake dirty laundry, as this may spread the virus in the air.

take paracetamol to help ease your symptoms
There is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (COVID-19) worse.
But until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you.
What to do if you need medical help while self-isolating
To protect others, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Stay at home.

GOV.UK: Coronavirus support
Our physical health has a big impact on how we feel. At times like these, it can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour that end up making you feel worse.
Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, drink enough water and exercise regularly. Avoid smoking or drugs, and try not to drink too much alcohol.
You might also want to consider limiting the time you spend watching, reading or listening to coverage of the outbreak, including on social media, and think about turning off breaking-news alerts on your phone.
NHS information on coronavirus
Concern about the coronavirus outbreak is perfectly normal. However, some people may experience intense anxiety that can affect their daily life.
It's fine to acknowledge that some things are outside of your control, but if constant thoughts about coronavirus are making you feel anxious or overwhelmed, try some ideas to help manage your anxiety or listening to an audio guide.
There are plenty of things you can do and places to get more help and support if you are struggling with your mental health.

Suspicious cyberactivity targeting HHS tied to coronavirus response, sources say
Coronavirus explained
Early cases of COVID-19 are believed to be linked to a live-animal market in Wuhan, China.
The Department of Health and Human Services experienced suspicious cyberactivity Sunday night related to its coronavirus response, administration sources confirmed to ABC News Monday.
The distinction is important because there was no apparent breach of the HHS system, which could interfere with critical functions of the lead agency responding to the coronavirus contagion. A DDOS effort enlists automated users -- called bots -- to overwhelm a public-facing system in order to slow it down or even paralyze it.
Nevertheless, the concern is that foreign actors might attempt to exploit the COVID-19 crisis to achieve some of their anti-American goals.

The Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., Feb. 27, 2020.
“As federal state and local governments focus on handling the current public health crisis, national security officials are also tracking other threats -- in particular those posed by terrorist or extremist groups and foreign adversaries who may seek to take advantage of all of the attention being focused on the coronavirus and conduct an attack,” said John Cohen, a former acting Undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security and contributor to ABC News.
“We are aware of a cyber incident related to the Health and Human Services computer networks and the federal government is investigating this incident thoroughly," NSC spokesman John Ullyot said in the statement. "HHS and federal government cybersecurity professionals are continuously monitoring and taking appropriate actions to secure our federal networks. HHS and federal networks are functioning normally at this time."
Intelligence and cyber officials are investigating to see if there is a connection to Sunday's messages saying there would be a national quarantine instituted, but as of now, they have not linked the two. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Cyber Security arm of the Department of Homeland Security, is saying it is supporting its government partners, and is highlighting a number of steps that it's taken in previous weeks.
“HHS has an IT infrastructure with risk-based security controls continuously monitored in order to detect and address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. On Sunday, we became aware of a significant increase in activity on HHS cyber infrastructure and are fully operational as we actively investigate the matter. Early on while preparing and responding to COVID-19, HHS put extra protections in place. We are coordinating with federal law enforcement and remain vigilant and focused on ensuring the integrity of our IT infrastructure, HHS spokesperson Caitlin Oakley said in a statement.

Coronavirus infection and pregnancy
These Q&As relate to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection and pregnancy – guidance for healthcare professionals: Version 5 - 28 March 2020 and Occupational health advice for employers and pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic – 26 March 2020 published by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Royal College of Midwives and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, with input from the Royal College of Anaesthetists, the Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association, Public Health England and Health Protection Scotland.
Q. What effect does coronavirus have on pregnant women?
Generally, pregnant women do not appear to be more likely to be seriously unwell than other healthy adults if they develop the new coronavirus. It is expected the large majority of pregnant women will experience only mild or moderate cold/flu like symptoms.
More severe symptoms such as pneumonia, seem to be appear to be more common in older people, those with weakened immune systems or long-term conditions. As yet, there is no evidence that pregnant women who get this infection are more at risk of serious complications than any other healthy individuals.
If you think you may have symptoms of COVID-19 you should use the NHS 111 online service for information, or NHS 24 if in Scotland. If you develop more severe symptoms or your recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that you are developing a more significant chest infection that requires specialised care. Our advice remains that if you feel your symptoms are worsening or if you are not getting better you should contact your maternity care team or use the NHS 111 online service / NHS 24 for further information and advice.
Q. What effect will coronavirus have on my baby if I am diagnosed with the infection?
As this is a very new virus we are just beginning to learn about it. There is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriage.
Initial reports from China showed no evidence of the virus passing from the mother to the baby during pregnancy or birth (vertical transmission). However, on the 26 March, new information was published: in one case from Wuhan, there is stronger evidence that vertical transmission may have occurred. This clearly requires further investigation and the RCOG is carefully monitoring all evidence as it is produced. It is important to emphasise that in all reported cases of newborn babies developing coronavirus very soon after birth, the baby was well.
Given current evidence, it is considered unlikely that if you have the virus it would cause problems with the baby’s development, and none have been observed currently.
Some babies born to women with symptoms of coronavirus in China have been born prematurely. It is unclear whether coronavirus caused early labour, or whether it was recommended that the baby was born early in order to preserve the mother’s health.
The UK is conducting near-real-time surveillance (observation) of all women who develop COVID-19 during pregnancy and their newborn babies, through well-established systems already used by all maternity units. We will update our information if and as soon as there is any change in the evidence.
Q. What can I do to reduce my risk of catching coronavirus?
Avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus. These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough
Work from home, where possible.
Pregnant woman were placed in a vulnerable group by the Chief Medical Officer on 16th March. This means you have been advised to reduce social contact through social distancing measures.
Based on the evidence we have so far, pregnant women are still no more likely to contract coronavirus than the general population. What we do know is that pregnancy in a small proportion of women can alter how your body handles severe viral infections. This is something that midwives and obstetricians have known for many years and are used to dealing with. As yet, there is no evidence that pregnant women who get coronavirus are more at risk of serious complications than any other healthy individuals.
What has driven the decisions made by officials to place pregnant women in the vulnerable category is caution. We know that some viral infections are worse in pregnant women. At the moment, there’s no evidence that this is the case for coronavirus infection, but the amount of evidence available is still quite limited.
As a precaution, you should follow government advice about social distancing; stay away from public places and avoid anyone who has symptoms suggestive of coronavirus.
If you are in your third trimester (more than 28 weeks pregnant) you should be particularly attentive to social distancing and minimising any contact with others.
Guidance on social distancing for all vulnerable people including pregnant women
Guidance for individuals and households with possible coronavirus infection
On 24 March, additional ‘shielding’ measures were announced for people defined on medical grounds to be at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus, this includes pregnant women with significant heart disease (congenital or acquired). If you are pregnant and have significant heart disease, it is strongly recommended that you follow these shielding measures to keep yourself save.
Maternity care is essential, and has been developed over many years to reduce complications in mothers and babies. There is a potential risk of harm to you and your baby if you don’t attend your appointments, even in the context of coronavirus.
If you are well, you should be able to attend your antenatal care as normal. If you have symptoms of possible coronavirus infection, you should contact your community midwife to postpone routine visits until after the isolation period is over.
Some appointments may be conducted on the telephone or using videoconferencing, provided there is a reasonable expectation that observations, such as blood pressure or other tests are not needed.
The recommendation that your bump will be measured from around 26 weeks of pregnancy should be observed by your maternity team unless you are in the recommended 14 day self isolation period.
If you have an urgent problem related to your pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, get in touch using the same emergency contact details you already have. Please do not contact this number unless you have an urgent problem
If you have symptoms suggestive of coronavirus contact your maternity services and they will arrange the right place and time to come for your visits. You should not attend a routine clinic.
Q. What impact will coronavirus have on my pregnancy?
The NHS is making arrangements to ensure that women are supported and cared for safely through pregnancy, birth and the period afterwards during this pandemic when there will be extra pressures on healthcare services.
Maternity units are increasingly providing consultations on the phone or by video link, when this is appropriate, so you do not have to travel unnecessarily to the hospital. However, some in person visits with a midwife are essential and it is important for the wellbeing of you and your baby that you attend these to have routine checks.
Q. Will my childbirth choices be affected by the coronavirus pandemic?
Like all areas of NHS care, maternity services will be affected by the pandemic but units are working to ensure services are provided in a way that is safe, with the levels of staff that are needed and the ability to provide emergency care where necessary.
If you have chosen to give birth at home or in a midwife-led unit that is not co-located with an obstetric unit, it is worth noting that these services rely on the availability of ambulance services to allow for rapid transfer to hospital, and the right number of staff to keep you safe. If these are not in place, it is possible that your Trust or Board may not be able to provide these services.
If your birth partner has symptoms of coronavirus, they will not be allowed to go into the maternity suite, to safeguard the health of the woman and the maternity staff supporting you
Advice for pregnant women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection
Q. What should I do if I think I may have coronavirus or been exposed?
You should stay at home for 7 days. Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you are staying at home. You do not need a test for coronavirus. At the present time, only people with severe symptoms who require overnight admission to hospital will be tested.
You should contact your maternity unit to inform them that you have symptoms suggestive of coronavirus, particularly if you have any routine appointments in the next 7 days.
You should use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service, or call NHS 111 if:
you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home
your symptoms do not get better after 7 days
If you have concerns about the wellbeing of yourself or your unborn baby during your self-isolation period, contact your midwife or, out-of-hours, your maternity team. They will provide further advice, including whether you need to attend hospital.
Q. How will I be tested for coronavirus?
The process for diagnosing coronavirus infection is changing rapidly. At the current time, only people with severe symptoms who need at least overnight admission to hospital will be tested.
Q. What should I do if I test positive for coronavirus?
If you test positive for coronavirus, you should contact your midwife or antenatal team to make them aware of your diagnosis. If you have no symptoms, or mild symptoms, you will be advised to recover at home. If you have more severe symptoms, you might be treated in hospital.
You have symptoms of coronavirus, such as a high temperature or new, continuous cough
You have tested positive for coronavirus and you’ve been advised to recover at home
The NHS guidance on self-isolation currently recommends people should:
Q. Can I still attend my antenatal appointments if I am in self-isolation?
You should contact your midwife or antenatal clinic to inform them that you are currently in self-isolation for possible/confirmed coronavirus and ask for advice on going to routine antenatal appointments.
It is likely that routine antenatal appointments will be delayed until isolation ends. If your midwife or doctor advises that your appointment cannot wait, the necessary arrangements will be made for you to be seen. For example, you may be asked to attend at a different time, or in a different clinic, to protect others.
Q.How will my care be managed after I have recovered from coronavirus?
If you have confirmed coronavirus infection, as a precautionary approach, an ultrasound scan will be arranged at least two weeks after your recovery, to check that your baby is well.
If you have recovered from coronavirus and tested negative for the virus before you go into labour, where and how you give birth will not be affected by your previous illness. Visitor numbers may be restricted to promote recommended social distancing but your birth partner will be able to be with you, provided they are not unwell.
Q. What do I do if I feel unwell or I’m worried about my baby during self-isolation?
Pregnant women who are self-isolating are advised not to attend maternity units or A&E unless in need of urgent pregnancy or medical care.
If you have concerns about the wellbeing of yourself or your unborn baby during your self-isolation period, contact your midwife or, out-of-hours, your maternity team. They will provide further advice, including whether you need to attend hospital.
If you are advised to go to the maternity unit or hospital, pregnant women are asked to travel by private transport, or arrange hospital transport, and alert the maternity unit reception once on the premises, before going into the hospital.
Q. Will being in self-isolation for suspected or confirmed coronavirus affect where I give birth?
As a precautionary approach, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus when they go into labour, are being advised to go to obstetric unit for birth, where the baby can be monitored using continuous electronic fetal monitoring, and your oxygen levels can be monitored hourly.
Q. Will being in self-isolation for suspected or confirmed coronavirus affect how I give birth?
There is currently no evidence to suggest you cannot give birth vaginally or that you would be safer having a caesarean birth if you have suspected or confirmed coronavirus, so your birth choices should be respected and followed as closely as possible based on your wishes.
It is not recommended that you give birth in a birthing pool in hospital if you have suspected or confirmed coronavirus, as the virus can sometimes be found in faeces. This means it could contaminate the water, causing infection to pass to the baby. It may also be more difficult for healthcare staff to use adequate protection equipment during a water birth.
There is no evidence that women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cannot have an epidural or a spinal block. In our previous version of the guidance it was suggested that the use of Entonox (gas and air) may increase aerosolisation and spread of the virus, but a review of the evidence suggests there is no evidence that Entonox is an aerosol-prone procedure, so there is no reason you cannot use this in labour.
Q. What happens if I go into labour during my self-isolation period?
If you go into labour, you should call your maternity unit for advice, and inform them that you have suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection.
If you have mild symptoms, you will be encouraged to remain at home (self-isolating) in early labour, as usual.
When you and your maternity team decide you need to attend the maternity unit, general recommendations about hospital attendance will apply:
You will be advised to attend hospital via private transport where possible, or call 111/999 for advice, as appropriate
You will be met at the maternity unit entrance and provided with a surgical face mask, which will need to stay on until you are isolated in a suitable room
Coronavirus testing will be arranged
Q. Could I pass coronavirus to my baby?
As this is a new virus, there is limited evidence about caring for women with coronavirus infection in women when they have just given birth. A small number of babies have been diagnosed with coronavirus shortly after birth, so there is a chance that infection may have occurred in the womb, but it is not certain whether transmission was before or soon after birth. Your maternity team will maintain strict infection control measures at the time of your birth and closely monitor your baby.
Q. Will my baby be tested for coronavirus?
If you have confirmed or suspected coronavirus when the baby is born, doctors who specialise in the care of newborn babies (neonatal doctors) will examine your baby and advise you about their care, including whether they need testing.
Q. Will I be able to stay with my baby/give skin-to-skin if I have suspected or confirmed coronavirus?
In some other countries, women with confirmed coronavirus have been advised to separate from their baby for 14 days. However, this may have potential negative effects on feeding and bonding.
Q. Will I be able to breastfeed my baby if I have suspected or confirmed coronavirus?
Yes. There is no evidence showing that the virus can be carried in breastmilk, the well-recognised benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of coronavirus through breastmilk.
The main risk of breastfeeding is close contact between you and your baby, as if you cough or sneeze, this could contain droplets which are infected with the virus, leading to infection of the baby after birth.
Consider wearing a face mask while breastfeeding, if available
If you choose to feed your baby with formula or expressed milk, it is recommend that you follow strict adherence to sterilisation guidelines. If you are expressing breast milk in hospital, a dedicated breast pump should be used.
Occupational health guidance for pregnant women who work in a public-facing role
We understand that it must be an anxious time if you are pregnant and you work in a public facing role, following the Chief Medical Officer’s advice on 16 March 2020 that all pregnant women are in a vulnerable group.
Pregnant women who can work from home should do so. If you can’t work from home, if you work in a public-facing role that can be modified appropriately to minimise your exposure, this should be considered and discussed with your occupational health team or employer.
More detailed occupational health advice for pregnant women, including those who cannot work from home was published on 21 March 2020, and updated on 26 March. It recommends that if you are in your first or second trimester (less than 28 weeks pregnant), with no underlying health conditions, you should practise social distancing but can choose to continue to work in a public-facing role, provided the necessary precautions are taken - these include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and risk assessment.
If you are in your third trimester (more than 28 weeks pregnant), or have an underlying health condition – such as heart or lung disease - you should work from home where possible, avoid contact with anyone with symptoms of coronavirus, and significantly reduce unnecessary social contact. Read the government guidance on social distancing.
Q. What is the advice if I am a healthcare worker and pregnant?
The guidance was updated on 26 March to emphasise that pregnant women of any gestation should be offered the choice of whether to work in direct patient-facing roles during the coronavirus pandemic. Your choices on whether you continue to work in direct patient-facing roles during the coronavirus pandemic should be respected and supported by your employers. stetricians and Gynaecologists and
Advice for pregnant healthcare workers before 28 weeks gestation
If you are in your first or second trimester (less than 28 weeks pregnant), with no underlying health conditions, you should practise social distancing but can choose to continue to work in a patient-facing role. If you choose to continue working, it is strongly recommended the necessary precautions are taken. You should avoid, where possible, caring for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection. If this is not possible, you should use personal protective equipment (PPE) and ensure a thorough risk assessment is undertaken.
Some working environments, such as operating theatres, respiratory wards and intensive care/high dependency units, carry a higher risk for all pregnant women of exposure to the virus and all healthcare workers in these settings are recommended to use appropriate PPE.
Advice for pregnant healthcare workers after 28 weeks gestation, or with an underlying health condition
If you are in your third trimester (more than 28 weeks pregnant), or have an underlying health condition – such as heart or lung disease – we strongly recommend you avoid direct patient contact. It is better to work from home where possible, avoid contact with anyone with symptoms of coronavirus, and significantly reduce unnecessary social contact.
We encourage employers to seek opportunities for pregnant healthcare workers in their third trimester to work flexibly in a different capacity, to avoid roles where they are working directly with patients.
Whatever gestation of your pregnancy, you should discuss your individual circumstances with your local Occupational Health department.
The evidence base for this new virus is growing rapidly and, as and when new information emerges, the Government and professional bodies will update the guidance.

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) – Statistics and Research
Note: To inform yourself and understand the risk to the public we recommend to rely on your government body responsible for health and the World Health Organization – their site is here.
The COVID-19 outbreak is an unprecedented global public health challenge. In order for governments, organisations and individuals to respond to it effectively, it will be vital that they have easy access to good, clear data and a good understanding of what can and can not be said based on the available data.
The mission of Our World in Data is to make the best research on the world’s largest problems available and understandable. While most of our work focuses on large problems that humanity has faced for a long time – such as child mortality, natural disasters, poverty and almost 100 other problems (see here) – this article focuses on a new, emerging global problem: the ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease [COVID-19].
We present information on the number of deaths and cases; on why we should focus on how quickly those numbers double, not on the numbers themselves; on the prevalence of testing, and why that is important for understanding the disease; and what we can and can’t know about how lethal COVID-19 really is. We’ll also explain where we get our data from and why.
We list all our visualizations – more than 40 in total – on the pandemic on this page.
Even the best existing research and data is preliminary and will be revised as the pandemic progresses.
We reviewed existing global data sources and decided to rely on the global statistics published by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Deaths
During a disease outbreak it is the growth rate that deserves attention. We present a table that lists how fast the number of deaths is doubling.
In interactive charts we present the data on confirmed deaths in all countries in the world.
Without widespread testing for COVID-19 we can neither know how the pandemic is spreading nor appropriately respond to it.
The total number of COVID-19 cases is not known. It is however certain that the total number of COVID-19 cases is higher than the number of known confirmed cases. This is mainly due to limited testing.
Just as we do for deaths, we focus on the growth rate of confirmed cases. We present a sortable table that lists how fast the number of confirmed cases is doubling.
In interactive charts we present the data on confirmed cases over time in all countries in the world.
The case fatality rate (CFR) – the ratio between confirmed deaths and cases – is widely discussed, but during the outbreak of a pandemic with large unknowns it is important to know what can and cannot be said based on currently available statistics.
In this document and the many embedded and linked charts we report and visualize the data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
The European CDC publishes daily statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic. Not just for Europe, but for the entire world.
Deaths from COVID-19
Confirmed deaths to date is what we know
What we know is the total number of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 to date. Limited testing and challenges in the attribution of the cause of death means that the number of confirmed deaths may not be an accurate count of the true total number of deaths from COVID-19.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) publishes daily updates of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19. We rely on this data as explained above.
In an ongoing outbreak the final outcomes – death or recovery – for all cases is not yet known. The time from symptom onset to death ranges from 2 to 8 weeks for COVID-19.1 This means that some people who are currently infected with COVID-19 will die at a later date. As we explain below, this needs to be kept in mind when comparing the current number of deaths with the current number of cases.
What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19?
To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it.
We will look into this question in more detail further below in this article and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death (scroll there).
The growth rate of COVID-19 deaths
How long did it take for the number of confirmed deaths to double?
In an outbreak of an infectious disease it is important to not only study the number of deaths, but also the growth rate at which the number of deaths is increasing.
This is because even if the current numbers of deaths are small when compared with other diseases, a fast growth rate can lead to very large numbers rapidly.
To report the rate of change we focus on the question: How long did it take for the number of confirmed deaths to double?
Let’s take an example: if three days ago there had been 500 confirmed deaths in total, and today we have reached 1,000, then the doubling time is three days.2
The doubling time of deaths has changed and it will change in the future; we should not naively extrapolate the current doubling time to conclude how many people will die.3
If deaths go up by a fixed number over a fixed period – say, by 500 every two days – then we call that “linear” growth. But if they keep on doubling within a fixed time period – say, every three days – then we call that “exponential” growth.
If, during an outbreak, the time it takes for deaths to double remains constant, then the disease is spreading exponentially.
Under exponential growth 500 deaths grow to more than 1 million deaths after 11 doubling times.4 And after 10 more doubling times it would be 1 billion deaths.
This isn’t to say that we should expect to see numbers like that in the COVID-19 outbreak, but it is a reminder that exponential growth leads to very large numbers very quickly, even when starting from a low base.
Growth in COVID-19 deaths, by country
The table below shows how long it has taken for the number of deaths to double in each country for which we have data. The table also shows how the total number of confirmed deaths, and the number of daily new confirmed deaths, and how those numbers have changed over the last 14 days.
We break the data down by country because some countries – like China and Korea – have very substantial countermeasures in place, and new daily confirmed deaths have declined (see the chart here).
Many other countries do not have comparable measures in place, and numbers are quickly rising. If we just look at the global average, we will not see these differences.
Data: The data shown here is published by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Here is our documentation of the data and an option to download all data.

Confirmed COVID-19 deaths by country
In the charts here, you can find data on the number of new deaths and the total number so far, for every country.
The data shown here is published by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Here is the documentation of the data and an option to download all data.
The figures do not necessarily show the number of people who had died by a given date, but how many deaths had been reported by that date. For example, data shown for 25th March presents the latest figures as of 10am CET on 25th March.
Confirmed COVID-19 deaths relative to the size of the population
This is why the chart and the two maps below show the deaths per million people of each country’s population.
Deaths per million were calculated by Our World in Data by dividing the ECDC’s numbers of deaths by population figures published in the United Nations’ World Population Prospects.
Are deaths increasing at different rates in different countries?
Are the number of deaths rising faster in China, Italy, Spain, South Korea, or the US?
The charts above are not very useful to answer these types of questions, because the outbreak of COVID-19 did not happen, and did not increase rapidly, on the same day in all countries.
This chart allows the reader to compare the trajectory of confirmed cases between countries. The starting point for each country is the day that particular country had reached 5 total confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
On the x-axis we see the days since the 5th confirmed death, and on the y-axis, the total number of confirmed deaths.
We also show the trajectory of confirmed deaths adjusted for population size – here presented as the number of deaths per million people. This is shown from the day that a given country reached 0.1 deaths per million people.
Relative to the size of the population: This chart shows the trajectories for deaths per million.
Testing for COVID-19
One of the most important things that countries are doing to help understand and stop the spread of COVID-19 is testing. Here we explain why testing is important, what it involves, and how many tests countries are doing based on available data from official sources.
Testing allows infected people to know that they are infected. This can help them receive the care they need; and it can help them take measures to reduce the probability of infecting others. People who don’t know they are infected might not stay at home and thereby risk infecting others.
Testing is also crucial for an appropriate response to the pandemic. It allows us to understand the spread of the disease and to take evidence-based measures to slow down the spread of the disease.7
Unfortunately, the capacity for COVID-19 testing is still low in many countries around the world. For this reason we still do not have a good understanding of the spread of the pandemic.
To understand the impact of COVID-19, we need to know things like how easily it spreads, and how dangerous it is for people who have it. So that means we need to know how many people are infected. That’s difficult, because the disease can look a lot like other illnesses, like flu, and in some people the symptoms are very mild. 
To understand how infectious the disease is, and how dangerous, we need to test people to see if they have it. For instance, if you know that 100 people have died from it, it makes a difference whether that’s out of 1,000 people who have had the disease, or 100,000. The best way to fight against a disease that spreads very easily but doesn’t kill many of those infected is very different to the best way to fight against a disease that spreads more slowly but is more deadly.
Also, testing allows infected people to get the care they need and to take precautions. If they don’t know they’re infected, they might not stay home, and put other people at risk.
Perhaps most importantly, testing lets healthcare workers identify people with the disease, and help isolate them and the people they’ve been in contact with.8
Unfortunately, many countries still don’t have enough capacity for COVID-19 testing. That shortage is one reason why we still don’t fully understand how the disease spreads.
Unfortunately, the capacity for COVID-19 testing is still low in many countries around the world. For this reason we still do not have a good understanding of the spread of the pandemic.
How are COVID-19 tests done?
The most common tests for COVID-19 involve taking a swab from a patient’s nose and throat and checking them for the genetic footprint of the virus. They are called “PCR tests”. The first PCR tests for COVID-19 were developed very rapidly – within two weeks of the disease being identified – and they are now part of the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s recommended protocol for dealing with the disease.9
Here you can find an explainer video on how the tests for coronavirus disease work.

The tests are not perfect: sometimes, people who have the disease will be wrongly told that they do not
The number of COVID-19 tests carried out will be similar to the number of people tested, but they won’t be quite the same, because some people may need to be tested multiple times. The reason for this is that there are “false-negative” test outcomes.11,12,13,14 
A “false-negative” outcome is when someone is tested and found to be clear of the disease, but when tested again, are found to have it. The WHO’s guidelines for laboratory testing of COVID-19 say that negative results “do not rule out the possibility of COVID-19 virus infection.”15
This means that even in countries that have done lots of tests, the true number of COVID-19 cases is still uncertain, although of course more testing still means more certainty.
Why might COVID-19 tests fail?
There are several reasons why someone infected with COVID-19 may produce a false-negative result when tested:17,18
They may be in the early stage of the disease with a viral load that is too low to be detected.
They may have no major respiratory symptoms, so there could be little detectable virus in the patient’s throat and nose.
There may have been technical issues inherent in the test, e.g. virus mutation.
The WHO suggests that these issues should be taken into account and that for some people, tests should be carried out several times.19
Cases of COVID-19
To understand the scale of the COVID-19 outbreak, and respond appropriately, we would want to know how many people are infected by COVID-19. We would want to know the total number of cases.
However, the total number of COVID-19 cases is not known. When media outlets claim to report the ‘number of cases’ they are not being precise and omit to say that it is the number of confirmed cases they speak about.
Confirmed cases is what we do know
What we do know is the number of confirmed cases.
A confirmed case is “a person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection” as World Health Organization (WHO) explains.20 But specifics can differ and the European CDC, on which we rely, reports confirmed cases according to the applied case definition in the countries.21
What is important however is that the number of confirmed cases is certainly not the same as the number of total cases. Confirmed cases are therefore only a subset of the total number of cases. It is a count of only those people who have COVID-19 and for whom a lab has confirmed this diagnosis. For this reason we emphasized the importance of testing in the section before.
The total number of confirmed cases is of course also not the same as the total number of all current cases. This is because for some of them the disease has ended and they have either recovered or died from it. We discuss how long the disease lasts further below (scroll there).
Why is the number of confirmed cases lower than the number of total cases?
The number of confirmed cases is lower than the number of total cases because not everyone is tested. Not all cases have a “laboratory confirmation”, testing is what makes the difference between the number of confirmed and total cases.
Since an understanding of testing for COVID-19 is crucial for an interpretation of the reported numbers of confirmed cases we have looked into the testing for COVID-19 in more detail.
Growth of cases: How long did it take for the number of confirmed cases to double?
As for the number of deaths, it is not only important to study the number of cases, but also how they increase over time. Their growth rate.
To report the rate of change we focus on the question: How long did it take for the number of confirmed cases to double?
In this section, we’ll look at the numbers of confirmed cases in different countries. Just as with the number of deaths from the disease, we are interested not only in the absolute numbers, but in how quickly they grow, because the nature of exponential growth means that even if a country has a small number of cases now, they could increase very quickly.
Again as we did with deaths, we focus on the question: How long did it take for the number of confirmed cases to double? For instance, if three days ago there had been 5,000 cases reported to date in the United Kingdom, and today there have been a total of 10,000, we would say that the doubling time is three days.
To report the rate of change we focus on the question: How long did it take for the number of confirmed cases to double?
Growth in COVID-19 cases, by country
The table here shows how long it has taken for the number of cases to double in each country for which we have data. The table also shows how the total number of confirmed cases, and the number of daily new confirmed cases, and how those numbers have changed over the last 14 days.
We break the data down by country because some countries – like China and Korea – have very substantial countermeasures in place, and new daily confirmed cases have declined (see the chart here).
Many other countries do not have comparable measures in place, and numbers are quickly rising. If we just look at the global average, we will not see these differences.

In our visualizations here you can explore the number of total confirmed cases and daily new confirmed cases for all countries with reported cases. This is shown in absolute numbers, and adjusted for population size by showing total and new confirmed cases per million people.
Data: The data shown here is published by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Here is the documentation of the data and an option to download all data.
Confirmed COVID-19 cases relative to the size of the population
Cases per million were calculated by Our World in Data by dividing the ECDC’s numbers of deaths by population figures published in the United Nations’ World Population Prospects.
The COVID-19 outbreak started in different countries at different times, and now those countries are at different stages. For instance, on 25 March, Italy had reported 74,386 confirmed cases, while the UK had only reported 8,077.
Other countries saw a much slower increase. The speed at which the number of confirmed cases increased in Singapore and Japan was much slower than in other countries.
The trajectory of China and South Korea shows that the speed at which cases rise is not necessarily constant over time. Both countries saw a rapid initial rise but then implemented severe countermeasures (see here), and the trajectory became flatter, meaning that the spread of the disease has slowed down.
We also show the trajectory of confirmed cases adjusted for population size – here presented as the number of confirmed cases per million people. This is shown from the day that a given country reached 1 confirmed case per million people.
The COVID-19 pandemic
The name of the disease and the virus
Diseases and the viruses or bacteria that cause them often have different names. For instance, the “human immunodeficiency virus”, HIV, causes “acquired immunodeficiency syndrome”, AIDS.
The virus causing the current outbreak is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, shortened to SARS-CoV-2. The disease is called coronavirus disease, shortened to COVID-19.
These names have been assigned by the World Health Organization and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.22
The WHO also refers to the virus as “the virus responsible for COVID-19” or “the COVID-19 virus” when communicating with the public. We follow the same conventions here.
How did the outbreak start?
The outbreak was first noticed in the city of Wuhan, China. Wuhan is the capital of the Hubei Province and has about 11 million inhabitants. On 29 December 2019, Chinese authorities identified a cluster of similar cases of pneumonia in the city.
These cases were soon determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus that was later named SARS-CoV-2.23
The first cases of COVID-19 outside of China were identified on January 13 in Thailand and on January 16 in Japan.
On January 23rd the city of Wuhan and other cities in the region were placed on lockdown by the Chinese Government.
Since then COVID-19 has spread to many more countries – cases have been reported in all world regions. By March it developed into a global pandemic and was declared as such by the WHO.
What is a coronavirus?
Although people often refer to the virus causing COVID-19 as “the coronavirus”, there are many different coronaviruses.
The term refers to a group of viruses that are common in humans: coronaviruses are the cause for around 30% of cases of the common cold.24 Corona is Latin for “crown” – this group of viruses is given its name due to the fact that its surface looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
Two outbreaks of new diseases in recent history were also caused by coronaviruses – SARS in 2003 that resulted in around 1,000 deaths25 and MERS in 2012 that resulted in 862 deaths.26
Strategies to respond to COVID-19
The intention of early containment
Reducing the peak of the outbreak can allow the healthcare system to provide care for more people
It may sound strange, but even a disease which is mild in most cases can kill a large number of people, if it infects a sufficiently large fraction of the population. COVID-19 can be mild – it may even be that most people show no symptoms at all – but in a minority of cases, especially among the elderly or otherwise ill, it can be very severe, as we discuss here.
‘Flattening the curve’
This is why it is important in an epidemic for governments and other bodies to respond quickly. The aim is to lower the rate of infection, so that the epidemic is spread out over time and the peak demand on the healthcare system is lower.
Containment measures are intended to avoid an outbreak trajectory in which a large number of people get sick at the same time. This is what the visualization shows.
That means that even if the same number of people get sick overall, the healthcare system is able to treat more of them, because they’re not all happening simultaneously.
Otherwise, the number needing treatment at the same time can get so large that health systems are overwhelmed, and become unable to provide adequate care for some patients.28
What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19?
There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? 
This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. There are several numbers that can help us get towards it – statistics such as the total number of confirmed cases, and the number of deaths so far – but those measures don’t tell us everything we need to know.
Here we explain why that is, and what we can be sure about. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different.
The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the true answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death.
The case fatality rate (CFR)
In the media, the risk of death from COVID-19 is usually presented as the “case fatality rate”, sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR.
But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story.
The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%.
But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person.
Another important metric, which is very different from the CFR, is the crude mortality rate.
The crude mortality rate
The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that sounds like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die?
The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population. For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be 10/1,000, or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease.
This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people.29 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%.
But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here.]
What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate: it’s the infection fatality rate
Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate, or IFR.
The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases. If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is 10/500, or 2%.30,31,32,33,34
To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. 
However, as we explain (here) the total number of cases is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested.35,36 
Interpreting the case fatality rate
In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers.
The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context
The media tend to talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population. 
The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just dependent on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it.
This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change, and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones.
The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location and has changed during the early period of the outbreak
As this chart shows, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. This chart was published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), in February 2020.37
It shows the CFR values for COVID- in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January 2020 to 20th February 2020.
You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue).
But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined. The WHO says that “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. The CFR fell to 0.7% for patients with the onset of symptoms after February 1st.
This shows that what we said about the CFR more generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value.
Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020)38
There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death
If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability?
When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people.
As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases (here), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases.
And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%.
Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases.
Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts.
When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, many of those who are currently sick and will die have not yet died.
In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This will mean the CFR is lower than the true risk.
With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here).39 
That means that some people who are now counted as confirmed cases and who will die are not yet included in the number of deaths. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course.
This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown.
This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak.40
This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end.41,42
This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response.
The current case fatality rate of COVID-19
We should stress again that the CFR of a disease is not fixed. It varies by location, and typically changes over time. But, if we are careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us understand more about the severity of the disease, and how best to respond.
The paper shows that the CFR varies widely from country to country, from just 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it adds that this does not tell us accurately the risk of death for an infected person in each country. We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied. Without better and more standardised testing and recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown.
But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us determine what we know about the severity of the disease, and how to respond.
In this chart we can see how these early CFR values might compare. It shows the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis). Since the CFR is the ratio between the total deaths and total confirmed cases, we can use this comparison to see where each country would lie in terms of its CFR.
The grey lines show a range of CFR values – ranging from 0.25% to 10%. Where each country lies gives an indication of its CFR i.e. if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.
With these caveats in mind, the other visualization here shows the CFR for countries which have more than 100 confirmed cases. This means we have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases: this is because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.
We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, which would have a CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall as the number of confirmed cases increases, but it’s not until it reaches hundreds of cases that the CFR falls below 20%.
Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age
The total population-level estimate of the case fatality rate (CFR) above is useful for understanding the average severity of an outbreak, but does not tell us who within a population is most at risk. But this understanding is crucial in an outbreak. Understanding the relative risk to different sections of a population allows us to focus on the most vulnerable, and improve the allocation of health resources to those who need them most.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has published an analysis of recorded cases and deaths in China for the period until February 11th 2020 which provides a breakdown of all known cases, deaths and the CFR by specific demographics (age, sex, preexisting condition etc.).44
In the visualization we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age. 
This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March.45,46
Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the ratio between the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths. The CFR continues to change over time, and comparisons between countries do not necessarily reflect differences in the likelihood of dying from COVID-19; they can instead reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.
For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. We see this for malaria: the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five years of age. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918 it was primarily children and young adults who died from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here).
For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying if infected with this virus.
As we show in the following section, the CFR for people with underlying health conditions is higher than for those without. One possible reason why the elderly might be most at risk is that they are also those who are most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes. 
Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions
Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk
The visualization here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition.
This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s initial breakdown of cases, deaths and CFR among specific demographics in the population.47 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020.
The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without.
More than 10% of those diagnosed with COVID-19 who already had a cardiovascular disease, died as a result of the virus. Diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart.
The CFR was 0.9% for those without a preexisting health condition.
Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. This might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection.
Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases
How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases?
Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak.
As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively.48
The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% – much lower than the current CFR for COVID-19.

Disease Estimated case fatality rate (CFR)
SARS-CoV 10%
Seasonal flu (US) 0.1%
40% in the 2013-16 outbreak
How do case fatality rates from COVID-19 compare to those of the seasonal flu?
This question is answered in the visualization here. We compare the CFR during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China with the CFR of the US seasonal flu in 2018-19.
The case fatality rate of the seasonal flu in the US is around 0.1% to 0.2%, while the case fatality rate for COVID-19, measured in the cited study, was 2.3%.
The US data is sourced from the US CDC. Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses. This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here.
This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.
Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.
So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits (shown in square brackets). It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.
You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here. The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.49
The CFRs for COVID-19 are again based on the numbers reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.50 As before, the Chinese data refers to recorded deaths and confirmed cases in China as of February 11th 2020.
As we emphasise, the global CFR for COVID-19 continues to change over time, and can vary significantly by location.
While the CFR for COVID-19 is much higher than the CFR of the seasonal flu the two diseases are similar in the profile of the fatality rate by age: elderly populations have higher case fatality rates.
However, the CFR of COVID-19 is much higher for all age groups, including young people. On top of each bar we have indicated how much higher the CFR for COVID-19 is for each age group.
Healthcare capacity
To respond to the pandemic, the capacity of the healthcare system is of great importance.
The two maps here show the number of medical doctors and hospital beds relative to the size of each country’s population.
The discussion of the age-specific mortality above showed that the current evidence suggests that older population are at a higher risk from COVID-19.
The purpose of this article on COVID-19 is to aggregate existing research, bring together the relevant data and allow readers to make sense of the published data and early research on the coronavirus outbreak.
Most of our work focuses on established problems, for which we can refer to well-established research and data. COVID-19 is different. All data and research on the virus is preliminary; researchers are rapidly learning more about a new and evolving problem. It is certain that the research we present here will be revised in the future. But based on our mission we feel it is our role to present clearly what the current research and data tells us about this emerging problem and especially to provide an understanding of what can and cannot be said based on this available knowledge.
In this document and the associated charts we report and visualize the data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Established in 2005 and based in Stockholm it is an EU agency with the aim to strengthen Europe’s defense against infectious diseases.
The European CDC publishes daily statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic. Not just for Europe, but for the entire world.
The European CDC collects and aggregates data from countries around the world. The most up-to-date data for any particular country is therefore typically available earlier via the national health agencies than via the ECDC.
We rely on the ECDC as they collect and harmonize data from around the world which allows us to compare what is happening in different countries. The European CDC data provides a global perspective on the evolving pandemic.
Why we stopped relying on data from the World Health Organization
Until March 18 we relied on the World Health Organization (WHO) as our source. We aimed to rely on the WHO as they are the international agency with the mandate to provide official estimates on the pandemic. The WHO reports this data for each single day and they can be found here at the WHO’s site.
Since March 18 it became unfortunately impossible to rely on the WHO data to understand how the pandemic is developing over time. With Situation Report 58 the WHO shifted the reporting cutoff time from 0900 CET to 0000 CET. This means that comparability is compromised because there is an overlap between these two WHO data publications (Situation Reports 57 and 58).
The World Health Organization (WHO), researchers from Johns Hopkins University, and other institutions all maintain datasets on the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries from the disease.
Johns Hopkins data on COVID-19
A dashboard is published and hosted by researchers at the Center for Systems Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University. It shows the number and location of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in all affected countries.
The researchers have the intention to “continue hosting and managing the tool throughout the entirety of the COVID-19 outbreak”.
Scientific Paper: The background paper for the Johns Hopkins’ dashboard was published by Dong, Du, and Gardner (2020) in The Lancet Infectious Disease.51 This paper also includes a comparison of this data with the data reported by the WHO and the Chinese CDC.
WHO data on COVID-19
The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes a dashboard similar to that of Johns Hopkins above.
The WHO dashboard on global cases and deaths is embedded here. In this dashboard it is possible to see up-to-date country specific data by selecting the country in the top right.
In addition to this dashboard, the WHO publishes daily Situation Reports which can be found here. It is the daily Situation reports that we rely on in our own published datasets on case and death numbers. Unlike the daily Situation Reports, the WHO dashboard is updated three times per day: any inconsistencies between the WHO dashboard and the data we present will be explained by this fact.
The nCoV-2019 Data Working Group, which includes colleagues from the University of Oxford, publishes epidemiological data from the outbreak via this global dashboard. From this dashboard it is possible to obtain the underlying data which includes demographic and epidemiological descriptions of a long list of individual cases.
Their data on the list of cases includes individual travel history and key dates for each patient – date of onset of symptoms, date of hospitalisation and date of laboratory confirmation of whether the person was infected with the COVID-19 virus or not.
This data is intended to be helpful in the estimation of key statistics for the disease: Incubation period, basic reproduction number (R0), age-stratified risk, risk of importation.
In previous disease outbreaks such global individual data was not openly available.
Data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention publishes data via their dedicated site ‘Tracking the epidemic‘.

Pneumonia – Severe cases of COVID-19 can progress to pneumonia.52 Our entry on pneumonia provides an overview of the data and research on this disease that kills 2.6 million annually.

Vaccination – Vaccines are key in making progress against infectious diseases and save millions of lives every year. A vaccine against COVID-19 would be the scientific breakthrough that could end this pandemic.
Healthcare financing – A strong healthcare system is key to make progress against the infectious disease. In this entry we are studying how healthcare is financed.
Causes of death – 56 million people die every year. What do they die from? How did the causes of death change over time?
Smoking – In this entry we study the prevalence of smoking and its global health impact. Smoking is a risk factor for COVID-19 as it increases the chance of getting infected and can increase the severity of the disease.53

Note that this metric is distinct from other possible ways in which a doubling time can be calculated. It is for example also possible to calculate the doubling time implied by the current daily rate of change. But the reporting of confirmed cases and deaths is very ‘noisy’ – one day the statistical agency does not report new confirmed cases, but the next day it is reporting all the new cases within the last two days for example. Doubling time based on the most recent daily growth rate is therefore more susceptible to this type of noise from day-to-day variability in reporting.
One way to see that this is true is to ask when the number of deaths would be larger than the total world population. Starting from 4,500 deaths it would only take 23 doublings for the number of deaths to be larger than the world population.
For example, the report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease, 16-24 February 2020, online here, explains on page 34: “Development of rapid and accurate point-of-care tests which perform well in field settings are especially useful if the test can be incorporated into presently commercially available multiplex respiratory virus panels. This would markedly improve early detection and isolation of infected patients and, by extension, identification of contacts.”

The report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease, 16-24 February 2020, online here, explains that in addition to PCR tests, there are other diagnostic methods that remain less common, including serological diagnostic tests that rely on antibody assays using a blood sample. According to the WHO-China Joint Mission, the timeline for the development of the PCR tests was as follows: (i) On 29 December 2019 Chinese authorities identified a cluster of similar cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan in China; (ii) on 7 January, the virus found to cause COVID-19 was initially isolated from a clinical sample; (iii) on 16 January, the first PCR assays for COVID-19 were distributed to Hubei, China.

The report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease, 16-24 February 2020, online here,  says that as well as PCR tests, there are other, less common means of testing. One is the “serological” diagnostic test. It looks at the patient’s blood to see if there are antibodies for fighting the virus. Since the body only produces antibodies in response to the disease (or, if one arrives, a vaccine), we know that people who have antibodies must have had the disease in the past, even if they have no virus in their bodies now. According to the WHO-China Joint Mission, the timeline for the development of the PCR tests was as follows: (i) On 29 December 2019 Chinese authorities identified a cluster of similar cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan in China; (ii) on 7 January, the virus found to cause COVID-19 was initially isolated from a clinical sample; (iii) on 16 January, the first PCR assays for COVID-19 were distributed to Hubei, China.

This advice from the WHO is also implemented at national and local levels for testing. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US publishes a Fact Sheet for testing COVID-19, explaining the following : “A negative test result for this test means that SARSCoV-2 RNA was not present in the specimen above the limit of detection. However, a negative result does not rule out COVID-19 and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions. A negative result does not exclude the possibility of COVID-19. When diagnostic testing is negative, the possibility of a false negative result should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19.” CDC (2020) Fact sheet for healthcare providers, CDC – 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, March 15, 2020.

Our World In Data is a project of the Global Change Data Lab, a registered charity in England and Wales (Charity Number 1186433).
Coronavirus Source Data
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control – the data source we rely on
Our article on the Coronavirus Disease [COVID-19] presents daily global and national statistics on the number of cases and deaths from the outbreak. Initially we relied only on data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Since March 19 our data is sourced from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). We explain the reasons for this change in the section on the WHO below.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ECDC provides three statistical resources on the COVID-19 pandemic:
COVID-19 Dashboard 
The ECDC publishes full time-series data for the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths daily for countries around the world.
Each day the ECDC collects data from 6am to 10am CET and publishes this data via its COVID-19 dashboard. This dataset is then also made publicly available through downloadable CSV files at 1pm CET. Its daily Situation Reports are then update to reflect this new data from 2pm to 4pm CET.
The date here reflects to the date of reporting, not necessarily the confirmed case and death figures on that given day. For example, data shown for 25th March presents the latest figures as of 10am CET on 25th March.
Our World in Data relies on this data and we make it accessible via our various visualizations in the COVID-19 page.
Total confirmed cases: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/total_cases.csv
Total deaths: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/total_deaths.csv
New confirmed cases: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/new_cases.csv
New deaths: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/new_deaths.csv
World Health Organization (WHO) Situation Reports – our previous data source
We previously relied on the World Health Organization (WHO) as our single data source as they are the international agency with the mandate to provide official estimates on the pandemic.
Below we have kept data files of this WHO data (which are freely available to download) and noted inconsistencies in their published reports for reference. As of 17th March 2020, we are not updating these files of cases and deaths from WHO data.
The main section of the Situations Reports are long tables of the latest number of confirmed cases and confirmed deaths by country.
In published WHO Situation Reports were several inconsistencies in the number of total confirmed cases, and new confirmed cases that we noticed between the WHO Situation Reports and the WHO Dashboard, which also presents these statistics. These discrepancies are detailed below.
We have informed the WHO about these inconsistencies and are working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) in an effort to resolve these issues. We continue to be in close contact with the WHO data team to ensure the latest statistics are presented accurately.
The inconsistencies are small and do not affect the overall perspective on the development of COVID-19 in a major way, but errors were too frequent and this was the second reason why we stopped to rely on the WHO data.
Total confirmed cases: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/who/total_cases.csv
Total deaths: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/who/total_deaths.csv
New confirmed cases: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/who/new_cases.csv
New deaths: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/who/new_deaths.csv
Reported are 33 confirmed cases
We assume this is a typographical error, and the correct figure for 5th February is 23 confirmed cases.
Globally 101,927 confirmed cases (80,813 confirmed cases in China, and 21,100 confirmed cases Outside of China). But 80,813 + 21,100 does not equal 101,927.
If we take numbers from the actual tables below, the number of cases Outside of China is 21,114. This would give us the correct 101,927 cases globally.
The report details 7 confirmed cases (3 new cases)
But Situation Report 47 (for the previous day) details 5 confirmed cases.
So if there were actually 3 new cases, the confirmed cases would be 8.
We consulted the WHO Dashboard which also says 7 confirmed cases, so we assume it is the new cases number which is incorrect.
The Situation Report says 7 confirmed cases (2 new cases).
But Situation Report 47 (the previous day) details 8 confirmed cases.
The WHO Dashboard details 8 confirmed cases (3 new).
Situation Report details 4 confirmed cases (0 new cases)
But Situation Report 47 (the previous day) details 2 confirmed cases.
The WHO dashboard reports 6 confirmed cases for several days now.
Situation Report details 61 confirmed cases (0 new cases)
But Situation Report 50 (the previous day) details 55 confirmed cases
According to the WHO dashboard, Guyana has 7 total confirmed cases (meaning 1 new case)
Situation Report details 3 total deaths (0 new)
However, the previous day’s report (Report 54) detailed 4 total deaths (1 new)
According to the WHO dashboard, Lebanon has 4 total deaths
We have therefore assumed correct figure for 15th March to be 4 total deaths
Global:
The two errors above affect the global totals for both cases and deaths:
The increase in case numbers for Guyana takes the global total to 153,523 confirmed cases (not 153,517 cases as detailed in the report)
The increase in death numbers for Lebanon takes the global total to 5736 deaths (not 5735 deaths as detailed in the report)
Situation Report details 5 total deaths (0 new)
However, the previous day’s report (Report 55) detailed 3 deaths
This would imply 2 new deaths for 16th March
Situation Report details 12 total deaths (0 new)
However, the previous day’s report (Report 55) detailed 6 deaths
This would imply 6 new deaths for 16th March
Guatemala had its first death reported on 16th March, but is noted as having no new deaths on this day
Situation Report details 3 total deaths (0 new)
However, the previous day’s report (Report 55) detailed 4 deaths
This would imply declining cumulative death numbers
We have left deaths numbers blank for Lebanon for 16th March
Global:
Situation Report details 2503 deaths (349 new)
However, the previous day’s report (Report 56) detailed 1809 deaths
This would imply 694 new deaths for 17th March

Navigating through COVID-19 - Starbucks Stories
Navigating through COVID-19
Starbucks is committed to caring for the health and well-being of our partners and customers and playing a constructive role in supporting local health officials and government leaders. Read about the latest decisions being made by the company and the actions being taken in preparation for COVID-19.
As ceo Kevin Johnson wrote in a letter to customers this week, amid a dynamic and uncertain time, Starbucks store partners around the world have demonstrated the company’s resilience and commitment to the communities they serve. Over the last few weeks, partners have found ways to support those who are keeping our communities safe – particularly responders on the front line of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Starting today through May 3, any customer who identifies as a front-line responder to the COVID-19 outbreak will receive a tall brewed coffee (hot or iced) at no charge.
The Starbucks Foundation will donate $500,000 to support U.S. front-line responders with equal donations to Direct Relief to support the delivery of personal protective equipment and essential medical items and to Operation Gratitude to deliver 50,000 care packages and handwritten letters to first responders and health care workers.
UPDATE ON HOW STARBUCKS IS SUPPORTING PARTNERS AND COMMUNITIES DURING COVID-19
Starbucks continues to take action in responding to COVID-19, on Friday announcing the company would temporarily move to a drive-thru and delivery-only model in the U.S. and Canada and pledging to pay partners until April 19 regardless of whether they go to work.
Today, Starbucks field leaders received a letter from Rossann Williams introducing Starbucks Service Pay for those partners who are able and choose to continue to come to work. Read more about this and other current Starbucks partner benefits during COVID-19, here.
In a letter to all U.S. partners today, Starbucks announced its company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada will move to a drive-thru-only model for at least two weeks. Some exceptions will be made for those cafes serving in or around hospitals and healthcare centers in our efforts to serve first responders and health care workers. 
To continue best serving first responders and health care workers, there will be some exceptions for cafes serving in or around hospitals and health care centers.
In addition to expanded catastrophe pay, Starbucks continues to offer mental health and sick pay benefits, childcare support and more.
“The magnitude of managing through this situation is the single biggest challenge many of us have faced in our lifetime, and I am continually moved by your compassion for each other, our customers and our communities during this exceptionally difficult time. With daily news from friends and family members getting laid off and businesses closing, we need one another more than ever. We need to be a different kind of company,” Williams wrote. “Together, we have successfully navigated many challenges throughout our history, and managing COVID-19 will be no different. You have my word, we will continue to stay true to Our Mission and Values, making the right decisions even when it’s hard, and caring for you and our customers.”
In a letter to all U.S. partners today, Starbucks shared changes the company is implementing to encourage social distancing, in an effort to help contain the COVID-19 virus.  
“As we all know, the situation with COVID-19 is extremely dynamic and we will continue to review the facts and science and make the proactive decisions necessary to protect our partners, customers and communities,” wrote Rossann Williams, executive vice president and president, U.S. company-operated business and Canada.
Williams continues, “Every community’s needs are incredibly different. We want to make sure we play a constructive role by taking responsible actions, in partnership with the CDC and local public health authorities, so we can continue to do what’s right for our partners and customers.”
Today’s announcement builds on a foundation set by Starbucks chief executive officer Kevin Johnson last week in a letter sharing how the company has been preparing to respond quickly to COVID-19 emerging situations.  
KEVIN JOHNSON, STARBUCKS CEO, OUTLINES STEPS COMPANY IS TAKING FOR HEALTH OF CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY
Starbucks chief executive officer Kevin Johnson wrote a letter to customers today detailing precautionary steps the company has already taken in response to COVID-19 and letting them know about changes they might see going forward.
“We appreciate your understanding that, as a customer, your Starbucks Experience may look different as we navigate through this time together,” he wrote. “While we are currently maintaining regular operations across the U.S. and Canada, our stores are prepared to modify operations with options that still allow us to serve you your favorite beverage and food. This means that as we navigate this dynamic situation community-by-community and store-by-store, we may adapt the store experience by limiting seating to improve social distancing, enable mobile order-only scenarios for pickup via the Starbucks App or delivery via Uber Eats, or in some cases only the Drive Thru will be open. As a last resort, we will close a store if we feel it is in the best interest of our customers and partners, or if we are directed to do so by government authorities. In any such situation, we expect store disruption to be temporary.” 
STARBUCKS WILL OFFER FULL SUPPORT TO PARTNERS, INCLUDING CATASTROPHE PAY AND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES
Starbucks partners who are sick or need to be quarantined won’t have to choose between working or taking care of themselves, wrote Rossann Williams, evp and president, U.S. company-operated business and Canada. It is one of a number of resources being offered to partners during the COVID-19 outbreak, detailed in an open letter published Wednesday.
“You have our full support when it comes to partner care, including access to catastrophe pay, benefits that support your physical and mental health, as well as a network of partners who are all here to help,” she wrote.
In addition to existing benefits such as sick pay and personal time off, the company will offer catastrophe pay to any partner who has been diagnosed with or exposed to COVID-19 or comes in close prolonged contact with someone in their store or household who has. It also will be available to partners experiencing symptoms, even if they haven’t been in known contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, and to those who may need to take extra precautions, such as those 60 years or older or who have underlying health conditions. The full catastrophe pay benefit is for 14 days, but if partners are still unable to return to work, additional pay replacement may be made up to 26 weeks, she wrote.
Partners can also access other resources such as a range of mental health benefits including free counseling through the Employee Assistance Program and Headspace for mindfulness and meditation. Another resource is the company’s CUP Fund, which provides grants for partners experiencing financial hardship.
STARBUCKS JOINS SEATTLE BUSINESS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES THROUGH COVID-19
Continuing to navigate the coronavirus situation, today Starbucks joined a coalition of philanthropy, government and business partners to create a COVID-19 Response Fund in Seattle. This fund is designed to help rapidly deploy resources to help local organizations on the front lines of the outbreak who are helping the most vulnerable in the community.
For the last few weeks, Starbucks has been preparing for the possible scenarios related to COVID-19 and ensuring the right plans and resources are in place, defined principally by guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local public health authorities, including increased cleaning and sanitizing for all company-operated stores to help prevent the spread of all germs.
Today,  Rossann Williams, executive vice president, president U.S. company-operated business and Canada shared details of how processes and protocols were put into practice in Seattle, following a confirmed case of COVID-19 in one of our stores.
STARBUCKS OUTLINES PRECAUTIONARY STEPS DURING COVID-19 OUTBREAK
We are taking guidance from the CDC and local health authorities, we have increased cleaning and sanitizing for all company-operated stores to help prevent the spread of all germs, adding paid time for our partners supporting this work.
We have provided scenario-based procedural information to our store teams on how to report and support anyone that may express they’ve been impacted by the virus, including store closure decision making support.

Officials confirm Georgia’s first 2 cases of coronavirus
Two people who live in the same household in Fulton County are the first in Georgia to test positive for the new coronavirus, Gov. Brian Kemp and state officials announced Monday evening at a hastily arranged press conference. 
The two showed symptoms of the illness shortly after one of the people returned to Georgia from a trip to the northern Italian city of Milan, officials said. 
» THE LATEST: Complete coverage of coronavirus in Georgia
Dr. Kathleen Toomey, head of the state’s public health department, said the patient who recently traveled to Italy detected the illness quickly, and “astutely” consulted medical officials. She described the symptoms as “mild.” 
“I want to reassure you that they’re at home, in home isolation with other household members, with minimal symptoms so they’re not hospitalized,” she said. 
State health officials have long braced for the possibility of local cases of the virus, which has infected nearly 90,000 people worldwide. More than 90 confirmed cases of the disease have been reported in the U.S., including six fatalities, as the virus spreads despite efforts to contain it. 
The illness, known as COVID-19, is characterized by fever and coughing and, sometimes, pneumonia and shortness of breath. Most of the cases have been in China, where roughly 80,000 have been sickened and at least 2,800 people have died.
But it continues to spread globally and the total of confirmed cases outside of China has surpassed 7,000 cases in 58 countries. Flights have been canceled, travelers have been quarantined and lives turned upside down. 
The governor urged people who are exhibiting symptoms to call their medical provider, which “is exactly what happened in this case.” 
Officials said the patient who returned from Italy alerted a clinician of symptoms, was kept from the medical facility’s waiting room and submitted a specimen that the CDC tested on Saturday. The results were returned Monday evening, officials said. 
State health officials said they are not providing details about the couple, including their names, ages or flight information, to protect their privacy.

Kemp on Friday named a task force made up of several of his administration’s top deputies, along with health and school officials, to identify the best ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in Georgia.
And President Donald Trump is set to visit the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday as he tries to calm growing fears about the outbreak. He’s also issued new restrictions on foreign travel and warned that additional cases of the illness are “likely.” 
The virus has already disrupted lives in Georgia. 
The Georgia Department of Public Health hasn’t disclosed the number of people in Georgia tested for coronavirus.

Until now, self-quarantines in Georgia have only applied to residents who recently traveled to China. Toomey said state health officials were not receiving lists of passengers from other countries including Italy. But she said authorities are working diligently to identify those who might have been in contact with the two people testing positive for the virus in Atlanta.
The state’s efforts to test for the disease have been complicated by a major glitch in testing. The Georgia Public Health Lab recently received a flawed diagnostic kit from federal officials, meaning that all testing must be at the CDC.
The agency is awaiting new test kits from the CDC, said state health department spokeswoman Nancy Nydam, and it should soon be able to conduct a quality assessment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also said it will allow hundreds of labs to test for the virus.
The CDC has also expanded guidelines for coronavirus testing to include people with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath coupled with travel not only to China but also other high-risk areas including Italy, Iran, and South Korea.
The governor said he briefed Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House’s response to the disease, about Georgia’s two cases.

New York City's Javits Center transforming into field hospital for coronavirus patients
Conversion of the main showroom floor of the Javits Center in Manhattan is expected to begin this week, turning the 1.8 million square feet of convention space into New York City's first field hospital to respond to the coronavirus crisis, CBS New York reports.
Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the plans Saturday and toured the space Monday afternoon. He said setting up four 250-bed field hospitals at the site would take about a week to 10 days.

"You're going to see an over-capacity of our health system," he said. "Right now we're projecting you'll see more people come into the health care system than we can handle."
In addition to the initial 1,000 beds being made available, Cuomo said an additional 1,000 beds for "lighter medical care" could also be built within the Javits Center, a venue that until known has been known for events like auto shows and comic cons, not medical care.
A map of the the field hospital arrangement is seen inside the Javits Center in Manhattan on March 23, 2020. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that he is converting the convention center to help care for a surge in coronavirus cases.
Other locations Cuomo put on his list as field hospital sites included the campuses at SUNY Stony Brook and SUNY Westbury on Long Island, and the Westchester Convention Center, north of New York City. Each of those would have one 250-bed unit under the management of FEMA.
New York is facing the largest number of people infected with coronavirus in the U.S., with more than 12,000 confirmed cases as of Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
In Cuomo's earlier press briefing Monday, he urged retired health care professionals to lend their hands in response to the pandemic by enlisting online.
The Senate raced to respond to the coronavirus pandemic with an economic stabilization package, and lawmakers braced for potential travel restrictions.

How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.
What makes this outbreak so different?
Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.

Iran’s Coronavirus Response: Pride, Paranoia, Secrecy, Chaos
Iranian leaders once predicted the coronavirus epidemic ravaging China would not affect their country. Now Iran has among the most coronavirus deaths outside China, and Iranian medical workers have been told to keep quiet.
An Iranian medic treating a patient infected with coronavirus at a hospital in Tehran on Sunday.
Nearly three dozen Iranian government officials and members of parliament are infected and a senior adviser to the supreme leader has died.
The Health Ministry has proposed sending 300,000 militia members door-to-door on a desperate mission to sanitize homes. The top prosecutor has warned that anyone hoarding face masks and other public health equipment risks the death penalty.
Iran’s leaders confidently predicted just two weeks ago that the coronavirus contagion ravaging China would not be a problem in their country. They even bragged of exporting face masks to their Chinese trading partners.
Now Iran is battered by coronavirus infections that have killed 77 people, among the most outside of China, officials said Tuesday. But instead of receiving government help, overwhelmed doctors and nurses say they have been warned by security forces to keep quiet. And some officials say Tehran’s hierarchy is understating the true extent of the outbreak — probably, experts contend, because it will be viewed as a failure that enemies will exploit.
As the world wrestles with the spread of the coronavirus, the epidemic in Iran is a lesson in what happens when a secretive state with limited resources tries to play down an outbreak, and then finds it very difficult to contain.
The authorities seem as worried about controlling information as they are about controlling the virus, according to telephone interviews and text messages with more than a half dozen Iranian medical workers.
Several said security agents stationed in each hospital had forbidden staff members from disclosing any information about shortages, patients or fatalities related to the coronavirus.
A nurse in a northwest Iranian city sent a private message to her family — later shared with The New York Times — describing a letter from the security service warning that sharing information about infected patients constitutes a “threat to national security” and “public fear mongering.” Such offenses “will be swiftly dealt with by a disciplinary committee,” the nurse said the letter had warned.
The secrecy and paranoia, doctors and other experts say, reflects what they call a counterproductive focus on Iran’s public image and prestige that appears to be damaging public trust and hindering more practical steps at containment.
A prominent pathologist in Tehran said laboratory staff members testing for the coronavirus were told that they had been threatened with interrogation and arrest if they provided information to the news media.

“Disgraceful,” the pathologist said in a telephone interview. “By turning this into a national security issue, they are putting more pressure and stress on doctors and medical teams and creating an environment of chaos and fear.”
In northern Iran’s Golestan Province — where Iran has acknowledged about two dozen infections — the top health official railed in a news conference on Sunday about his frustration with Tehran’s refusal to acknowledge the extent of the epidemic.
“We were screaming at the health ministry that we have 594 corona patients but the ministry was telling us since you don’t have positive test results we won’t give you equipment you need,” the official, Dr. Abdulreza Fazel, complained. “They kept saying, ‘wait, wait, wait,’ and then suddenly they announce you are an epicenter.”
The virus, which first appeared in China in late 2019, has struck Iran at a moment of particular vulnerability for its leadership.
Iran’s economy has been hobbled by American sanctions. Its security forces have struggled to repress a wave of public protests. Its military has reeled from the assassination of a revered Iranian military commander by an American drone. Domestic credibility of the authorities may have reached a new low with the begrudging admission after days of denials that their own air defenses had mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet full of Iranian passengers.
“They are lurching from crisis to crisis and trying to Band-Aid each crisis,” said Sanam Vakil, a researcher on Iran at Chatham House, a London-based research institute. “They underestimated the potential effect of the coronavirus.”
Iranian health officials initially boasted of their public health prowess. They ridiculed quarantines as “archaic” and portrayed Iran as a global role model. President Hassan Rouhani suggested a week ago that by this past Saturday life would have returned to normal.
Instead, Iran on Tuesday acknowledged as many as 77 deaths from the virus and at least 2,300 cases of infection. But medical experts say the 77 deaths suggested that, based on the expected death rate, about 4,000 people are presumably infected.

Because of those shortages, the reality is that no one can guess how far the coronavirus has spread in Iran. One Canadian study projected a week ago that the true total of infections may have been more than 18,000, “and a week ago is eons when we are talking about an epidemic,” said Isaac Bogoch, a Toronto doctor who was one of the authors.
The roster of current or former senior official sickened in the contagion includes a vice president, the deputy health minister and 23 members of parliament. On Monday, Iranian state media reported that at least one official had even died from the virus: Mohammad Mirmohammadi, 71, a member of the Expediency Council, which advises Iran’s supreme leader.
Embarrassed anew by the spread of the disease, the Iranian authorities have responded with a hodgepodge of contradictory measures mixing elements of a crackdown with attempts to save face.
The nation’s top prosecutor has threatened to execute anyone who hoards face masks or other supplies — an acknowledgment of the problem.
The health minister, Saeed Namaki, on Sunday announced a plan to dispatch a force of 300,000 plainclothes Basij militiamen that would go house to house to screen residents and disinfect their homes.
Iranian doctors and politicians immediately criticized the plan, saying that untrained militiamen were more likely to spread the virus than to contain it.
“The borders of mismanagement and ignorance are being rapidly redrawn by the health ministry,” Dr. Omid Rezaie, a prominent oncologist in Tehran, wrote on Telegram, the social media channel. “I feel sorry for us because we are sitting in a sinking boat that you are managing.”
The streets of Tehran, the capital, are deserted as panicky residents stick to their homes for fear of contagion. But in the holy city of Qom, the site of the first and most significant outbreak in Iran, mosques and shrines are still holding mass worship services for visiting pilgrims despite the Health Ministry’s advice.
“Frankly, the unwillingness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to restrict large-scale visits to these shrines is criminal in the case of this illness,” said Amir A. Afkhami, a medical doctor and historian at George Washington University who has studied the Iranian response to previous epidemics.
Dr. Mohsen Basiri, an Iranian physician now in Houston, said that in a conference call on Sunday about emergency supplies his colleagues in Iran had said that security agents forced doctors to fill out false certificates for deaths that appeared to be coronavirus, ascribing them instead to lung or heart failure in order to avoid acknowledging fatalities linked to the epidemic.
“They don’t have the means, equipment, money, management or trust of the public to combat an epidemic of this scope,” Dr. Basiri said.
At least two Iranian lawmakers have publicly raised similar claims that the authorities are seeking to hide fatalities from the coronavirus by listing other causes on death certificates.
Gholamali Jaffarzadeh Imanabadi, a lawmaker from Gilan Province near the Caspian Sea, told the Iranian news media on Monday that more than 20 people in his constituency had died, hospitals had reached full capacity and the designated center for treatment of the virus was now turning away patients. In some cases, he also claimed, the local authorities had recorded an alternate cause of death for the victims.
“Based on the numbers, testimonies and proof that we have received, the number of dead and infected people is far higher than what is announced,” he complained, calling the official figures “a joke.”
Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, a lawmaker from Qom, raised similar complaints last week, saying in a Twitter posting that staff at two hospitals were falsifying death certificates to minimize the epidemic.
“The doctors at Kamkar and Foghani hospitals are writing that cause of death is respiratory failure,” Mr. Farahani wrote, “but they know very well that the deaths are happening in the coronavirus quarantine ward.”
A spokesman for the Health Ministry disputed those accusations, suggesting that any discrepancy between local estimates and the official numbers might reflect only a time lag during backup testing to confirm infections. The spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said the ministry double-checks results before adding them to the official tally.
Others complained that sheer shortages of testing kits and other equipment may be contributing to an undercount. “There is no testing kit, disinfectants and preventive equipment available in our country that can match the rapid spread of this disease,” Bahram Parsaei, a lawmaker from Shiraz, said in a Twitter posting on Sunday. “This is why reality is far more than the official numbers.”
Iran has prided itself for decades on the strength of the public health system, said Dr. Afkhami, the author of a book about Iran’s past response to epidemics. As recently as 2008, he said, Iran had acted effectively to avert a cholera epidemic from neighboring countries, partly by banning the sale of fresh vegetables and street foods in certain areas.
This time, though, Iran’s health authorities appeared to have let their guard down, he said.
Then Tehran boasted of having sent supplies of domestically produced hospital masks to China, depleting Iranian supplies as other countries were quietly stockpiling their own. Now, Dr. Afkhami said, “its shortage of face masks is self-inflicted.”

The Coronavirus Outbreak
A cruise liner bound for San Francisco from Hawaii is believed to be linked to two coronavirus cases, one of them fatal. More cases were found in a number of states, including Texas and New Jersey.
This briefing has ended. Read the latest news and analysis about the coronavirus outbreak here.
Gov. Gavin Newsom spoke last month at the California Department of Public Health. He announced a state of emergency in the state on Wednesday.
A cruise ship bound for California is believed linked to the first U.S. death outside Washington State.
Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Wednesday that a cruise ship returning to California from Hawaii that had suspected links to two coronavirus cases, one of them fatal, was being held off the coast of San Francisco, as public health officials prepared to screen everyone on the ship.
Eleven passengers and 10 crew members on the boat were showing symptoms on Wednesday, the governor said. “That number may significantly understate” the scope of infection, he said, or “it may indeed be abundance of caution.”
[Read: Failures on the Diamond Princess shadow another cruise ship outbreak.]
The governor also announced that the state was declaring a state of emergency to help mobilize its response to the coronavirus outbreak. The number of cases in the state shot up to 54 on Wednesday, the most in the nation.
Governor Newsom said that about 2,500 people, more than half of them Californians, had been aboard the ship, identified by its owners as the Grand Princess, during a recent voyage from San Francisco to Mexico. One of those passengers died Wednesday in Placer County, Calif., the first U.S. coronavirus death outside Washington State and the 11th overall. Another passenger was being treated for the illness in Sonoma County. State and federal officials were racing to contact others who had been on board.
The person who died in Placer County had underlying health conditions and had been in isolation at a hospital after falling ill. Officials believe the patient was probably exposed to the virus on the San Francisco-to-Mexico leg of the voyage last month.
Health officials in Los Angeles County announced six new cases on Wednesday, and Santa Clara County announced three more cases. The virus has been detected across the United States, but so far has been concentrated on the West Coast.
A person who conducted medical screenings at Los Angeles International Airport tested positive for the virus, the Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday. The person last worked at the airport on Feb. 21, eight days before showing symptoms of infection, the agency said.
Each of the six new cases reported by Los Angeles County was linked to a known exposure, a history of international travel or contact with someone who had traveled or been diagnosed with the virus, officials said.
Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak
The virus has infected more than 672,500 people in at least 171 countries.
A Facebook contractor in Seattle has tested positive for the virus.
Facebook on Wednesday said that a  worker in the company’s Seattle offices tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, making it the second major tech company in the city to be affected by the outbreak.
The tech industry is vital to the economy of Washington State, where a cluster of infections has taken root and 10 people have died, leading companies there to take extra measures to halt the spread of the virus.
“A contractor based in our Stadium East office has been diagnosed with Covid-19,” said Andy Stone, a company spokesman. “We’ve notified our employees and are following the advice of public health officials to prioritize everyone’s health and safety.”
The contractor was last in the office on Friday, Feb. 21, the company said. The Seattle office would be closed for three weeks. As an extra precaution, Facebook asked its Seattle-based employees to work from home until the end of March.
On Tuesday, Amazon told employees via email that a worker in one of its many office buildings in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood had tested positive for the virus.
Latest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak

U.S. lawmakers reach a deal on an $8.3 billion emergency coronavirus bill.
Racing to confront a growing public health threat, key lawmakers in the House and Senate reached a deal on Wednesday to provide $8.3 billion in emergency aid to combat the novel coronavirus. The House voted Wednesday to approve it, and the Senate was expected to take it up on Thursday.
The bipartisan package came together after days of rapid negotiations. It includes nearly $7.8 billion for agencies dealing with the virus, substantially more than the White House initially proposed in late February.
It also authorizes roughly $500 million to allow Medicare providers to administer tele-health services, so that more elderly patients, who are at greater risk from the virus, can receive care at home, according to two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of a formal announcement.
Against medical advice, a man socialized at Dartmouth while awaiting a test result. It came back positive.
An employee at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire who showed signs of possible coronavirus infection was told by a medical worker last week to avoid contact with other people, pending test results.
Instead, the man who had flu-like symptoms after a trip to Italy, attended a mixer for doctors and Dartmouth College students. Three days later, he was confirmed as the state’s first coronavirus case. A “close contact” of the man has since tested positive as well.
The episode heightened concerns about people who ignore requests to self-quarantine. The state health commissioner has now made the request a formal order.
“The general vibe is we are all pretty concerned that this medical professional showed up to the event, despite being told to self-isolate,” said Christie Harrison, a first-year Tuck student who sang with the band that performed at the mixer.
Another death in Washington State, and several new infections.
A tenth person in Washington State has died from the coronavirus and several new infections have been confirmed, officials said on Wednesday, as ramped-up testing offered troubling evidence of how widely the virus had spread.
The Seattle area was grappling to contain a worsening crisis that has seen the virus overrun a suburban nursing home, killing at least seven residents. Ten of the 11 confirmed U.S. deaths so far have occurred in Washington, and all have been reported in the last few days.
The region’s medical resources are “under incredible stress right now,” said Patty Hayes, director of public health for Seattle and King County. “We need to slow the spread of disease to the point where our health care system can continue to handle the load.”
The county executive, Dow Constantine, said officials are recommending that older residents with underlying health problems stay home, that employers have workers telecommute, and that community organizations cancel events with more than 10 people.

Washington had its first confirmed coronavirus case in January, but officials had not found any others until late last week; expanded testing in recent days has identified dozens of infections.
On Tuesday, officials announced that the virus had killed two people a week ago, suggesting that the illness had spread in the Seattle area days earlier than was previously known.
A high school in Renton, a Seattle suburb, was closed on Wednesday through the end of the week, after a student tested positive for the virus.
The C.D.C. greatly expands the pool of people who can be tested, to include anyone with symptoms.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday broadened the guidelines for coronavirus testing, allowing doctors to order a test for any patients who have symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing.
Doctors were encouraged to first rule out other causes of respiratory illness, like influenza, and to take into consideration whether there are other local coronavirus cases, officials said.
Even so, the new standard greatly expands the pool of patients who qualify for testing, though the laboratory capacity to process the tests remains limited. The change could relieve some of the frustration of patients and doctors who have been denied access to the test when they thought it was warranted.
Previous guidelines required a patient to have symptoms of respiratory illness as well as a clear risk factor for exposure, like recent travel to China or a number of other affected countries, contact with a known coronavirus patient, or hospitalization with a severe and unexplained respiratory illness.

Experts said they feared a rush by the worried well who may flood the health care system, just as new private and hospital labs are gearing up for testing.
The federal government had promised to ramp up testing, but some companies and public health officials cast doubt on the government’s assurances. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that the labs currently could handle 15,000 tests a day, though that figure was expected to grow.
With his administration under fire for its handling of the outbreak, President Trump sought to deflect criticism onto his predecessor on Wednesday, complaining that a federal regulation adopted under President Barack Obama made it harder to do widespread testing for the virus.
He appeared to be referring to a regulation that limited the ability of laboratories run by states, universities and private companies to conduct medical screenings not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. On Saturday, the F.D.A. commissioner, Stephen M. Hahn, allowed those labs to use coronavirus tests they had developed independently, after submitting evidence that the tests work.
The government has stumbled several times in trying to keep up with the demand for coronavirus tests. Local health agencies and doctors have complained that a lack of tests have hindered their abilities to identify patients.
The C.D.C. at first maintained tight control on test production, and some of the early tests it sent to state health departments were defective.
Nine people connected to the man who was confirmed as New York’s second case of the new coronavirus have all tested positive for the illness, state officials said on Wednesday.
The new cases included the man’s wife; his son, 20; his daughter, 14; and a neighbor in New Rochelle, N.Y., a Westchester County suburb, who drove the man to the hospital. A friend of the man who spent time “in close proximity” with him also tested positive for the virus, as did that man’s wife and three of their children, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said.
The discovery that the Westchester father, a man of about 50 who works with his wife at a law firm in Manhattan, had the illness set off a search by health officials across the region to determine whether he had infected others, and who might have infected him. So far, about 1,000 people were being asked to self-quarantine, Mr. Cuomo estimated.
The governor said that about 300 students and faculty members from various State University of New York and City University campuses who are in China, Italy, Japan, Iran, or South Korea — countries where the illness is raging — have been asked to return to New York, and remain in quarantine for two weeks.

The New York authorities announced the state’s first confirmed case of the virus on Sunday, saying that a health care worker had been infected in Iran. She began exhibiting symptoms after returning home but had kept herself largely isolated. Her husband has tested negative for the virus, Mr. Cuomo said.
Italy surpasses 3,000 cases and 100 deaths, as virus continues to spread fast in Europe.
In Italy, site of by far the biggest outbreak in Europe, the number of infections and deaths surged again on Wednesday, and the country ordered all schools shut down from Thursday until at least March 15.
The number of deaths in Italy that the government has attributed to the coronavirus jumped from 79 on Tuesday to 107 on Wednesday — more than in any country but China, where the epidemic began. Italy’s people are the oldest in Europe — 23 percent of the population is 65 or over — and most of the victims have been elderly.
Italian officials reported 3,089 people infected so far — up more than 400 from Tuesday — a figure surpassed only in China and South Korea. Italy has 295 coronavirus patients in intensive care, and the health care system in parts of Lombardy, the northern region that has been hardest hit, is straining under the burden.
The authorities put two more towns under lockdown on Wednesday, raising the total to 13.
Just as many of the early outbreaks around the world traced back to travel in China, many others, particularly in Europe, are linked to travel in Italy.
The next-largest outbreaks on the continent are in France, with 285 cases reported by Wednesday; Germany, with 240; and Spain, with 193. One of the sharpest increases was in Britain, which reported 87 cases, up from 51 on Tuesday. Poland recorded its first infection, in a person who had recently traveled to Germany.
In Spain, officials said they believe the death from pneumonia of a 69-year-old man in Valencia on Feb. 13 was the earliest known fatality in Europe connected to Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.
The announcement suggests that the virus was circulating in Spain earlier than previously believed.
The virus is deadlier than the seasonal flu but may not transmit as easily, the W.H.O. says.
Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is much deadlier than seasonal flu but may not spread as easily, World Health Organization officials have reiterated.
But their statements also reinforced how much efforts to quantify the epidemic remain little more than rough estimates.
Among people who catch seasonal flus, about 0.1 to 0.2 percent die from the illness, though the number varies widely from year to year, depending on the strain of the virus and other factors. It has been apparent since January that the new virus had a significantly higher fatality rate — though lower than those of other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS.
“Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported Covid-19 cases have died,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general, said on Tuesday at a news conference in Geneva.
But the figure came loaded with caveats. Experts, including those at the W.H.O., say that when more is known about the epidemic, the death rate will be considerably lower.
The death rate Dr. Tedros cited does not include mild cases that were not detected because people did not seek medical attention. And it primarily reflects the experience in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the epidemic began — and where the numbers soared before China’s medical systems had gathered the knowledge and marshaled the resources to fight it.
Earlier estimates of the mortality rate in China had been closer to 2 percent.
Dr. Bruce Aylward, who is leading the W.H.O.’s coronavirus efforts, said he expects that ultimately, it will turn out to be between 1 and 2 percent. And it could be below 1 percent, according Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. H. Clifford Lane, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the C.D.C.
The extent and mortality of the epidemic will not be known with great accuracy until a reliable test is developed for the antibodies present in people who have been infected, and that test is administered to large numbers of people.
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.
‘When Is It Going to End?’: Where Coronavirus Has Turned Deadly in the U.S.
Four residents of a nursing care facility in suburban Seattle have died, and the surrounding community is taking extraordinary steps to contain the virus.
Equipment was delivered to the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Wash., on Monday. Several of the deaths from coronavirus in the United States have been tied to the facility.
SEATTLE — Movie nights have been canceled. Residents are restricted to their rooms, their meals delivered by workers in protective gear. Ambulances come and go, taking elderly patients who have fallen ill to the hospital two miles away.
Life Care Center, which advertises a “homelike and welcoming atmosphere” in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, has become the focal point of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Four of the six people who have died of the virus in this country were residents of the 190-bed nursing care facility. Several other residents and at least one employee have tested positive. One-quarter of the city’s firefighters are in quarantine as a result of recent visits, and officials said on Monday that some have developed flu-like symptoms.
Her mother has shown no symptoms, Ms. Delosangeles has been told, but that has not eliminated her concern. “Is it going to get way worse before it gets better? Are we going to be plagued with this problem for the next several months?”
On Monday, Washington State reported four fatalities associated with the coronavirus, bringing the death toll in the United States to six — all in Washington — and raising concerns that the cluster of cases in the Pacific Northwest could presage a much wider outbreak.
Across the region, leaders began taking extraordinary steps to contain the virus. Residents were warned to prepare for significant changes to their daily lives.
After declaring a state of emergency, King County officials announced highly unusual plans to purchase a motel that could be converted into an isolation center for people who get sick.
A school district canceled classes for more than 23,000 students on Tuesday to train employees on how to teach children remotely, should the outbreak worsen.
Dr. Jeff Duchin, King County’s health officer, said a sudden uptick in infections in the state — 18 cases have been reported in Washington since Friday — indicates that coronavirus infections will likely surpass the flu in the coming weeks, straining the health care system. Eventually, he said, officials will have to shift their focus from individual cases to the most pressing clusters of people who are ill.
Dr. Chris Spitters, the health officer for neighboring Snohomish County, said officials there would consider a range of potential ways to contain the outbreak, including strategies that could expand to discourage or prohibit mass gatherings such as sporting events.

In the United States, 103 cases have been reported of the virus, which has left more than 3,000 people dead worldwide and sickened tens of thousands of others. In at least a dozen of the Washington cases, officials have said they were unaware of any connection to overseas travel that might explain the origin.
Health experts said that the increase in cases suggested that the virus has been spreading within the United States for a while, and would likely continue.
“The question is, is this a kind of local outbreak, or is this the first signature of a much larger outbreak?” said Aubree Gordon, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health. “I think it’s going to be very important that local public health officials and the government react quickly and appropriately to try to stop the spread.”
Since the nation’s first coronavirus case was found in Washington six weeks ago, health officials have conducted sporadic testing, limited by narrow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for who was at risk, as well as difficulties with testing kits.
On Monday, the state increased its testing and was now handling about 200 requests each day, said Dr. Kathy Lofy, the health officer of Washington State. Much of the focus has been in the Seattle area, but Dr. Lofy said that could change. “Given the movement of people around the state, it is possible the virus is spreading in other counties, too,” she said.
Dow Constantine, the executive of King County, where officials were trying to buy a motel as a possible isolation facility, said it could be open as early as the end of the week. He said he also hoped to repurpose modular housing units, initially destined for the region’s homeless crisis, to be used to help isolate people and free up space at medical centers.
“We need that hospital capacity for treatment,” Mr. Constantine said.
Still more troubling news followed on Saturday: A resident and an employee had tested positive for coronavirus.
“We now know the virus is active in our community,” Michelle Reid, the superintendent of the Northshore district, wrote a letter to families sent late Sunday.
And at the University of Washington, more than 11,000 people have signed a petition calling for the school to close its Seattle campus, which has roughly 46,000 students. “In classrooms, dining halls and during other crowded areas, the virus will inevitably infect people thus increasing the infection rate exponentially,” the petition reads.
“We absolutely understand the anxiety that is coming as a result of these reports in the region,” he said, “but we have been following and are continuing to follow the guidance issued by public health authorities.”
The Coronavirus Outbreak
Close to a Million Coronavirus Tests Could Be Ready in U.S. This Week
Looser regulations on who can develop tests for the virus will allow for a significant increase in the number of Americans likely to be screened, the F.D.A. commissioner said.
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Monday that it could have the capacity for nearly a million tests for the coronavirus by the end of this week, as the government prepares to escalate screening as the American death toll reached six and U.S. infections topped 100.
Private companies and academic laboratories have been pulled in to develop and validate their own coronavirus tests, a move to get around a government bottleneck after a halting start, and to widen the range and number of Americans screened for the virus, Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said Monday at a White House briefing.
The testing expansion comes as the world moves in a more coordinated fashion to confront the virus and its threat to health and the global economy. The Group of 7 industrialized nations is expected to hold an emergency call on Tuesday to synchronize a multinational effort to stimulate economic growth, the first such effort since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.
But the virus’s spread was gaining speed, exceeding 90,000 infections and 3,000 deaths worldwide. An expansion of testing in the United States would undoubtedly raise the number of confirmed infections, administration officials said. King County, Wash., where four residents of a single nursing home have died, declared an emergency on Monday, and with more than a dozen schools in the region closed, the virus’s effect was beginning to be felt more broadly.
“We expect to have a substantial increase in the number of tests this week, next week and throughout the month,” Dr. Hahn said, flanked by Vice President Mike Pence and top federal health officials.
Dr. Hahn’s initial comments caused some confusion about the number of tests that would be administered by the end of the week, but the administration clarified that he was speaking of the capacity for increased testing, not the number of Americans that would be tested. That number is still unknown.
White House officials tried to project calm. “The risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low,” Mr. Pence, who oversees the Trump administration’s coronavirus efforts, told reporters at the White House.
Those reassurances contrasted with warnings delivered on Monday by top officials across the federal government. Officials at the F.D.A. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told congressional staff that the coronavirus death rate “won’t be as bad as the Spanish flu of 1918,” which killed as many as 50 million people worldwide, according to one person on the call and a person briefed on the discussion.

C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
In the briefing, which was conducted by phone, the officials said that only 337 additional C.D.C. test kits were made available for distribution on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to two people on the call and the person briefed on the discussion who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Each of those tests would cover about 350 people, officials said.
The officials added that they hoped that a private manufacturer could step in and provide 2,500 more kits by the end of the week. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said that public health labs currently can test 15,000 people, and could test up to 75,000 by the end of the week, numbers that fall well short of what Dr. Hahn indicated private labs could handle.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview with NBC on Monday that the virus had “reached outbreak proportions and likely pandemic proportions.”
Yet in several appearances on Monday at the White House, the president continued minimizing the risks of the outbreak.
In an Oval Office meeting with President Iván Duque Márquez of Colombia, Mr. Trump suggested that there could be a “cure” for the new coronavirus. But that assertion has been widely disputed by scientists, who have warned the public that it could linger globally for many years without one, much like the common cold, a closely related illness. The president also claimed that there were “not very many” cases of the coronavirus in the United States.
Later Monday, at a meeting with pharmaceutical executives, Mr. Trump said that “we will continue to do exactly what we’re doing,” even as he hinted that he may announce new travel restrictions from a number of unnamed nations. Mr. Pence said that the Trump administration would screen all travelers on direct flights to the United States from Italy and South Korea, where thousands of coronavirus cases have appeared in recent weeks.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Pence discussed the virus with the nation’s governors, and later joined the president in the meeting with pharmaceutical companies where Mr. Trump said he heard that a vaccine would be ready in three to four months. Dr. Fauci, who was in the room, clarified that deploying a vaccine was at least a year away.
The drug company executives told Mr. Trump that it would still take a year to 18 months to produce a viable vaccine in quantities for widespread use.
“That’s going to require testing periods,” Dr. J. Joseph Kim, the chief executive of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, said in an interview after the White House meeting. “Obviously we’re working at warp speed on this. Just think — we didn’t even have ‘coronavirus’ in our vocabulary until early January.”
Dr. Kim said his firm would begin human trials of a vaccine next month, but it would take until the end of the year or early next year to be ready for the broader public.
“We can produce as much as one million doses by the end of this year using our existing capacity and resources,” he said. “But we need help from the U.S. government and resources it could bring to scale. If we have a successful vaccine, we need to make hundreds of millions of doses.”
Several other companies are also working to develop a vaccine, and one of them, Moderna Therapeutics, said last week that it had delivered its experimental version at a record-setting pace to the National Institutes of Health for early testing in humans, the first drugmaker to do so. Mr. Trump will visit the National Institutes of Health on Tuesday afternoon.
As C.D.C. and F.D.A. officials spoke with congressional staff on Monday afternoon, top lawmakers were rushing to work out an emergency virus spending bill, hoping to pass it before a mid-March break. The legislation, which could be unveiled Tuesday, is expected to be $7 billion to $8 billion.
Lawmakers were also negotiating the possible inclusion of language to ensure vaccine affordability, a demand of Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the two Democratic leaders.
Lawmakers and their offices were also preparing to take additional precautions on Capitol Hill, given the influx of both employees and tourists on a daily basis. Ms. Pelosi invited other congressional leaders — Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader; Mr. Schumer; and Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader — to attend a briefing with Capitol officials on the coronavirus response on Wednesday.
As local officials around the country raced to keep up with the virus’s spread and assess the risk to schools and businesses, public health experts continued criticizing the speed with which the Trump administration has designed a test and permitted states to use one. The C.D.C. at one point had insisted that only its test — and not one developed by the World Health Organization, for example — could be used on suspected cases, and even C.D.C. tests would be administered under limited circumstances.
“In New York State, the person who tested positive was only the 32nd test we’ve done in this state. That is a national scandal,” Dr. Matt McCarthy of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital said on CNBC.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Monday at a news conference that a person-to-person spread of the disease in New York City was “inevitable,” a day after confirming that a Manhattan woman had contracted the virus while in Iran and was now isolated at home.
The plodding pace of federal testing was partly the result of a faulty version of the test kit that the C.D.C. had sent to states, a consequence of scaling up manufacturing. The kit was capable of testing for the coronavirus but falsely identified other viruses.
As of Monday, the agency said it had tested fewer than 500 people for the virus, and the part of its website tracking that number was taken down.
Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said it was clear that the problem around testing at the C.D.C. was much more about leadership than science.
“We have been so focused on keeping the virus out of the country,” she said. “If we truly believed, as many of us have been arguing, that it was highly likely there were already cases in the U.S., I think we would have been asking tougher questions about how we could get testing capacity online.”
Restrictions on testing have severely constrained local health departments, which were desperate to catch up with and contain the spread. Dow Constantine, the executive of King County, Wash., said the county was preparing to buy a motel in the Seattle area where people who were infected with the coronavirus could stay to remain isolated.
On Saturday, the F.D.A. said that hundreds of academic medical centers that have developed and validated diagnostic materials for the virus could begin testing patients immediately, even before the F.D.A. completes an emergency authorization review, which laboratories run by states and private companies have also applied for.
The C.D.C. has also announced that labs with two of three working components in its test kit could go ahead and use the tests, and it has broadened the criteria to include people who had traveled to places with coronavirus infections outside China.
Gathering evidence in scientific settings is crucial at this stage of the outbreak, as researchers examine genomes of current infections. Some in Washington State said that similarities between cases there suggest the virus may have been spreading in the state for weeks.
In one case, health officials scrambled to retrace every step of a man who had tested positive for the coronavirus, tracking down eight people he had been with at a lunch and 37 more who were in a clinic where he sought medical help. They also contacted people on a flight he was on to the United States.
The Coronavirus Outbreak

It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.

As politicians and parliaments struggle with the economic catastrophe brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, central banks have reached for the playbook of the 2008 global financial crisis. They are pumping liquidity into the banking system and trying to prop up key asset markets with large-scale purchases. This is helping to staunch the panic, but the shock is a global one — and it needs a global response.
For the second time this century, the world is facing an acute shortage of dollar funding. This is a big problem: An enormous amount of global financial activity depends on the use of the dollar. If we are to contain the fallout from the crisis, America’s central bank must act as a lender of last resort not just to America’s financial system but also to the entire world’s.
The question turns on what we mean by global finance. In 2008 the dollar shortage was confined largely to the banks of Europe and America. That is the Fed’s historic comfort zone, the cradle within which it was born a century ago. The coronavirus crisis explodes that 20th-century framework and poses the question: How does America’s central bank supply dollar liquidity to a polycentric world economy?
“Liquidity swap lines” are the main way to pipe dollars into the global financial system. These were first deployed in the 1960s, when they were used to circulate funds between central banks struggling to uphold the fixed exchange rates of the Bretton Woods system. Essentially, central banks credited each other with matching amounts of currency: A Deutschmark credit for the Fed at the German Bundesbank was offset by a dollar credit for the Germans in the United States.
The Fed responded first by lending money directly to the European banks in New York and then by using the swap lines to funnel dollars to them indirectly by way of their local central banks. For a brief moment in early December 2008, the swap lines to foreign central banks were the largest single item on the Fed’s balance sheet. Altogether 14 banks were attached to the Fed, including major emerging markets like South Korea, Brazil and Mexico, whose banks, like the Europeans’, had joined the dollar-based global financial system.
What does all this have to do with the coronavirus? As panic has swept through financial markets in the last two weeks, investors have begun seeking safety in cash — and above all in dollars. The American economy itself may look weak, but the dollar is still the most universally acceptable means of payment and store of value.
The pressure of the coronavirus crisis was such that on Thursday the Fed widened the swap network to include all 14 of the central banks it supported in 2008. The news had an immediate calming effect. Pressure on the exchange rates of Brazil and South Korea eased; the dollar has slipped back from the highs it touched earlier in the week. But as the pandemic’s impact on the world economy deepens, will the swap line system of 2008, with its echoes of the Cold War era, still do the job?
In 2008, European megabanks were the problem. Today the pressure is on Japanese and Taiwanese life insurers, pension funds and postal banks, which have made huge purchases of American corporate bonds that are now collapsing in value because of the shutdown of global economic activity. These financial institutions are not umbilically connected to the swap lines in the way that banks in London or Paris were. As the Fed struggles to calm the markets, the last thing it needs is for these institutions to unload their portfolios of American assets.
As for the growing power of emerging markets, China leads the way. But the growth of economies like Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Turkey has also been spectacular. Once a relatively marginal part of the world economy, the emerging economies are now key drivers of global growth. American investors, and indeed the world economy, have a deep interest in their prosperity.
Finally, there is the question of China. In 2008, China was already the main driver of global growth, so much so that some feared that it might cause a crippling global crisis by selling off its portfolio of U.S. Treasuries. That did not happen. Instead, China powered through the recession with a gigantic domestic stimulus package. Today, the country’s economy is larger than ever, as are its holdings of American assets. All told, the foreign debts of China’s businesses come to $1.3 trillion. As the global scramble for dollars begins and the American currency rises in value, those debts become less sustainable. That risks unleashing a chain reaction.
The crisis is still unfolding. The outflow from the emerging markets in recent weeks has been more rapid than ever before in history. To stop further losses, it may be necessary to adjust the swap line system. That will require imagination — and if not political cover from the White House and Congress, then at least forbearance. Doing so is crucial: The faltering effort to respond to the pandemic must not be hampered by a crisis of the dollar-based financial system.
What’s at stake is not just economic stability and the credibility of American financial leadership. It’s truly a matter of life and death.

Haiti announces a state of emergency after confirmed cases.
One by one, localities and now some of the nation’s biggest states are beginning to limit people’s movements as they struggle to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus before fast-growing caseloads overwhelm their hospitals.
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo moved Friday to sharply limit outdoor activity across the state, including by ordering nonessential businesses to keep all of their workers home. His wide-ranging executive order, which takes effect on Sunday at 8 p.m., was issued as the number of known cases in the state jumped to over 7,800.
Their moves were announced as California woke up Friday to new rules closing the state’s nonessential retail shops and sharply limiting outdoor movement, after Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered Californians — all 40 million of them — to stay in their houses as much as possible. There was initially confusion there over how the order would be enforced and interpreted, but Californians were told they could still take walks and leave their neighborhoods to hike or go to the beach, as long as they were able to practice social distancing.
States and localities announced the new rules as the death toll in the United States surpassed 200, and as Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., recorded their first deaths. There have now been deaths in more than half the states, with the most in Washington State, New York and California.
New York will allow healthy people under age 70 to go out for groceries and medicines, and to exercise and walk outside, as long as they stay six feet away from others. Mass transit will continue to run so that health care workers and other people with essential jobs can get to work, but people will be urged not to use it unless absolutely necessary. Nonessential gatherings of any size will be banned.
And certain essential businesses will be allowed to remain open, including: grocers, health care providers, pharmacies, gas stations, convenience stores, banks, hardware stores, laundromats, child-care providers, auto repair, utilities, warehouses and distributors, plumbers and other skilled contractors, animal-care providers, transportation providers, construction companies and many kinds of manufacturers.

Several Trump administration officials have self-quarantined over concerns of exposure to the virus. This week, Mick Mulvaney, the outgoing acting White House chief of staff, entered self-quarantine in his home state of South Carolina after his niece, with whom he shares an apartment in Washington, fell ill and was awaiting test results.
Last week, Ivanka Trump, the president’s eldest daughter and adviser, had stayed home “out of an abundance of caution” after an Australian official she recently met with tested positive for the coronavirus, a White House spokesman said. By Friday, Ms. Trump had returned to work, watching from the sideline as her father sparred with reporters in the briefing room.
A person familiar with the situation said she had tested negative for the virus.

The cashiers and stockroom employees at your local grocery are a source of calm, signifying that, even as demand has surged, supply chains remain intact and the essentials that people need remain available. But these same employees are growing tired and, because they constantly interact with customers, fearful of getting sick themselves.
President Trump suggested that immigration would strain health care systems.
“During a global pandemic they threaten to create a public storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants and the public at large,” Mr. Trump said, referring to people seeking to enter the country.
Speaking on a day when the worldwide death toll stood at more than 10,000, including more than 200 in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that there was a “fundamental public health reason” for closing the northern and southern borders. “Understand that: There’s a public health reason for doing that.”
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, corrected President Trump’s earlier suggestion that a malaria drug could cure coronavirus.

The term has angered Chinese officials and a wide range of critics, and China experts say labeling the virus that way will only ratchet up tensions between the two countries, while resulting in the kind of xenophobia that American leaders should discourage. Asian-Americans have reported incidents of racial slurs and physical abuse because of the erroneous perception that China is the cause of the virus.
On Thursday, a Washington Post photographer took an image of Mr. Trump’s speech materials on the White House podium that showed the word “coronavirus” crossed out and “Chinese” replaced in Sharpie.
A charter flight carrying more than 230 Americans and more than 75 Canadians who had been evacuated from the Costa Luminosa cruise ship in France idled on the tarmac in Atlanta for about five hours on Friday because health officials learned that three of the evacuees had tested positive for the coronavirus.
Jennifer Catron, an evacuee who described herself as a wedding photographer with some medical experience, described a chaotic, dramatic flight with perhaps two dozen medical issues, some emergencies, some relatively minor.
“This plane is a medical disaster,” Ms. Catron said in an email during the flight.
The French media reported that more than 600 passengers disembarked on Thursday, of whom 75 were tested and 36 found positive for the virus, none of them French. The French passengers were bused home, and the handful of  Spanish passengers were taken to a flight for Barcelona, the report said, while many American and Canadian passengers were taken to the Atlanta-bound flight. Italian passengers remained on the ship for a final leg of the voyage to their country.  
Haiti announces a state of emergency after confirmed cases.
Haiti announced a state of emergency on Thursday after two patients were confirmed to have the coronavirus.
Both patients were being treated in the University Hospital of Mirebalais, in the country’s central plateau. Both had been out of the country recently.
If extreme precautions are not taken, the virus could quickly overwhelm the country, warned Elizabeth Campa, senior health and policy adviser for Zanmi Lasante, the Haitian nonprofit organization that runs the Mirebalais hospital in partnership with the government.
The poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has only 124 intensive care unit beds for a population of about 11 million, and the capability to mechanically ventilate fewer than 70 patients, according to a recent survey of hospitals done by the Research and Education consortium for the Acute Care in Haiti study group.
But given that 75 percent of the population live in deep poverty, on less than $2.50 a day and without access to electricity or clean water, it is hard to imagine how many could survive the containment measures being carried out in places like France and Italy.
Mr. Trump signaled Friday that the federal government was mobilizing industry to provide urgently needed resources to help halt the spread of the virus, but he did not specify what steps he had taken after days of conflicting messages about his intentions.
At the same time, the president has faced increasing pressure from government officials and the health care industry to find a way to speed up new supplies.
Before Mr. Trump’s appearance on Friday, New York City’s mayor warned that the city was within weeks of running out of crucial supplies, with doctors and nurses confronting dwindling stocks of protective gear and hospitals facing shortages of lifesaving ventilators.
And medical leaders in Washington State, which has the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the country, have begun preparing a bleak triage strategy to determine which patients may have to be denied complete medical care in the event that the health system becomes overwhelmed in the coming weeks.
There have now been deaths in more than half the states, with the most in Washington State, New York and California.
“It’s an unprecedented situation,” said Dr. Pampee Young, chief medical officer of biomedical services at the Red Cross. “We are already actively triaging units, determining which hospitals can and can’t get blood.”
While donor blood is not being used to treat coronavirus patients, transfusions are still needed for cases such as trauma, organ transplants or complications of childbirth.
The death toll mounts in Italy, and Britain closes its pubs.
Italy reported 627 new coronavirus deaths  on Friday, its highest number in a single day, bringing its death toll above 4,000. Spain became the second European nation to register more than 1,000 deaths, and officials there warned that the country’s health care system could soon be overwhelmed.

French officials continued to tighten restrictions on movements ahead of the expected peak of the epidemic there. In Germany, authorities in the southern state of Bavaria issued an order asking people to stay indoors in most cases — the most far-reaching measure in the country, which had been appealing to people’s sense of public duty and reason to keep them at home.
“We have a real threat to our country and to the ability of our National Health Service to manage it,” said Mr. Johnson, who added that he would keep the transportation network open.
The fast spread of the virus means that many nations are facing simultaneous shortages of desperately needed medical equipment — from protective garb to beds to ambulances —  as their health care systems buckle under ever higher caseloads.
“The health situation in Madrid is critical,” said Ángela Hernández, the deputy secretary general of Amyts, an association of doctors in Madrid. “We’re no longer in a phase of health alert, but instead of alarm.”
In the Catalonia region, hospital patients are being housed in hotels. Some hospitals in the Basque region have now dedicated most floors to coronavirus cases.
And in France, there is a growing outcry over the scarcity of face masks. Jérôme Salomon, a top official at France’s health ministry, said that 35 million had already been distributed and promised that authorities were ramping up production and distribution.
Health officials in Germany, which has 28,000 intensive care beds, are attempting to increase capacity by setting up temporary hospitals in empty rehabilitation clinics, hotels and trade fair halls.
“Everyone can and everyone must do their part in this crisis,” the Bavarian governor, Markus Söder, in Munich on Friday. “People are going to die. Corona is not just a flu, it is a new virus.”

Need a Coronavirus Test? Being Rich and Famous May Help
A shortage in testing has left sick people and health care workers around the U.S. without answers. Yet the list of celebrity patients grows every day, raising questions about privileged access.
The Brooklyn Nets managed to arrange tests for its entire roster. Four were positive, and one exhibited symptoms.
Politicians, celebrities, social media influencers and even N.B.A. teams have been tested for the new coronavirus. But as that list of rich, famous and powerful people grows by the day, so do questions about whether they are getting access to testing that is denied to other Americans.
Some of these high-profile people say they are feeling ill and had good reason to be tested. Others argue that those who were found to be infected and then isolated themselves provided a good example to the public.
But with testing still in short supply in areas of the country, leaving health care workers and many sick people unable to get diagnoses, some prominent personalities have obtained tests without exhibiting symptoms or having known contact with someone who has the virus, as required by some testing guidelines. Others have refused to specify how they were tested.
The same day, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, in a post on Twitter, chided the Brooklyn Nets, which managed to arrange tests for its entire roster. Four were positive, with one exhibiting symptoms.
“We wish them a speedy recovery,” Mr. de Blasio wrote. “But, with all due respect, an entire NBA team should NOT get tested for COVID-19 while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealthy, but for the sick.”
Access has proved uneven across the country, even as guidelines for who qualifies have broadened and the laboratories conducting tests have expanded, from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to state health departments and then to hospitals and private labs.

C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
In areas of the country where the virus has been slow to appear, people have been able to obtain tests easily. But in New York, California, Washington State and Massachusetts, where the virus has spread rapidly and demand for tests is most high, it is very difficult.
The New York City Health Department has directed doctors only to order tests for patients in need of hospitalization. People with mild symptoms are being told to quarantine themselves at home. Even health care workers, at high risk of contracting the virus and transmitting it, have struggled to get tested.
In New Rochelle, a community north of Manhattan where the virus has spread, a sick mother was told she could not get tested because she hadn’t been to a global “hot spot.” In Boston, an employee at Biogen, a tech company where many dozens tested positive after a conference, was turned away because he didn’t have symptoms. On Twitter, the hashtag #CDCWontTestMe has been circulating for weeks.
Police chiefs across the country are growing concerned that they cannot get their hands on tests.
“What’s frustrating is to continue to hear that there aren’t testing kits available, and my rank and file have to continue to answer calls for service while professional athletes and movie stars are getting tested without even showing any symptoms,” said Eddie Garcia, the police chief of San Jose, Calif., on a conference call with law enforcement officials across the country.
The Hollywood elite — stars, agents, studio and network executives — have concierge doctors on speed dial during the best of times and are used to receiving preferential treatment at Los Angeles medical centers like Cedars-Sinai and Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Many A-listers use LifeSpan, a private practice.
Over the past few days, however, some celebrities — even ones with symptoms — have expressed frustration about an inability to get tested because of a shortage of kits. Heidi Klum, the TV personality and model, posted a video on Instagram on Friday from Los Angeles in which she claimed to have tried two doctors without luck. “I just can’t get one,” she said.

But generally, celebrities of all kinds appear to have had a far easier time getting diagnoses. On Monday, Arielle Charnas, a social media influencer in Manhattan with more than 1.3 million Instagram followers, posted that she’d had a sore throat and a fever for the “past two days.” She was told that she did not meet the criteria for testing and that she should treat her symptoms at home.
But after posting to Instagram, she said she was flooded with fan messages asking her to get screened for Covid-19. She tagged a friend, Dr. Jake Deutsch, founder of Cure Urgent Care, who agreed to test her.
She was swabbed from her car, documenting the procedure online. She tagged both Dr. Deutsch’s Instagram account and that of his practice, thanking them. On Wednesday morning, she posted a statement letting her followers know the results were positive. “I realize that there are many individuals, both in New York City, and nationwide, who do not have the ability to receive immediate medical care at the first sign of sickness, and access to care is #1 priority in a time like this,” she wrote.
On Capitol Hill, where four senators and nearly a dozen House members have chosen to self-quarantine after possible exposure to the virus, patterns seemed to emerge.
Those who consulted their own doctors or the attending physician of Congress were by and large advised against testing if they were asymptomatic.
“Each of the physicians that I consulted with advised me that since I have no symptoms, since I’m not sick, they said testing was medically ineffective,” Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said on Saturday in an interview with ABC News.
Some who obtained tests were close allies of the president — Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a frequent golfing partner of Mr. Trump; Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the incoming White House chief of staff; and Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, who learned he had been exposed to the virus as he boarded Air Force One last week to fly back to Washington with Mr. Trump. Their tests came back negative.
Mr. Gaetz said on Twitter that White House medical officials had told him he was being tested not “because I am in Congress — but because I had been in close contact with President Trump over several days.”
Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, acknowledged the criticism in an interview on Wednesday with ESPN. But he insisted the league sought tests at the direction of public health officials.
“Let me begin with the situation in Oklahoma City last Wednesday night,” Mr. Silver said. “The Utah Jazz did not ask to be tested. The Oklahoma public health official there on the spot not only required that they be tested, but they weren’t allowed to leave their locker room, which was for at least four hours after the game, where they had to stay, masks on.”
The league has disclosed few details on how it gained access to the tests.
Quest, as well as LabCorp, another major diagnostic company, said tests were processed in the order they were received.
A spokeswoman for the Nets said the tests were obtained through a private company, to avoid using public resources. The testing took place after the team “noticed that several of our players and staff had symptoms,” she said.
The team pushed back on criticism that it had received unfair access, saying, “If we had waited for players to exhibit symptoms, they might have continued to pose a risk to their family, friends and the public.”
According to a statement from Major League Baseball, “players are only being tested under certain circumstances if they exhibit symptoms, and the tests are being administered by the same doctors treating the general public.”
The Yankees were the first baseball team with a known positive test: a minor league pitcher. An estimated 150 to 200 Yankees minor leaguers and staff members have been in self-quarantine, and the minor league complex, which underwent a deep cleaning, is closed until March 25.
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.

The Coronavirus Outbreak
A Promising Treatment for Coronavirus Fails
A study of 199 adults in China using the drug H.I.V. Kaletra showed no benefit in treating coronavirus.
Antiviral drugs that had held promise as a potential treatment for the coronavirus did not work in one of the first major studies in seriously ill patients, researchers from China reported on Wednesday.
There is no proven drug treatment for the new coronavirus, and doctors around the world have been desperately testing an array of medicines in hopes of finding something that will help patients, especially those who are severely ill. Several antiviral drugs have been considered possible treatments, though so far none has proved effective.
The new findings involve a study of 199 adults, ages 48 to 68, who were hospitalized and severely ill with the virus at Jin Yin-Tan Hospital in Wuhan, China.

For 14 days, half of the patients received standard care alone, and half were given the antiviral drugs plus standard care. Standard care includes the usual treatments for pneumonia, including oxygen if needed, and other medicines needed to keep patients stable and comfortable. The drugs did not shorten the illness or prevent deaths.
An editorial published along with the article called the research “a heroic effort,” saying it was proof that useful studies could be done, even in the midst of an overwhelming pandemic.
Earlier reports from China showed that doctors were pulling out all of the stops to try to help their patients, dosing them with antibiotics and antiviral drugs to try to fight off the virus and bacterial infections that they feared might complicate the illness. Some patients were also given steroids or other drugs in an effort to tamp down severe inflammation, an overreaction by the immune system that could be fatal.
There is no solid evidence yet that anything works, but the epidemic is moving so fast that doctors are trying approaches where even preliminary data suggests there may be a benefit. Many feel they are on their own to develop treatment protocols. Federal health authorities like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend supportive care, but have said there is no evidence yet to support antiviral drugs or treatments for inflammation.
“If I’m out in the community and I’ve got somebody who’s dying of course I would do whatever I could to try and help them,” said Dr. Tim Schacker, the vice dean for research and an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota medical school.

A number of hospitals were giving coronavirus patients hydroxychloroquine, an old, inexpensive and relatively safe malaria drug that lab studies indicated might keep the coronavirus from invading human cells. Reports of its use in patients in China and in France have suggested that it may help, but there is not enough data to be sure.
In Seattle, many hospitals have signed up to enroll patients in a clinical trial of Gilead’s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir. The trial is a controlled study, meaning that some patients will be picked at random to receive placebos rather than the drug — the gold-standard type of study to determine whether a drug really works.
Dr. James Town, director of the medical intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, said that the first choice for most patients would be the remdesivir study. Those not eligible for the study could apply to the Food and Drug Administration for “compassionate use,” special permission sometimes given to receive an experimental drug outside of a study.
The University of Minnesota is conducting three studies, including one on remdesivir for seriously ill patients. A second study will give hydroxychloroquine to people who have been exposed to the coronavirus, because they live in the same household as patients, to see if the drug can prevent them from becoming infected.
The third study will use an old, safe drug called losartan, normally given to treat high blood pressure, to find out whether it can prevent mild coronavirus infections from turning more serious. The drug blocks the receptor that the virus uses to get into cells, so researchers think it might stop or slow the illness.

Coronavirus Disrupts Troop Withdrawal in Afghanistan
Thousands of American and NATO troops are scheduled to leave in the next few months, but quarantine procedures are complicating those efforts.
Travelers arriving in Kabul had their temperatures taken before entering the airport on Monday. There are at least 21 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Afghanistan.
WASHINGTON — The U.S. commander in Afghanistan is halting American and allied troops from entering Afghanistan and, in turn, preventing some troops from leaving, for the next month, American and European officials said. The planning reflects mounting concerns as the coronavirus has spread in the country in recent days.
Gen. Austin S. Miller’s decision aims to protect his forces from the virus. But, in turn, it may complicate the drawdown of troops ordered by President Trump after the United States recently signed a peace agreement with the Taliban.
Between the ongoing Taliban-fueled violence, political uncertainty at the top of the Afghan government and the possibility of a larger outbreak of the virus, NATO has put aside for now discussions of the troop drawdown. European diplomats said the uncertainty in Afghanistan will make it difficult for the Americans to stick to their drawdown plan and for NATO to follow with its own reductions.
Several European countries had tentative plans to deploy additional logistics troops to Afghanistan to help close bases as part of the peace plan. But with the uncertainty over carrying out the peace agreement and a demand for logistical expertise in Europe to fight the virus, those deployments are on hold for now, a European official said.
The European official said that troops for several countries were on a two-week quarantine before entering Afghanistan. On Tuesday, the German military said its troops going into Afghanistan would be quarantined for two weeks and any troop swaps would be postponed for at least two weeks.
But the new orders from Resolute Support could stretch that quarantine period for far longer, as the United States-led NATO command puts measures in place to try to slow the spread of the virus into Afghanistan.
One allied official said that even in a worst-case scenario, the readiness of their forces should be only marginally affected. The pause in rotations will make sure personnel coming into Afghanistan are virus-free and minimize any risk that troops leaving would infect others in their home countries.
Allied countries also plan to develop new protective measures, like isolating troops ahead of deployments. In addition, the official said, NATO nations are looking to send more medical staff to Afghanistan to help protect and treat troops deployed there.
One Defense Department official said that the new measures were also intended to stop the spread of the virus via troops coming into Afghanistan from Europe. The fear, another official said, is having virus cases overwhelm a military medical system that is meant to support the war effort. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that have not yet been made public.
American officials are particularly worried about the potential impact of the coronavirus on Afghanistan, and deeply concerned that the Afghan security forces, the troops they have trained to protect the country, will end up spreading it there.
“To preserve our currently-healthy force, Resolute Support is making the necessary adjustments to temporarily pause personnel movement into theater,” General Miller said. “In some cases, these measures will necessitate some servicemembers remaining beyond their scheduled departure dates to continue the mission.”
Currently, 21 American and coalition service members are exhibiting flulike symptoms and in isolation, according to the statement, but tests for the virus have to be sent to labs in Germany.
There are at least 22 confirmed coronavirus cases in Afghanistan, but testing is extremely limited and thousands of people from Iran, where the virus has spread and infected thousands, enter Afghanistan’s porous western reaches daily.
With squalid living conditions and poor health from years of fighting, Afghan troops are ill-equipped to stop the spread of the virus. And outside of the biggest cities in Afghanistan, the supplies of clean water are limited. Social distancing is also difficult, either in military barracks or rural Afghan villages.
At earlier phases of the war, the American government has tracked the spread of various diseases to the tight quarters of Afghan military barracks. Several Afghan military bases, for example, had to fight infestations of bed bugs in past years after Afghan troops brought them into a barracks where they quickly spread.
If an Afghan soldier caught the coronavirus from a NATO service member, the consequences would be far more devastating.
But American troops returning from Afghanistan are also running into their own complications.
The Pentagon’s directive to quarantine returning forces from overseas has created a short-term housing crisis as military commands have wrestled with putting large numbers of troops in areas with limited spaces and amenities for up to two weeks, a Defense Department official said.
In past weeks, at least 300 troops from the 82nd Airborne division returning from Afghanistan have had to self-quarantine at Fort Bragg, N.C., and dozens more from the 1st Armored Division are doing the same at Fort Bliss, Tex.

For the first time since the coronavirus crisis began, China on Thursday reported no new local infections for the previous day, a milestone in its costly battle with the outbreak that has since become a pandemic, upending daily life and economic activity around the world.
Officials said 34 new coronavirus cases had been confirmed, all involving people who had come to China from elsewhere.
In signaling that an end to China’s epidemic might be in sight, the announcement could pave the way for officials to focus more on reviving the country’s economy, which nearly ground to a halt after the government imposed travel restrictions and quarantine measures. In recent days, economic life has been resuming in fits and starts.
Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak
The virus has infected more than 672,500 people in at least 171 countries.
But China is not out of danger yet. Experts have said that it will need to see at least 14 consecutive days without new infections for the outbreak to be considered truly over. It remains to be seen whether the virus will re-emerge once daily life restarts and travel restrictions are lifted around the country.
“It’s very clear that the actions taken in China have almost brought to an end their first wave of infections,” said Ben Cowling, a professor and head of the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hong Kong University’s School of Public Health. “The question is what will happen if there’s a second wave, because the kind of measures that China has implemented are not necessarily sustainable in the long term.”
To contain the outbreak, the authorities shut schools and workplaces and imposed travel and quarantine restrictions on broad swaths of the population and many visitors from abroad. Since January, more than 50 million people in the central province of Hubei, including its capital, Wuhan, where the outbreak began, have been subjected to a strict lockdown.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced on Wednesday that it would stop making arrests, except for those that are considered “mission critical,” until after the coronavirus crisis had passed.
Fear of an outbreak inside the agency’s detention centers is growing. At some facilities, detainees are being held in their cells for up to 21 hours a day, including during mealtimes — measures, according to officials, that are necessary to prevent the spread the coronavirus. But in other centers, requests for hot water or cleaning supplies are being denied because the items can be considered dangerous contraband.
No cases of the coronavirus have been reported in the detention centers and jails that house detained immigrants across the country. But 10 immigrant detainees at a contract detention center in Aurora, Colo., have been “cohorted” in an isolated dorm since Tuesday and were being closely monitored, the agency said.
The more than 37,000 people detained by the agency could be especially vulnerable if cases appear because of the tight living quarters, communal bathrooms and large, open cafeterias. And yet the measures intended to contain the virus have not only created greater discomfort in places where inmates say conditions are harsh in the best of times, but are also producing anxiety and fear.
Many ICE detainees say they feel like sitting ducks who will inevitably be infected. “The officials here have not said anything to us about what is happening outside, or any extra precautions that we should take,” said a 40-year-old man from the Congo who is detained in a Karnes City, Texas, facility.
A relief package to provide sick leave, unemployment benefits, free coronavirus testing, and food and medical aid to people affected by the pandemic was signed into law by President Trump on Wednesday evening after the Senate passed it by a wide margin. It was approved by the House last week.

The Senate raced to respond to the coronavirus pandemic with an economic stabilization package, and lawmakers braced for potential travel restrictions.
It would allow the Exchange Stabilization Fund, an emergency reserve account that is usually used for currency market interventions, to be tapped to cover those costs, and also temporarily guarantee money-market mutual funds. Lawmakers were moving swiftly to assemble those and other proposals into legislation, but the details remained far from complete.
Two members of Congress test positive for the coronavirus.
For the first time, the legions of infected Americans include sitting members of Congress: Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, who was on the House floor as recently as early Saturday morning, and Representative Ben McAdams, Democrat of Utah.
In a statement, Mr. Diaz-Balart said he had developed symptoms later Saturday and received a positive test result on Wednesday.
He has been working from his apartment in Washington in self-quarantine, he said, and did not plan to return home to avoid exposing his family. He said his wife, Tia, had underlying conditions “that put her at exceptionally high risk.”
“I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,” Mr. Diaz-Balart said. “However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow C.D.C. guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus.
Mr. McAdams said in a statement that he developed cold-like symptons at home on Saturday night after returning from Washington, and isolated himself. He later developed a fever, dry cough and labored breathing, and learned Wednesday that his test results were positive. He said he would continue working from home until it was safe to end his self-quarantine.
Several other members of Congress have said they were in self-quarantine after interacting with people who tested positive for the coronavirus. They include Senator Ted Cruz of Texas; Senator Rick Scott of Florida; Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona; Representative Doug Collins of Georgia; Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina; and Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, all Republicans.
Coronavirus ravages seven members of a New Jersey family, killing three.
Now, her close-knit clan is united anew by unspeakable grief: Mrs. Fusco, 73, died on Wednesday night after contracting the coronavirus — hours after her son died from the virus and five days after her daughter’s death, a relative said.
Four other children who contracted the coronavirus remain hospitalized, three of them in critical condition, the relative, Roseann Paradiso Fodera, said.
Mrs. Fusco’s eldest child, Rita Fusco-Jackson, 55, of Freehold, N.J., died on Friday with the virus. Her eldest son, Carmine Fusco, of Bath, Pa., died on Wednesday.
Many hospitalized in the U.S. are younger adults.
American adults of all ages — not just those in their 70s, 80s and 90s — are being seriously sickened by the coronavirus, according to a report on nearly 2,500 cases in the United States.

The report, issued Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that — as in other countries — the oldest patients were at greatest risk of becoming seriously ill or dying. But of the 508 coronavirus patients known to have been hospitalized in the U.S., 38 percent were notably younger — between 20 and 54. And nearly half of the 121 sickest patients studied — those who were admitted to intensive care units — were adults under 65.
Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, appealed on Wednesday for people of the millennial generation to stop socializing in groups and to take care to protect themselves and others.
In the C.D.C. report, 20 percent of the hospitalized patients and 12 percent of the intensive care patients were between the ages of 20 and 44, basically spanning the millennial generation.
Antiviral drugs that held promise as a potential treatment for the coronavirus did not work in one of the first major studies in seriously ill patients, researchers from China reported on Wednesday. “No benefit was observed,” the researchers wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine.
There is no proven drug treatment for the new coronavirus, and doctors around the world have been desperately testing an array of medicines in hopes of finding something that will help patients, especially those who are severely ill.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced an international trial to figure out which antiviral drugs may be most effective.
The research, called the Solidarity Trial, will take place in hospitals in several countries, including Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand. Other countries are expected to join; the United States is not yet among them.
President Trump moved Wednesday to send military hospital ships to areas hard-hit by the coronavirus, and invoked a law allowing the federal government to order American manufacturers to make critically needed medical equipment, like ventilators, respirators and protective gear for health care workers.
The Trump administration’s slow initial response to the global crisis left the United States facing shortages of test kits, equipment and available hospital beds. At a White House briefing, Mr. Trump said that he would invoke the law, the Defense Production Act, “just in case we need it.”
The president said he had dispatched two military hospitals ships to help with the crisis — one to New York, the other to the West Coast — but officials later said it would be weeks before the New York-bound one would arrive.
A federal plan to combat the coronavirus, which was shared with The New York Times, warned that shortages of medical supplies like protective gear and pharmaceuticals could occur, “impacting health care, emergency services, and other elements of critical infrastructure.” Hospitals around the country are warning of critical shortages of supplies.
Several states are building makeshift hospitals to meet the growing need for beds for coronavirus patients.
In Washington State, King County is turning a soccer field into a tented hospital with 200 beds. The actions are meant to preserve local hospital beds for the most severe cases, the county, which includes Seattle, said in a statement. “This is a rapidly evolving situation that requires quick and decisive action,” it said.
Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said a 250-bed hospital would be set up on the state fairgrounds in Salem by Friday. State officials are also looking to identify 1,000 temporary hospital beds for recovering patients without the coronavirus, which would free up space for coronavirus patients.
Social distancing doesn’t have to mean isolation. Let us help.
The regulations around social distancing have forced many friends and family to change the way they communicate and spend time together. It is important to stay connected during these stressful times. Here are some ideas that may help:
Politicians, celebrities, social media influencers and even N.B.A. teams have been tested for the new coronavirus. But as that list of rich, famous and powerful people grows by the day, so do questions about whether they are getting access to testing that is denied to other Americans.
Some of these high-profile people say they are feeling ill and had good reason to be tested. Others argue that those who were found to be infected and then isolated themselves provided a good example to the public.
But with testing still in short supply in areas of the country, leaving health care workers and many sick people unable to get diagnoses, some prominent personalities have obtained tests without exhibiting symptoms or having known contact with someone who has the virus, as required by some testing guidelines. Others have refused to specify how they were tested.
The question burst into public view this week after the Brooklyn Nets announced Tuesday that four of their players — including Kevin Durant, one of the biggest stars in the N.B.A. — had tested positive. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York crictized the dynamic, writing on Twitter that while he wished the athletes “a speedy recovery,” he did not think the N.B.A. should be getting tests for its athletes while critically ill patients were kept waiting.
“Tests should not be for the wealthy, but for the sick,” he wrote.
Financial markets reeled again on Wednesday, as governments ramped up efforts to contain the virus and investors waited for lawmakers in Washington to take action on proposals to bolster the American economy.
News that the Senate approved a bill to provide sick leave, jobless benefits, free coronavirus testing and other aid stemmed some of Wednesday’s losses late in the day. But when all was said and done, the S&P 500 had fallen about 5 percent, stocks in Europe were sharply lower and oil prices cratered.
The American oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, dropped 24 percent to just over $21 a barrel, the lowest price since 2003. The global Brent benchmark fell to just above $25 a barrel, a level just below January 2016. Oil prices are more than 60 percent below where they were at the beginning of the year.
Adding to the outbreak’s growing economic toll, G.M., Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler said they were closing plants, idling tens of thousands of workers. The United Auto Workers pressed the automakers to take the step after reports on Wednesday that a worker at a Ford truck plant in Dearborn, Mich., had tested positive for the virus.
Russian coronavirus disinformation campaign is hitting Europe, E.U. says.
Russia and media outlets affiliated with the Kremlin have begun a “significant disinformation campaign against the West,” spreading misinformation about the coronavirus outbreak that has already had real-life consequences in Europe, according to an internal European Union document examined by The New York Times.
The report, dated March 18, said that Russia-backed misinformation has sparked rioting in Ukraine and has driven people to buy potentially dangerous bogus remedies. It said Russia was pushing a false narrative that the virus was being brought to Europe by migrants.
“The overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national health care systems — thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak,” the document said.
As the virus spreads through the Middle East, concern rises about its potential toll.
As governments in the Middle East enact emergency measures to slow the spread of the virus, closing borders and grounding flights, many are bracing for what they fear could become a crisis in places wracked by war and instability.
Oil-wealthy Gulf countries with Western-style health care systems are best positioned to combat the virus. But the response will be curtailed by crumbling health services and weak economies in some countries; war and densely packed refugee camps in others.
Outside of Iran, which has one of the world’s worst outbreaks with more than 17,000 cases, a swath of countries stretching from Morocco to Oman have so far declared only a small percentage of the world’s cases.
The greatest concentration thus far is in wealthy Qatar, where the virus has swept through camps of migrant laborers, mostly from the Indian subcontinent, and the tally reached 442 cases on Wednesday.
[Update: India, day 1: World’s largest lockdown begins.]
In the most vulnerable parts of the Middle East, there are worries the virus has spread undetected. Iraq had confirmed 164 cases. War-torn Libya, Yemen and Syria have yet to declare a single case. But at least eight cases in Pakistan were linked to travel to Syria, according to Pakistani officials.
Elsewhere in the region, Israel, which has more than 430 cases, closed its borders to all foreign nationals on Wednesday, with some exceptions. The authorities stepped up efforts to enforce compliance with quarantine orders as lawmakers debated a mandatory lockdown.
In Afghanistan, the American commander is stopping most U.S. and allied troops from entering and leaving the country for the next month, American and European officials said. The planning reflects growing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus there in recent days. The Taliban, which control large parts of the country, have started requiring Afghans traveling from Iran to prove that they have been screened before being allowed to return to their homes.
The Afghan Health Ministry has reported 22 cases of coronavirus, but officials worry there may be many more infections because so few people have been tested.

The legislation provides $50 billion in grants and loans to airlines, money that is meant to cover employee paychecks and forestall job cuts until October. But even as they welcomed the help, airline executives told their employees to prepare for difficult times, saying they would still have to make tough decisions to get through the coronavirus outbreak and its aftermath.
The pandemic could permanently alter the industry, United’s chief executive, Oscar Munoz, and president, Scott Kirby, warned employees in a memo on Friday. Also on Friday, Delta Air Line’s chief executive, Ed Bastian, asked his employees to consider taking unpaid leaves from the company.

The plan is the largest emergency spending program in the nation’s history, but some economists have said it might not be enough to counter the potentially enormous economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. And investors also faced fresh evidence of the economic impact of the pandemic in the form of a consumer sentiment reading that showed a sharp drop in confidence.
The selling reflected caution ahead of the weekend, when bad news about the virus’s spread or further efforts to contain it could overtake the positive sentiment stirred up by the passage of the stimulus bill, Steven Ricchiuto, the chief economist at Mizuho, said in a note to clients.
Still, he thinks that the underlying cause of the recent market turmoil, the spread of the virus, will continue to gnaw at investors in the near future. “We need to see the cases stabilize and come down and that could take some time,” said Mr. James, who invests in small and medium-size companies.
Consumer sentiment tumbled in March as the coronavirus pandemic wiped out millions of jobs and erased trillions of dollars in market value.
Richard Curtin, chief economist for the survey, noted that two of the larger monthly drops — in October 2008 and December 1980 — presaged long and deep recessions. The other came after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005. The coronavirus is in some ways the equivalent of a hurricane hitting the entire country at once.

The sharp drop in confidence is hardly a surprise. But it is another troubling sign of how the pandemic is rippling through the economy. If the economic collapse leads to a pullback in spending even among consumers who have not lost jobs and income, that could set off a downward spiral that could be hard to pull out of even when the immediate threat of the virus has passed.
A kind of caste system is developing around the coronavirus outbreak: the rich holed up in vacation properties; the middle class at home with restless children; the working class on the front lines of the economy, stretched by the demands of work and parenting, if there is even work to be had.
As schools and day care centers close, many parents who cannot work from home are in a bind. Darlyne Dagrin, the mother of a 22-month-old in New Jersey, missed work twice this week when she could not find a friend or a relative to care for her son. She was told that “if you call out again, you’re out of a job.”
Google said it had removed the Infowars app from its Google Play store. The app is part of the media company owned by Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist and conservative radio show host. Google removed the app on Friday after Mr. Jones posted a video disputing the need for social distancing and some of the isolation policies aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
Earlier this month, The New York State attorney general issued a cease-and-desist order to Mr. Jones because of false claims on his website that his diet supplements and toothpaste could be used to fight the coronavirus.
Google also said it was donating about $800 million in financial assistance to help small businesses secure capital and continue to advertise through the company. In a blog post on Friday, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said it was providing $250 million in ad grants to more than 100 government agencies including the World Health Organization to disseminate information on how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Philanthropists offer a guide on how to help during the pandemic.
The coronavirus pandemic has created an immediate need for wealthy benefactors to fund nonprofit organizations that support people in health or economic distress.
Double down on regular charities. Money is rushing into coronavirus-related charities, but most other nonprofit groups are lacking in funds, too. Most have canceled their spring fund-raising galas, which can account for a significant part of their annual budgets.
Everlane, the apparel start-up, said on Friday that it was eliminating a large portion of its staff as it navigates the effects of the pandemic. The company said it cut 222 part-time retail and customer experience employees and furloughed 68 full-time retail employees. Affected staff received two weeks of severance pay. Everlane said it hoped to “build our team back as the economy improves.”
The food distribution company Sysco said on Friday that some of its employees who have been furloughed because of the coronavirus will have the option to work at Kroger locations for the next 30 days. Like many grocery stores, Kroger has seen a surge in demand over the last few week as panic-shopping customers have filled their shopping carts with shelf-stable supplies.
L Brands, the owner of Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret, said on Friday that it would furlough most store associates “plus those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home” starting April 5. Associates will receive pay and benefits through April 4. Senior executives will also take a pay cut.
The coronavirus could cause job cuts of more than one million workers in the global oil field services industry, according to a forecast from Rystad Energy. The Norway-based consulting firm estimated that the industry employs more than five million people, including drillers, engineers and technicians, and that firms will cut people because of plummeting demand, low prices for oil and safety reasons.
The average national price for gasoline fell on Friday to a penny under $2 a gallon for the first time since March 2016, according to GasBuddy, the travel and navigation app. Gasoline prices have been falling steadily since late February as the coronavirus outbreak has curtailed business and leisure driving.
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.

Trump Signs $2 Trillion Bill as U.S. Virus Cases Pass 100,000
Read about the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic here.
There are now 100,000 known coronavirus cases in the United States.
Coronavirus cases now threaten America’s middle.
U.S. cities face shortages of masks, ventilators and emergency gear.
Health care workers outside Elmhurst Hospital Center in New York City on Friday. The hospital, in the borough of Queens, has seen a surge of coronavirus cases.
There are now 100,000 known coronavirus cases in the United States.
More than 100,000 people in the United States have now been infected with the coronavirus, according to a New York Times database, a grim milestone that comes on the same day the national death toll surpassed 1,500.
Earlier this week the country surpassed the case totals in China and Italy. The number of known cases has risen rapidly in recent days as testing ramped up after weeks of widespread shortages and delays.
And the outbreak has already transformed life in the United States, where millions of Americans have been asked to do what might have been unthinkable only a week or two ago: Don’t go to work, don’t go to school, don’t leave the house,  except in limited circumstances.
The directives to keep people at home to stunt the spread of the coronavirus began in California, and have quickly been adopted across the country. By Friday, two dozen states and the Navajo Nation had told their residents to stay at home as much as possible, orders that affect at least 223 million Americans.
The pandemic is also having an effect on the primary calendar, as states across the country scramble to protect voters and poll workers. Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin on Friday requested that absentee ballots be sent to all of the state’s 3.3 million registered voters ahead of its April 7 presidential primary. And on the same day, Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania signed a measure postponing the contest from April 28 to June 2.
President Trump on Friday evening lamented the loss of economic gains that he had often used to measure his success in office and that served as the heart of his re-election message until the coronavirus hit the United States.
He then said he told Vice President Mike Pence, his coronavirus coordinator, to stop calling Mr. Inslee and Ms. Whitmer: “Don’t call the woman in Michigan, doesn’t make any difference,” he said of Ms. Whitmer.
President Trump on Friday signed into law the largest economic stimulus package in modern American history, backing a $2 trillion measure designed to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Under the law, the government will deliver direct payments and jobless benefits for individuals, money for states and a huge bailout fund for businesses battered by the crisis.

The measure will also offer $377 billion in federally guaranteed loans to small businesses and establish a $500 billion government lending program for distressed companies reeling from the crisis, including allowing the administration the ability to take equity stakes in airlines that received aid to help compensate taxpayers. It will also send $100 billion to hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic.
The law was the product of days of talks between members of Mr. Trump’s administration and Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress. And even before Mr. Trump held a bill signing on Friday afternoon, congressional leaders said they expected to negotiate more legislative responses to the pandemic in the coming months.
Coronavirus cases now threaten America’s middle.
A second wave of coronavirus cases is charting a path far from coastal Washington State, California, New York and New Jersey, and threatening population centers in America’s middle that had no known cases of coronavirus not long ago.
As the toll of the virus grows, mayors, county executives and governors are sounding the alarm over a dearth of equipment and struggling to deal with the deadly onslaught.
U.S. cities face shortages of masks, ventilators and emergency gear.
Officials in nearly 200 U.S. cities, large and small, report a dire need for face masks, ventilators and other emergency equipment to respond to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a survey released on Friday.
More than 90 percent — or 192 cities — said they did not have an adequate supply of face masks for police officers, firefighters and emergency workers. In addition, 92 percent of cities reported a shortage of test kits and 85 percent did not have a sufficient supply of ventilators available to local health facilities.
Roughly two-thirds of the cities said they had not received any emergency equipment or supplies from their state, the report said. And of those that did receive state aid, nearly 85 percent said it was not enough to meet their needs.
In total, the conference tabulated that cities need 28.5 million face masks, 24.4 million other items of personal protection equipment, 7.9 million test kits and 139,000 ventilators.
A series of missteps and lost opportunities dogged the coronavirus response of the United States, which now leads the globe with known cases.
Among them: a failure to take the pandemic seriously even as it engulfed China, a deeply flawed effort to provide broad testing for the virus that left the country blind to the extent of the crisis, and a dire shortage of masks and protective gear to protect doctors and nurses on the front lines, as well as ventilators to keep the critically ill alive.

“I’m feeling scared,” said Mr. Palma, who is 41 and nervous about the $15,000 in medical debt he has from two recent hospital stays. “I don’t know what’s the ending. But I know I’m not in good shape.”
“Our negotiations with G.M. regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive, but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,” the president said in a statement. “G.M. was wasting time. Today’s action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives.”
Earlier on Friday, Mr. Trump lashed out at General Motors on Friday, blaming it for overpromising on its ability to make new ventilators for critically ill coronavirus patients.
No country has been hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic than Italy, where officials announced Friday that more than 950 people had died in the past 24 hours. It was the highest daily tally yet, lifting the national death toll to 9,134 — by far the highest in the world.
Italy’s staggering toll suggested that its early attempts to stem the outbreak — first isolating towns, then regions, then shutting down the country in a porous lockdown — always lagged behind the virus’s trajectory. And the country’s outbreak has yet to reach its peak, scientists warn.
No country has been hit harder by the coronavirus than Italy, and no province has suffered as many losses as Bergamo. Photos and voices from there evoke a portrait of despair.
The virus has also penetrated the high walls of the Vatican.
The Vatican on Tuesday said an official who lives in the pope’s residence has tested positive and required hospitalization. Now the Vatican is testing scores of people and considering isolating measures for Francis, 83, who has tested negative in two separate tests, according to top Vatican officials.
Doctors find the coronavirus affects some patients in subtle and unexpected ways.
The coronavirus mostly infects the lungs, causing pneumonia in severe cases; the typical symptoms are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. But some infected patients, including one recently in Brooklyn, have arrived at the hospital with symptoms not of respiratory disease, but of heart attack.
On close examination, the Brooklyn patient and some others were suffering from acute myocarditis, a severe inflammation of the heart. The condition also has been seen in patients with other viral infections, such as MERS and the H1N1 swine flu. Patients with coronavirus infections and heart complications have a risk of death nearly four times higher than patients without heart complications.
Other doctors have been keeping a close watch on the virus’s impact on the youngest targets. Newborns and babies have so far seemed to be largely unaffected by the coronavirus, but three small new studies suggest that the virus may reach the fetus in utero.
Even in these studies the newborns seem only mildly affected, if at all. That is reassuring, experts said; in theory, the virus could pose a risk to the fetus early in gestation, when the fetal brain is most vulnerable.
After four passengers died aboard Holland America’s Zaandam cruise ship, the fate of the vessel became increasingly unclear on Friday night when it was denied permission to cross the Panama Canal. The ship is currently off the southern coast of Panama, conducting an evacuation of healthy passengers to one of the company’s sister ships, the Rotterdam.
The Panama Canal Authority posted an announcement on Twitter saying that new health regulations aimed at preventing contagious diseases would prohibit the Zaandam from crossing the canal.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain and the health secretary test positive.
In a video message to the British people, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that he tested positive for the novel coronavirus. He also took the message as an opportunity to urge his constituents to practice social distancing.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for the coronavirus and is suffering mild symptoms, he said on Friday. He is the first leader of a major Western country known to have contracted the virus.
“I’ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus,” Mr. Johnson said in a video posted on Twitter, noting that he was tested on Thursday after he began running a temperature and suffering a persistent cough.
“Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight back against coronavirus,” Mr. Johnson said.
But a critical member of his cabinet, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, also tested positive, meaning that the two people most directly responsible for dealing with the virus are now afflicted with it.
The government’s chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, also reported symptoms of the virus and said he was isolating himself. There are fears that other officials who have been in meetings with Mr. Johnson could also have been exposed.
If Mr. Johnson becomes incapacitated, his duties would be taken over by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who has tested negative for the virus. It is a head-spinning turn of events for a government that, just two weeks ago, was brimming with confidence after a landslide election victory in December.
Mr. Johnson’s diagnosis rattled a country that was already unnerved by news that Prince Charles, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II and the heir to the throne, had tested positive for the virus. Buckingham Palace said the queen remained healthy and was sequestered at Windsor Castle. Mr. Johnson delivered his weekly briefing to the queen by telephone on Wednesday.
South Africa, Africa’s most industrialized nation, ordered most of its 59 million people to stay at home for three weeks starting today. It is by far the biggest and most restrictive action undertaken on the African continent to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
The nationwide lockdown followed an alarming increase in confirmed cases across South Africa’s nine provinces. Three weeks after detecting its first infection, the country is now the center of the pandemic on the continent, with more than 1,000 confirmed cases, double the number of the next hardest-hit country, Egypt.
While the deadly virus was slow to take hold in Africa, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths has gradually increased in recent days, raising fears about the continent’s readiness to deal with a pandemic.
To date, 46 African states have reported a total of 3,243 positive cases and 83 deaths, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
You can take several steps to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and keep yourself safe. Be consistent about social distancing. Wash your hands often. And when you do leave your home for groceries or other essentials, wipe down your shopping cart and be smart about what you are purchasing.

For Italians, Dodging Coronavirus Has Become a Game of Chance
Pavia, Italy, has a long history with probability theory. That’s little comfort in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.
PAVIA, Italy — As his glasses fogged up from the mask he wore over his mouth and nose, Riccardo Rosso, a historian of mathematics, scribbled on a blackboard the possible outcomes of a dice game, substituting the chances of getting the coronavirus.
“The concept is the same,” he said. “It is still probability.” But he noted that many variables in the current health emergency were still unknown. So personal interactions — increasing the potential to come in contact with the virus — were probably a bad bet.
That is precisely Italy’s strategy, on a grand scale. Having expanded an initial lockdown of 11 towns first to a northern region of 16 million people, and then to the entire nation — ordering the closure of all businesses except pharmacies and supermarkets on Wednesday — Italy is trying to reduce the chances that its coronavirus epidemic, already the worst in Europe, will spread further.
As it does, caution is mixing with hysteria, paranoia and fear. The question on almost everyone’s mind: What are my chances of getting infected?
[Read: My life on Italy’s coronavirus frontlines, and in quarantine.]
In the intensive care unit of a Pavia hospital, doctors are treating a person known as Patient One, a previously healthy 38-year-old runner who is believed to have helped spread the virus around the Lombardy region.
[Update: Trump’s unilateral travel ban leaves Americans in Europe scrambling to get home.]
The hospital’s doctors are busy calculating the probability of contagion, illness and death. Dr. Raffaele Bruno, director of the infectious disease unit at the San Matteo Hospital in Pavia, said they were compiling a data set to help international colleagues have a better sense of the stakes.
That thinking has imbued modern life. The notion of providing an order and manipulating the odds has influenced thinking on an assortment of public health policies, including seatbelts, bike helmets and smoking bans. An assumed understanding of fixed risks contributes to myriad and subtle daily decisions, as varied as the likelihood of a commuter train derailing and the freshness of supermarket sushi.

The coronavirus destabilizes those quotidian calculations. Activities as mundane as shopping or grabbing a drink with friends can suddenly take on calamitous dimensions.
The random-seeming nature of the virus is unsettling, but the parameters of risk also shift as it spreads, not just by infecting more people and increasing the chance of contagion, but by putting so much stress on health systems that the predicability of care and recovery is no longer certain. The shortage of hospital beds and respirators enters the equation. Triage is a variable.
“You can calculate the odds when you have the numbers,” said Fausto Baldanti, a virologist at the San Matteo Hospital in Pavia. “If you don’t have the numbers, everything is hypothetical.”
He said that the hospital’s early efforts to separate coronavirus patients from others had helped bring the death rate down, as had what he called a “huge expansion of the intensive care units.”
Those rigorous measures in the Lombardy region reduced the number of serious cases and deaths, he noted. Nevertheless the virus’s toll in Italy has continued to rise, this week surpassing 12,000 infections and more than 800 deaths.
Earlier in the week, a doctor in his town had posted on social media a graphic account of the stress on the health system, calling the situation an “epidemiological disaster” that had “overwhelmed” medical workers. Officials at the hospital said on Wednesday that it was close to collapse, with coronavirus patients taking up 60 of its 80 intensive care beds.
Sign up to receive our daily Coronavirus Briefing, an informed guide with the latest developments and expert advice.
Nino Cartabellotta, a prominent public health researcher in Italy, said more than half of the 851 intensive care units in Lombardy were now occupied by coronavirus patients.
“When the system is saturated, death rates spike,” he said, adding that a continuation of the current trend would cause the health care in the north, the jewel of the Italian system and equivalent to or better than that in much of Europe, to collapse. “That’s why it’s important that people stay at home.”
The entire nation must now base behavior on interpretations of percentage points and ratios as Italians seek to reassert a modern sense of control over a virus that feels maddeningly Old World.
Last week, before Italy expanded its restrictions to slow the virus, a group of young women spent the evening playing cards around a small table in the center of Pavia, which is not far from the towns in the initial wave of the lockdown.
“No matter how good you are, if you get lousy cards, you lose,” Giorgia Cassano, 21, said after winning a hand. She said the coronavirus was more or less the same.
“You’ve got to die of something,” Cesarina Gregotti, 71, a retired medical school professor, said last week as she took a stroll after finishing a dry Martini aperitivo, which she hoped would “embalm” any trace of the virus.
A portrait of Cardano, his face gaunt, hangs with other scientific standouts from the University of Pavia, including Alessandro Volta, in the medical museum. Some rooms dedicated to the school’s famous anatomists and biologists had a Frankenstein’s lab feel.
In one glass cabinet sat a jar holding the bladder of Lazzaro Spallanzani, an 18th-century biologist whose name now graces the Rome hospital treating many coronavirus patients.
In another locked cabinet, wax models of smallpox infections stood across from the works of Luigi Sacco, the early Italian vaccinator for whom the Milan hospital treating many of Lombardy’s coronavirus patients is named.
Outside the museum, the grounds were empty of students, as regional officials had ordered the university, founded in 1361, closed. Dr. Marco Benazzo, the head of the university’s medical school, worried about the “exponential” growth of the virus and rushed to an emergency crisis meeting, where he said the number being thrown around for possible infections was at least 15,000.
In the case of the coronavirus, he said, that translated to “taking precautions that go in the direction of improving the parameters” against contagion.
“One day it seemed the plague, the next a simple flu,” Mr. Zanardi said. Some people, he added, had a “psychology of invulnerability” that led them to rebel against precautions.

To Track Coronavirus, Israel Moves to Tap Secret Trove of Cellphone Data
A market in Tel Aviv on Sunday. The Israeli government is escalating efforts to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has authorized the country’s internal security agency to tap into a vast and previously undisclosed trove of cellphone data to retrace the movements of people who have contracted the coronavirus and identify others who should be quarantined because their paths crossed.
The unprecedented move to use data secretly gathered to combat terrorism for public health efforts was debated for hours on Sunday by Mr. Netanyahu’s holdover cabinet.
Mr. Netanyahu then said the government would approve emergency regulations on Monday night that would allow for the use of the data for a limited period of 30 days, with the permission of the attorney general.
[Read: Netanyahu’s bold moves: Fighting a virus or risking democracy?]
The existence of the data trove and the legislative framework under which it is amassed and used have not previously been reported. The plan to apply it to fighting the virus, alluded to only vaguely by Mr. Netanyahu, has not yet been debated by lawmakers or revealed to the public.
The idea is to sift through geolocation data routinely collected from Israeli cellphone providers about millions of their customers in Israel and the West Bank, find people who came into close contact with known virus carriers, and send them text messages directing them to isolate themselves immediately.
In addition to the location-tracking effort, Mr. Netanyahu’s caretaker government on Sunday authorized prison sentences of up to six months for anyone breaching isolation orders; barring visitors, including lawyers, from prison and detention facilities and allowing the police to break up gatherings — as of now, more than 10 people — by means including “the use of reasonable force.”
It is the existence of the cellphone metadata trove and its use to track coronavirus patients and carriers that privacy advocates say poses the greatest test of Israeli democracy at an extraordinarily fragile moment.

“Even in crises of this nature, the core of civil rights in a democracy must be preserved,” Mr. Blass said in an interview. “I understand that infection and contagion and the spread of the virus must be prevented, but it is inconceivable that because of the panic, civil rights should be trampled without restraint, at levels that are totally disproportionate to the threat and the problem.”
“The use of advanced Shin Bet technologies is intended for one purpose only: saving lives,” said a senior security official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss such a sensitive matter. “In this way, the spread of the virus in Israel can be narrowed, quickly and efficiently. This is a focused, time-limited and limited activity that is monitored by the government, the attorney general and the Knesset’s regulatory mechanisms.”
If the virus is putting Israel’s democratic norms to the test, the lack of a broader immediate outcry suggested that people may be fairly tolerant.

“Like in every country, there are things that happen secretly, and that’s a good thing so long as there is oversight,” said Ran Sa’ar, chief executive of Maccabi Health Services, Israel’s second-largest health fund, with 2.4 million members.
Saying there could be many as-yet-unknown carriers of the virus in Israel, Mr. Sa’ar said the country could soon be overwhelmed if it did not identify them before their numbers grow to tens of thousands. “If we can locate them, it will help,” he said.
Using cellphone data to combat the coronavirus requires government approval because the Security Agency Law limits the Shin Bet’s role to protecting Israel “against threats of terror, sabotage, subversion, espionage and exposure of state secrets.” It is permitted to act in other ways “vital to national security” but only with the approval of the cabinet and the Secret Services Subcommittee.

‘Every One of Us Has a Critical Role’: Trump Releases New Coronavirus Guidelines
President Trump and leading health officials are now recommending closing more schools, avoiding groups of more than 10, discretionary travel, bars and restaurants.
Trump released national guidelines to control the virus.
The Trump administration released new guidelines on Monday to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including closing schools and avoiding groups of more than 10 people, discretionary travel, bars, restaurants and food courts.
Mr. Trump, flanked by task force members including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the guidelines would apply for 15 days.
“It seems to me if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that’s much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August,” Mr. Trump said about the duration of the crisis.
The new measures reflected the increasing gravity of global attempts to contain the virus as governments around the world, from Canada to Hungary, moved to close their borders to foreign travelers. They left unanswered the question of precisely what individuals and local governments should do, or how business owners and workers might survive financially, at a time when vast sections of the economy were ceasing to function.
“If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now,” Mr. Trump said, “we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration all together.”
Hours earlier, Mr. Trump told a group of governors they should not wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators needed to help people diagnosed with coronavirus.
Trump’s Call With Governors on the Coronavirus
President Trump held a call with governors on Monday about the response to the coronavirus, discussing work on a vaccine, the impact on the economy and more.
The suggestion surprised some of the governors, who have been scrambling to contain the outbreak and looking to the federal government for help with equipment, personnel and financial aid.
At the briefing with the president, Dr. Fauci said the first phase of testing of a possible vaccine had begun on Monday. He stressed that some of the White House guidelines were inconvenient, but that they would help stop the spread of the virus and were not an overreaction.
“When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak,” he said, “you are always behind where you think you are.”
Measures to slow the virus are slowing the economy, too.
It was clear on Monday that most of the American economy was grinding to a halt, and would remain that way for months, because of the coronavirus outbreak and the sweeping steps being taken to try to halt it.
On Wall Street, brokers and analysts were acting as if an economic collapse were inevitable, despite the Federal Reserve’s emergency moves on Sunday night to stoke economic growth through an aggressive bond-buying program. The S&P 500 fell nearly 12 percent on Monday and global oil prices slid below $30 a barrel, a four-year low.
Employers and employees are torn between fears of being exposed to the virus and fears of running out of money to pay for food and electricity. And government officials are left with the unhappy task of shutting down businesses that provide wages for large swaths of their communities, while wondering what steps their neighbors are taking.

The consequences of China’s harsh measures to halt the virus — restricting the movement of about 700 million people at one point — became apparent on Monday when the government released economic data showing industrial output falling to its lowest level in decades and unemployment rising at its highest rate ever in February.
‘Our Lives Are at Stake’: U.S. Residents Scramble to Find Coronavirus Testing
Since March 3, the Trump administration has said coronavirus testing is available to all. But people across the country told us that’s not the case.
The Derby, the first jewel of horse racing’s Triple Crown, became the latest marquee sporting event forced to postpone because of the deepening coronavirus pandemic.
The coronavirus has transformed the sporting landscape. The N.B.A., the N.H.L. and Major League Baseball have all suspended play, and the N.C.A.A. canceled all of its championships.
Latin America begins grappling with the virus.
Stringent measures were imposed over the weekend in several Latin American nations, where the outbreak has generally arrived later than in Europe or North America.
In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro — an authoritarian leader whose government is considered illegitimate by the United States and about 60 other nations — seized on the upheaval caused by the pandemic to present himself as a responsible guardian of public health.
On Monday night, in an announcement made on state TV, Mr. Maduro said a nationwide quarantine would take effect Tuesday at 5 a.m. local time. The country is now at 33 cases, according to Mr. Maduro, who called the move “a drastic and necessary measure.”
Earlier in the day, he responded to 17 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country by ordering a lockdown of the capital, Caracas, and six other states on Monday. “We either go into quarantine, or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country,” he said in a terse televised speech on Sunday that was a departure from his typically rambling addresses. He called on the United States to loosen sanctions against his government.
Other Latin American countries have also responded to dozens of confirmed cases. Ecuador and Peru announced countrywide lockdowns. President Iván Duque of Colombia shut the borders to nonresidents. In Costa Rica, the government decreed a state of emergency that included closing its borders.
In contrast, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil encouraged mass demonstrations by his supporters against his opponents in Congress on Sunday. Though Mr. Bolsonaro has been close to people who tested positive for the virus, he shook hands and posed for photos with supporters.
Scientists tracking the spread of the coronavirus reported Monday that, for every confirmed case, there are most likely another five to 10 people in the community with undetected infections. On average these people are about half as infectious as confirmed ones, but they are responsible for transmitting the virus in nearly 80 percent of new cases, according to the report, which was based on data from China.
Sign up to receive our daily Coronavirus Briefing, an informed guide with the latest developments and expert advice.
The researchers modeled the virus’s natural spread in China before the government instituted a travel ban and an aggressive testing policy. During that time, from December 2019 through late January, about 85 percent of cases went undetected. That situation is analogous to the current state of affairs in the United States and other Western countries, where tests are not widely available, the researchers said.
“If we have 3,500 confirmed cases in the U.S., you might be looking at 35,000 in reality,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and the senior author of the new report, which was posted by the journal Science.
The report is among the first to address two pressing questions: How many people are walking around with unrecognized infections, and how infectious are they? American policymakers have begun taking more aggressive measures to slow transmission, like canceling events and closing restaurants, but access to tests has been difficult or nonexistent in much of the country.
“We propose to introduce a temporary restriction to non-essential travel to the European Union,” said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, after a teleconference with G7 leaders. “Of course there will be exemptions for E.U. citizens coming back home, health care workers, doctors and nurses.”
Infighting, turf wars and a president more concerned with the stock market and media coverage than policy have defined the Trump White House. They have also defined how it has handled a pandemic.
The White House culture that President Trump has fostered and abided by for more than three years has shaped his administration’s response to a deadly pandemic that is upending his presidency and the rest of the country, with dramatic changes to how Americans live their daily lives.
Health officials order millions in the Bay Area to “shelter in place.”
Six counties in Northern California have ordered all residents to “shelter in place” in an effort to stop the coronavirus from surging.
That means staying at home except for the most essential reasons. Officials said people would be allowed to leave the house for essential work, to go to a grocery store, pick up medication, or even walk the dog. But they urged everyone to practice social distancing while outside. “It is now time to do your part,” Dr. Scott Morrow, the San Mateo health officer, said in a statement.
“It’s asking people to go home with their families and to stay there until they are told otherwise,” said Mayor Joe Goethals of San Mateo, adding that only “essential” businesses like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies would remain open.
The number of coronavirus cases in the United States crossed the 4,000 mark on Monday, with more than 70 deaths, including the first deaths in Indiana, Nevada and South Carolina.
A growing number of cities and states have taken significant actions to slow the coronavirus, shutting down schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms. The restrictions stretched from the now-empty sidewalks of New York City, where officials had made the wrenching decision to shut down public schools, to the fields and urban centers of Ohio. Millions of Americans are now hunkered down at home for the foreseeable future.
France imposes a nationwide lockdown.
Olivier Véran, France’s health minister, said that the government was asking each French person to limit human contact to a maximum of five people a day. France, with more than 6,600 coronavirus cases and 148 deaths by Monday, had already ordered all “non-indispensable” businesses closed.
“We will be able to end the confinement,” Mr. Véran said in a post on Twitter. “But without confinement, we will not be able to end the epidemic.”
Spain, with almost 10,000 cases and more than 300 deaths by Monday, also ordered residents to mostly stay at home, though it is still allowing most people to go to work and has not announced any punitive measures. Schools, restaurants and bars were ordered to close.
The pace of new coronavirus infections reported in Europe accelerates daily — roughly 6,000 on Thursday, 7,000 on Friday, 8,000 on Saturday, 9,000 on Sunday and 10,000 on Monday, bringing the total to about 62,000. France and Spain warned that their health care systems could be overwhelmed.
And in Italy, still the hardest-hit country in Europe and the first to impose nationwide restrictions on movement, the government announced $28 billion in emergency aid to individuals, businesses and the health care system to stave off chaos and financial ruin.
Italy had almost 28,000 infections and more than 1,800 deaths as of Monday.
Ohio’s governor on Monday night said he and top state heath officials would ignore a court ruling and postpone Ohio’s presidential primary by declaring a public health emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The governor, Mike DeWine, said that the state’s health director, Dr. Amy Acton, had issued the order based on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak placed both voters and poll workers in potential danger.
Ohio was one of four states scheduled to vote on Tuesday. The other three — Arizona, Illinois and Florida — said that they planned to proceed with their elections while taking additional health precautions.
U.S. airlines ask for $50 billion in emergency support from the government.
Mr. Johnson and his government had faced harsh criticism for its laissez-faire approach to the pandemic. They had spoken hopefully of “herd immunity” — in which many people would be infected, recover and then, it is hoped, be immune — while it was inevitable that many people would take ill and die.
But at a news conference on Monday with top medical officials, he said: “Now is the time for everyone to stop nonessential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.”
The English actor Idris Elba, who was in the HBO series “The Wire,” announced on Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, sharing the news with fans in a video that he posted on Twitter.
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York announced on Saturday that the state’s presidential primary would be postponed until June because of the coronavirus outbreak.
President Trump backtracked on Saturday night after earlier in the day floating the possibility of imposing an “enforceable” travel quarantine on the New York region.
Mr. Cuomo, in an interview with CNN, expressed frustration and confusion over Mr. Trump’s vague suggestion that he was considering somehow sealing off New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which has the New York City area as its epicenter.
But on Saturday night, Mr. Trump appeared to abandon the proposal, announcing on Twitter that, “A quarantine will not be necessary.”
Earlier, Mr. Trump, speaking on the White House lawn, had said he was considering imposing what he called, without elaborating, an “enforceable” quarantine that would restrict travel in and out of New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut.

“They’re having problems down in Florida,” Mr. Trump said. “A lot of New Yorkers going down, we don’t want that, heavily infected.”

The statewide death toll has reached 728, and the total number of cases stands at more than 52,000. More than 7,300 people are currently hospitalized.
On Saturday night, New York City officials reported a sharp jump in deaths from Friday night, saying that 222 people had died in that 24-hour window, bringing the total to 672 people. That is the largest number of reported deaths in a single 24-hour period in the city.  
Four new emergency medical sites have been approved — in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens and on Staten Island — that would add another 4,000 hospital beds. Some city hospitals will also soon be reserved for treating coronavirus patients exclusively.
The governor said the state Department of Health had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to start an antibody test to determine whether people have been infected with the virus and whether “they have an immunity to the antibodies.”
The U.S.N.S. Comfort, a Navy ship with medical personnel and 1,000 beds, is on its way to New York from Virginia and is set to arrive on Monday. “We’ll use this to backfill and take pressure off a hospital,” Mr. Cuomo said.
A detective is the first N.Y.P.D. officer to die from the virus.
A veteran detective with the New York City Police Department has died of complications from the coronavirus, the department said Saturday.
Detective Cedric Dixon worked in the 32nd Precinct, in Harlem, and had worked for the department for 23 years, officials said. He is the first officer from the Police Department to die from the virus.
Two civilian employees of the police department also died this week after becoming infected with the virus. Dennis Dixon, 62, died Thursday. Mr. Dixon was a custodian who worked at Police Headquarters in downtown Manhattan. Later Thursday, Giacomina Barr-Brown, 61, died from complications of the virus. Ms. Barr-Brown worked in the roll call office in the 49th precinct.
According to data released by the department on Friday, 442 officers and 70 civilian employees of the police department had tested positive for the virus. A total of 4,111 uniformed employees were out sick, which is about 11 percent of the department’s police force.
The department has faced criticism in recent weeks for not properly outfitting officers with protective equipment, like gloves and masks. Earlier this month, as the coronavirus crisis worsened in the city, the city’s largest police union filed a lawsuit against the department accusing it of failing to provide necessary equipment to protect officers from the virus.
New Jersey’s death toll reaches 140.
Governor Murphy reported 2,289 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, bringing New Jersey’s total to 11,124, and 32 additional deaths, bringing the number to 140.

“This is a pass-fail test,” Mr. Murphy said. “This is life or death.”
The governor also said that major banks in New Jersey had agreed to a 90-day grace period on late mortgage payments for borrowers who had lost their jobs or were working less because of the pandemic.
On a different front, the colonel of the State Police, Patrick Callahan, said police dispatchers in New Jersey could now identify households with people who had tested positive for the virus, allowing officers to take extra precautions when answering emergency calls at those locations.
At least 700 police officers and troopers in the state have tested positive for the virus, the colonel said.
Rhode Island backs down after taking “unusual” steps to target New Yorkers over the virus.
Several governors this week ordered people traveling from New York to self-quarantine for two weeks upon arriving, hoping to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus in their states.
“The Governor’s top priority is keeping Rhode Islanders safe,’’ Josh Block, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement. “New York is a hot spot of this epidemic, and as a matter of public safety, it was critical to ensure travelers from New York are self-quarantining to avoid unnecessary spread. That said, the Governor has said all along that she is taking a data-driven approach, and this situation is constantly evolving,”  
“As other cities and states across the country are now seeing a spike in cases,’’ Mr. Block added, “she signed a new Executive Order expanding the quarantine requirement to all out-of-state travelers.”
Ms. Raimondo had insisted that her emergency powers gave her the authority to impose the measures, but the American Civil Liberties Union called her move an “ill-advised and unconstitutional plan.”
About 10 percent of the shelters in New York City’s main shelter system have now been affected by the spread of the coronavirus, and the number of people living in shelters and infected with the virus has climbed to 70, officials said.
Out of about 450 traditional shelters, commercial hotels and private apartment buildings used to house homeless people, 45 shelters have had individuals who have stayed there test positive for the virus, according to the Department of Social Services.
Two of the people, a man in his 60s and a man in his 70s, died this week after being hospitalized. As of Friday, 26 remained hospitalized, the social services agency reported.
The nature of single-adult shelters, where people sleep in dormitory-style quarters and share bathrooms, has posed a unique challenge to those trying to comply with rules for social distancing meant to help contain the spread of the virus.
But more homeless people outside of the shelters are contracting the virus. The social services agency reported that four people who were living unsheltered had been confirmed as having been infected.
To try to reduce the virus’s spread, the agency has set up special isolation units at three locations for people who have either tested positive themselves or have been exposed to people who did. As of Friday, 122 people were staying in the units.
Women preparing to give birth at some hospitals in New York City will no longer have to labor alone, nor will they need to remain isolated from their partner or family while recovering in the hospital after delivery, state officials said.
Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to Governor Cuomo, said that an executive order would be issued on Saturday requiring all New York hospitals, both public and private, to comply.
The move came after a decision this week by two major New York City hospital systems, NewYork-Presbyterian and Mount Sinai, to ban support people — such as spouses, family members and doulas — from labor and delivery rooms because of the coronavirus pandemic.
NewYork-Presbyterian said in a statement on Saturday that it would comply with the requirement, and Mount Sinai said it would as well. The Department of Health had notified hospitals on Friday that they were required to allow one person to accompany a woman through labor and delivery.
“I’m days away from my due date, and I’m trying to mentally prepare for both scenarios,” said Kate Dinota, 32, who plans to give birth at Weill Cornell Medical Center.
NewYork-Presbyterian changed its policies after pregnant women who were positive for Covid-19 but asymptomatic exposed more than 30 hospital workers to the virus.

The Coronavirus Outbreak
Doctors are increasingly anxious that New York — like other states — won’t have enough of the breathing machines that are key to fighting the coronavirus.
As the coronavirus has swept across New York, officials have become increasingly alarmed about a bleak reality: The state may not have enough ventilators for everybody who could need one.
It is still possible that the state could slow down the spread of the virus enough to curb the demand for ventilators, the machines that help the sickest patients to breathe. But a panel convened a few years ago by the state found that in the worst-case scenario of a flulike pandemic, New York could be short by as many as 15,783 ventilators a week at the peak of the crisis.
UPDATE Trump administration pulls back on $1 billion coronavirus ventilators deal.
The panel, the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, studied ventilators for years before issuing a 2015 report offering guidance for hospitals on how to decide who to ventilate and who to effectively let die during an emergency. The advice is now frighteningly relevant.
Most of the New York’s major health systems have declined to provide details about their ventilators or what they will do if they run out. Some hospital administrators have said they believe new measures, such as closures of schools and restaurants, can slow the spread of the virus and keep the number of critically ill people below levels that could overwhelm hospitals.
In interviews, ventilator manufacturers warned that, amid the pandemic, they do not have the ability to provide New York more ventilators — which can cost at least $25,000 apiece and require significant training to use.
“I’m nervous,” said Dr. Akshay Ganju, an emergency room physician in Westchester County. “I’m steeling myself for the possibility that at some point I’m going to have to look a daughter in the eye and tell her that I don’t have a ventilator for her father.”
Ventilator shortages are already a reality elsewhere, such as Italy, where the high number of coronavirus patients flooded the system, leading some doctors to say they had to choose putting only younger patients on ventilators because they have more life to live.

New York’s hospitals are considered to be among the best in the world. But the state has slightly fewer ventilators per capita than the national average, according to a New York Times comparison of the 2015 state task force report and a study by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
The task force found that in 2015, there were about 7,250 ventilators in New York hospitals and about 1,900 in nursing homes. But the vast majority of them were already being used. Even with the state’s own emergency stockpile, the group found there were only 2,800 available.
The New York State Department of Health has declined to provide updated numbers.
In New York City, Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade organization, said that as of last count, there were slightly more than 2,000 ventilators available, after accounting for ones already in use.
The task force estimated that in a severe pandemic similar to the 1918 Spanish flu — which killed more than 50 million people worldwide — about 18,600 New York patients would need ventilators each week at the peak of such a crisis.
“We are recommending that we prepare for a 1918 type scenario,” said Crystal Watson of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
It is impossible to know how bad the coronavirus pandemic will be. Some experts have said that it will not be as bad as the Spanish flu, which tended to cut down not the elderly but younger people, some collapsing just hours after the first onset of symptoms.

“The fact is that if the pandemic got so bad that we were using all the ventilators, we likely wouldn’t have enough staff to operate them anyway,” said Beth Roxland, a bioethicist who served as executive director of the state’s task force.
The task force was created in 1985 to examine a number of ethical issues in health care. Throughout the years, it issued reports on several topics. Its ventilator report in 2015 said that during the shortage, hospitals should focus on helping children and the patients most likely to survive the pandemic. The guidelines included a formula of medical criteria and also envisioned a lottery system in some instances. They recommended against moving ventilators from nursing homes into hospitals.
Only a few hospital systems have so far been willing to say publicly what they would do if they have more patients in need of ventilation than machines.
Northwell Health, which has 23 hospitals, and Montefiore Medical Center, with 11 hospitals, both said that if supplies ran out, they would adopt the task force guidelines.
New York City’s Health and Hospitals Corporation, the city’s public hospital system, said it had no plans to implement the triage in the guidelines, and that every patient who needs a ventilator will get one. It said it would not remove a patient from a ventilator, if it was medically necessary for them to be on it.
Mount Sinai Health System and NYU Langone Medical Center declined to answer questions.
Adding to the strain is the fact that some patients on ventilators have remained on them for weeks, before dying or recovering. The state guidelines in the report suggested giving patients 120 hours on ventilator therapy to show improvement before removing them and giving the ventilator to someone else. But some coronavirus patients may need longer to recover.
A huge question is what percentage of coronavirus patients will need ventilators. So far in New York City, approximately 25 percent of confirmed cases have been hospitalized, and 44 percent of those have required ventilation, according to the city Health Department.
Some experts said hospitals could turn to other solutions in a ventilator shortage.
Laura Forese, executive vice president of NewYork-Presbyterian, said that canceling elective surgeries — as some hospitals have done — meant that more anesthesia machines were now available. Those could now be used as ventilators for coronavirus patients, she said.
One task force member, Samuel Gorovitz, a professor of philosophy at Syracuse University, said it was too late for hospitals to address the ventilator shortfall. He said officials should have paid more attention to the task force report.

The Coronavirus Outbreak
Behind the Virus Report That Jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to Action
Now, Mr. Gove and Mr. Johnson are leading the British government as it confronts the calamity of the coronavirus, and Mr. Johnson, now the prime minister, insists the process is being guided by experts. The trouble is, those experts can often disagree with each other or change their minds about the right course of action.
That messy back-and-forth has been on vivid display this week with the publication of a startling new report on the virus from a team at Imperial College in London. The report, which warned that an uncontrolled spread of the disease could cause as many as 510,000 deaths in Britain, triggered a sudden shift in the government’s comparatively relaxed response to the virus.
American officials said the report, which projected up to 2.2 million deaths in the United States from such a spread, also influenced the White House to strengthen its measures to isolate members of the public.
Imperial College has advised the government on its response to previous epidemics, including SARS, avian flu and swine flu. With ties to the World Health Organization and a team of 50 scientists, led by a prominent epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, Imperial is treated as a sort of gold standard, its mathematical models feeding directly into government policies.
But outside experts pointed out that the report’s alarming conclusions — that the virus would overwhelm hospitals and that governments had no choice but to impose radical lockdown policies — had been made in previous reports on coronavirus or on social media sites devoted to the outbreak.
Latest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak
C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
“A lot of it is not what they say, but who says it,” said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. “Neil Ferguson has a huge amount of influence.”
Imperial College, experts noted, was part of the advisory group for the government’s now-abandoned strategy, which played down radical social distancing and accepted that the infection would spread through the population. The theory is that this would build up so-called “herd immunity,” so that the public would be more resistant in the face of a second wave of infections next winter.
But such a strategy, the report noted, would lead to a flood of critically ill patients in a country without enough beds. Instead, it said, Britain needs to pursue “suppression,” which involves far stricter lockdowns, like the closing of schools and the quarantine of infected people and their families. That would drive down the number of cases and spread out the flow of patients over a longer period, allowing hospitals to cope.
Dr. Ferguson has been candid that the report reached new conclusions because of the latest data from Italy, which has seen a spiraling rate of infections, swamping hospitals and forcing doctors to make agonizing decisions about who to treat.
“The U.K. has struggled in the past few weeks in thinking about how to handle this outbreak long term,” Dr. Ferguson said in an interview on Monday, just after the report was released. “Based on our estimates and other teams’, there’s really no option but follow in China’s footsteps and suppress.”
The report added, “this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK.”

But other experts said the burden on hospitals was clear as far back as the original outbreak in Wuhan, China. Lancet, the British medical journal, published an article in January, based on studying a small group of patients, which found that a third of people had to be admitted to intensive care units.
“I can’t help but feel angry that it has taken almost two months for politicians and even ‘experts’ to understand the scale of the danger from SARS-CoV-2,” said Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of Lancet, on Twitter. “Those dangers were clear from the very beginning.”
Some said governments should treat the report’s projections about suppression policies with the same caution. It says social distancing measures might have to be imposed for 18 months or more, at least intermittently, until a vaccine is developed and tested. But the report acknowledges this is uncertain, given the possibility of drug treatments and the mystery of how the virus is transmitted.
“We’re all using the 1918 pandemic flu handbook,” Dr. Sridhar said. “But we’re in a different position than in 1918. We’re in 2020.”
After days of confusion about the wisdom of encouraging “herd immunity,” the government sought to play down the dispute, arguing that this was not a deliberate part of its strategy but a byproduct of it. But it shifted to a policy of urging people not to go to pubs, restaurants, theaters or museums.
British officials recognize that their health service faces a moment of truth. All non-urgent operations in England will be postponed for at least three months, starting April 15, to free up 30,000 beds to help tackle the coronavirus.
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.

Crackdown on Southern Border Is Planned; U.S. Records 100th Death
This briefing has ended. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
Deaths in U.S. pass 100 as the coronavirus reaches all 50 states.
The virus could possibly survive in the air, a new study suggests.
Parts of the U.S. could run out of hospital beds.
The Trump administration plans to immediately turn back all asylum seekers and other foreigners attempting to enter the United States from Mexico illegally, saying the nation cannot risk allowing the coronavirus to spread through detention facilities and Border Patrol agents, four administration officials said.
Although they advised that details could change before the announcement, administration officials said the measure was needed to avert what they fear could be a systemwide outbreak of the coronavirus inside detention facilities along the border. Such an outbreak could spread quickly through the immigrant population and could infect large numbers of Border Patrol agents, leaving the southwestern border defenses weakened, the officials argued.
Administration officials say many of the migrants who cross the border are already sick or lack sufficient documents detailing their medical history.
Confirmed cases of the virus in Mexico stand at 82, compared with around 5,600 in the United States and more than 470 in Canada. But Mr. Trump has suggested closing the border many times in the past, hoping to crack down on illegal immigration and press Mexico to do more to curb the northward flow of migrants.
Deaths in U.S. pass 100 as the coronavirus reaches all 50 states.
At least 100 deaths in the United States have now been linked to the coronavirus, according to a New York Times database that is tracking and mapping every known case in the country as more people are tested. On Tuesday evening, West Virginia became the 50th state to report a case.
The 101 deaths, all announced in the last three weeks, came as the number of known coronavirus cases in the United States soared past 5,600 on Tuesday. Hundreds more people are learning they have the illness each day, including more than 800 diagnoses on both Monday and Tuesday, as the nation’s testing capacity has grown significantly and as the virus spreads.
About half the country’s reported deaths have been in Washington State, including at least 30 linked to a long-term care facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. Residents of at least two more long-term care facilities in Washington, plus others in Kansas and South Carolina, have also died, underscoring the elevated risks for older adults and people with underlying health problems.
Most of those who have died from the virus have been in their 60s or older, and several have been in their 90s. But other patients who died have been younger, including a corrections worker in New York City in his 50s and a man from the Seattle area in his 40s.
Though Washington, New York and California account for about two-thirds of the country’s coronavirus deaths, 14 other states have reported at least one fatal case of the illness.
European leaders voted Tuesday to close off at least 26 countries to nearly all visitors from the rest of the world for at least 30 days in a bid to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, starting a long stretch of isolation like nothing in modern European history outside wartime.
The travel ban — which Britain did not plan to participate in — represented the first coordinated response to the epidemic by the European Union.
Special exceptions would be made for European citizens and residents coming home, although some countries were asking them to self-isolate for two weeks, in some cases away from their families. Medical professionals and scientists would be exempt from the measures, as would people living in one European country and commuting to another for work.

N.Y.C. Mayor Bill de Blasio: City has one week’s worth of medical supplies
C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
It was the most dramatic action on a day that the Continent continued to grapple with the growing coronavirus crisis, as some countries restricted the movements of their citizens and others proposed relief packages to try to contain the economic damage.
Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, announced a €200 billion relief aid package on Tuesday — equivalent to one-fifth of Spain’s gross domestic product — to help alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic. At least 491 people have died in the country and there have been 11,178 confirmed cases.
The death of Spain’s youngest known victim so far, Francisco García, 21, struck a chord with the nation. Mr. García, a soccer coach from Málaga, did not know he had an underlying condition when he went to the hospital. But he was soon hit with a double dose of bad news: He was infected with the coronavirus and he had leukemia. He died on Sunday.
Germany raced to bring home thousands of its citizens, its government spending more than $55 million on logistics and flights as nations tighten their borders and travel becomes exceedingly difficult. Turkey reported its first death caused by the coronavirus. And the Russian government prepared to block most foreigners from entering the country starting Wednesday. Moscow banned events of more than 50 people and ordered schools closed starting Saturday.
After weeks of being cut off from the outside world, the contestants on the German version of “Big Brother” were told about the pandemic in a special live show on Tuesday. Several of the 14 contestants, who had been sequestered since Feb. 6, erupted into sobs when the host explained that the disease had reached Europe and showed news clips of recent events.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the administration is considering sending checks to Americans over the next two weeks to cushion the economic blow of the pandemic.
As the growing economic toll of the coronavirus became clearer, the White House said it supported the idea of sending cash payments directly to Americans as part of a broader $850 billion stimulus proposal that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed on Tuesday with Republicans on Capitol Hill.
It was a shift in priority for the administration, which has been advocating a payroll tax cut, and it came as the coronavirus ground large swaths of the economy to a halt. Mr. Mnuchin noted that the effects of a payroll tax cut would take months to reach people.
‘Our Lives Are at Stake’: U.S. Residents Scramble to Find Coronavirus Testing
Since March 3, the Trump administration has said coronavirus testing is available to all. But people across the country told us that’s not the case.

The virus has infected more than 678,900 people in at least 171 countries.
The virus could possibly survive in the air, a new study suggests.
The coronavirus can live for three days on some surfaces, like plastic and steel — though the amount of viable virus decreases sharply over this time — suggests a new study, published on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Experts say the risk of consumers getting infected from touching those materials is still low, though they offered additional warnings about how long the virus could survive in the air, which may have important implications for medical workers.
When the virus becomes suspended in droplets smaller than five micrometers — known as aerosols — it can stay suspended for about 30 minutes, before drifting down and settling on surfaces where it can linger for hours, the researchers said. The finding is inconsistent with the World Health Organization’s position that the virus is not transported by air.
The new study also suggests that the virus can survive up to 24 hours on cardboard packages, though it disintegrates over the course of a day — meaning cardboard packages that arrive in the mail would have only low levels of the virus unless the delivery person has coughed or sneezed on it or has handled it with contaminated hands.
Another study, the largest to date of children and the virus, has found that while most develop mild or moderate symptoms, a small percentage — especially babies and preschoolers — can become seriously ill. Children account for the smallest percentage of the tens of thousands of infections identified globally.
The study, published online in the journal Pediatrics, looked at more than 2,000 ill children across China, where the pandemic began. It provides a clearer portrait of how the youngest patients are affected by the virus, knowledge that experts say can help influence policies like school closures, hospital preparedness and the deployment of an eventual treatment and vaccine.
The Federal Aviation Administration closed the lone air traffic control tower at Chicago Midway International Airport on Tuesday after three technicians at the facility tested positive for the coronavirus, an agency spokesman said.
And across the country, public transit agencies have struggled amid low ridership and health concerns from their employees and customers. New York City’s public transportation system, the largest in North America, is seeking a $4 billion federal bailout as the pandemic set off an extraordinary free fall in ridership.
He also said restrictions on businesses and hospitals had deprived the drivers of places on their routes to visit restrooms and wash their hands.
Parts of the U.S. could run out of hospital beds.
A new Harvard analysis shows that many parts of the United States would have far too few hospital beds if the new coronavirus continues to spread widely and nothing is done to expand capacity.
In 40 percent of markets around the country, hospitals would not be able to make enough room for all Covid-19 patients even if they were completely emptied of other patients. That statistic assumes that 40 percent of all adults become infected with the virus over 12 months, a scenario described as “moderate” by the team behind the calculations.
Around the country, hospitals have begun canceling elective operations and speeding patients with less critical ailments home, to make beds available for possible coronavirus patients.
Yet the Harvard estimates suggest that much more may be needed. In hard-hit Italy, hospitals have resorted to rationing care for older patients who are severely ill with the virus.

Stocks on Wall Street rebounded after another emergency step by the Fed.
Stocks rose on Tuesday, lifted by the latest emergency measure from the Federal Reserve to keep money flowing through the economy and talk of further stimulus efforts in Washington. They made up some of the ground lost on Monday in the sharpest drop since the coronavirus outbreak began.
But the tone of the trading was tentative. The best-performing parts of the market were traditionally safe and staid sectors like utilities and consumer staples, where risk-averse investors hide during trying economic times. Reflecting concern about the global economy, oil prices fell.
There are few historical parallels for the market shock waves created by the outbreak. From still-closed factories in China to Western nations where millions of people are living in a state of semi-house arrest, most of the engines that keep the global economy aloft have sputtered to a halt at the same time.
Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said that residents should prepare for the possibility of a “shelter in place” order to be announced in the next 48 hours, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in New York City neared 1,000.
Mr. de Blasio said the city was also rushing to add more hospital beds.
With states postponing upcoming primaries to avoid congregating during the coronavirus pandemic, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez on Tuesday urged the states left to vote to conduct all vote-by-mail contests.
Voters did not go to the polls Tuesday in Ohio, where the presidential primary was postponed after state officials declared a public health emergency — but the primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois went ahead as scheduled. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won all three states, according to The Associated Press.
The outgoing White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, is in self-quarantine.
Mick Mulvaney, the outgoing acting White House chief of staff, is in self-quarantine in his home state of South Carolina, after his niece, with whom he shares an apartment in Washington, fell ill and is awaiting test results, according to four people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Mulvaney took a test for the coronavirus last week and the results were negative, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. But the results of the test that his niece, Maggie, took are not back yet, the person said.
The same weekend, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil dined with Mr. Trump. One of Mr. Bolsonaro’s aides who was present has since tested positive for the coronavirus.
Cases spike in Brazil as it reports its first death
Health officials in Brazil reported a sharp rise in confirmed cases and the country’s first coronavirus-related death on Tuesday. The 62-year-old patient who died had diabetes and high blood pressure, and was not among the confirmed cases health officials were tracking.
As of Tuesday, officials said, Brazil had 290 confirmed cases and suspected several thousand more.
Brazil and several of its neighbors announced new actions to fight the spread of the virus. Airlines suspended international flights and local officials curbed train and bus service. Following Colombia’s lead, Brazil closed its border with Venezuela.
President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, who declared a nationwide quarantine on Monday, requested a $5 billion assistance package from the International Monetary Fund, an institution he has previously disparaged.

‘Proselytizing Robots’: Inside South Korean Church at Outbreak’s Center
Even before the coronavirus scourge, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus was viewed suspiciously. Now it has become the most vilified church in South Korea.
SEOUL, South Korea — More than 1.2 million citizens have called for the secretive church to be disbanded. One province asked the public to report church members to a hotline for coronavirus testing. Smartphone apps help identify the church’s 1,100 once-obscure facilities in South Korea, most already plastered with “off-limits” signs by disease-control officials.
Even before the coronavirus scourge, South Korea’s Shincheonji Church of Jesus had faced increased suspicion over its tactics to attract tens of thousands of recruits. But in the month since the church was identified as the epicenter of infections in the country, it has become the target of scorn, vilification and open hatred.
A large majority of the country’s more than 7,500 coronavirus patients are Shincheonji members in Daegu, a city in the southeast, or people who had come into contact with them. An additional cluster of cases has emerged in Cheongdo, a county near Daegu that is Mr. Lee’s birthplace and a regular pilgrimage destination for his followers.
“The entire society has gone berserk against our church since the virus outbreak,” said Lee Young-Soo, 54, a Shincheonji member whose sister, a fellow church member, died after having fallen from her seventh-floor apartment in the southern city of Ulsan last month. Ms. Lee said her sister had confided that her husband’s long-running abuse over her church   had intensified after the virus outbreak.
Still, the church is inextricably linked to the spread of the affliction in South Korea, one of the largest outbreaks outside China.
The church’s clandestine nature is part of what made it a focal point for the country’s anger and fear. Officials have struggled to locate and screen church members for the virus.
Kwon Jun-Wook, a senior disease-control official, said last month that when officials had tried to reach church members, they found many incommunicado. Daegu’s mayor said Tuesday that dozens of Shincheonji members must be immediately tested for the coronavirus or face fines. The city of Seoul has accused Mr. Lee and his disciples of failing to provide full membership lists.

Once they passed written tests after months of Bible studies, converts became participants in a spectacular commencement ceremony. Life as a church member included meetings, proselytizing missions on the streets and daily progress reports on how many people they had tried to recruit and how their recruits were doing in Bible studies, former members said.
The practice of disavowing membership carried over to how at least some church members responded to the coronavirus outbreak. South Koreans were outraged when it was revealed last month that church members had received a message telling them to deny their affiliation with Shincheonji and to keep proselytizing even after the outbreak was reported among its congregation.
While Shincheonji’s recruitment methods have drawn recent condemnation for helping spread the virus, its approach has long galled more mainstream churches, which have accused it of sending undercover proselytizers, known as harvesters, into their congregations and stealing members.
Mr. Lee has defended the church’s response to the outbreak, and Shincheonji has issued statements through a spokesman repeating that the church was cooperating with the government and demanding an end to “scapegoating.”
How the church conducts gatherings, however, has drawn scrutiny as a spreader of the disease. Worshipers sit packed tightly on the floor and attend even when sick, former members say.
“We were taught not to be afraid of illness,” said Lee Ho-yeon, who left the church in 2015. A church leader boasted to followers on Feb. 9 that although hundreds of people had died in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began, no Shincheonji worshipers there became sick, according to the audio file of the sermon released by Yoon Jae-Deok, an expert on religious groups like Shincheonji.
The crowded conditions of Shincheonji churches did make them more vulnerable to contagious diseases, said Hwang Gui-hag, the editor in chief of the Seoul-based Law Times, which specializes in church news.
But he said that in his view, the central and regional governments, caught off-guard by the virus, had found a convenient point of blame in the church. He said mainstream churches had a vested interest in disparaging Shincheonji, as did the “cult hunters” who demonize the church so that families hire them to remove relatives.
Shincheonji has said that  social bias against it has intensified lately, with members reporting taunting at work and death threats.
“Many church members were afraid to come out and reveal their church membership, given the overwhelming blaming coming from politicians and news media that called Shincheonji the originator of the virus outbreak,” Kim Si-mon, a church spokesman, said in a statement.
The government has repeatedly warned that the battle against the coronavirus depends on how quickly infected church members can be isolated. Mr. Lee has urged them to “follow the government’s instructions,” avoid gatherings and proselytize only online.
“I don’t even know where she lives, whether she is tested for the coronavirus, whether she is well or even alive,” the mother said.

No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.
On the first day of Europe’s first nationwide restriction on movement and public gatherings to stem the rampant spread of the coronavirus, Italians steered clear of their streets, shops, churches and soccer fields.
They obeyed the government’s “I Stay Home” decree, announced on Monday night by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte with a plea for common sacrifice to safeguard the country’s elderly population and to save the health system from collapse.
But even as Italians stayed inside, officials in the country’s north, the front line of the outbreak, pleaded for still stronger measures that would essentially shut down all commercial activity and public transportation in an effort to suffocate the contagion.
It was “time for firmness,” said Attilio Fontana, the governor of the Lombardy region, which is home to Milan and many of the most infected towns. Officials suggested the total shutdown could last for two weeks, and a spokesman for Mr. Fontana said he hoped the request would be approved by the government in Rome “as soon as possible.”
Already though, Italians had taken to their battle stations, and their couches, to fight the virus’s spread.
It was not an absolute lockdown. Although people were told to avoid leaving home, they could still move around for work, groceries and essentials (like light bulbs, the government said), and for reasons having to do with health, child or senior care.

Some older Italians said the streets had a wartime feel. Every day at 6 p.m., health and civil protection officials step out in front of national cameras and update the country on the number of infections (10,149 as of Tuesday night) and deaths (631, up 168 from the day before), a ritual that has added to the sense of calamity.
A doctor in a hospital in the Lombardy city of Bergamo posted on social media a graphic account of the stress on the health system by the overwhelming number of patients. It was republished Tuesday in Italy’s largest newspaper, Corriere della Sera.
“One after the other, these unfortunate people come to the emergency room,” he wrote. “They have far from the complications of a flu. Let’s stop saying it’s a bad flu.”
Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister, said in an interview that the virus had 10 days of a head start on the government, and that sweeping measures like the government’s decree were necessary to save all of Europe.
Luca Zaia, the governor of Veneto, which includes Venice and other cities affected by the outbreak, agreed with his political allies in Lombardy in urging stricter measures. He said that to stop the virus and save the public health system, more draconian measures, including a “total closure,” were preferable to “drawing out the agony.”
Almost alone among them, Armani, based in Milan, stayed closed to help “safeguard the health” of the public.

New Orleans Faces a Virus Nightmare, and Mardi Gras May Be Why
Louisiana may be experiencing the world’s fastest growth in new cases. Medical experts said Mardi Gras might have accelerated the crisis.
A deserted Bourbon Street in New Orleans, which has had more coronavirus cases than all but 13 states.
NEW ORLEANS — Yanti Turang, an emergency room nurse at a New Orleans hospital, walked out into the parking lot in full protective gear early this month to meet a woman with flulike symptoms who had just returned home after a layover in South Korea. The woman was immediately taken to an isolation room.
Around the same time, a man who had never left the country and had been in New Orleans throughout the just-concluded Mardi Gras season, showed up at the E.R. with a high fever and a dry cough. He was placed in a neighboring room, and cared for by hospital workers without any special gear.
To everyone’s relief, the woman who had traveled through Asia tested positive for the standard flu. The man, however, did not, Ms. Turang said. His symptoms improving but his diagnosis unclear, he was told to take Tylenol and get some rest. And he was sent back out into the city.
Ms. Turang does not know what became of that man, but he was on her mind two days later, when the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus was announced in Louisiana — another person, at another hospital. Coronavirus had been in the city all along. Since then, the outbreak here has become one of the most explosive in the country.
According to one study, Louisiana, with more than 2,300 cases as of Thursday afternoon, is experiencing the fastest growth in new cases in the world; Gov. John Bel Edwards said on Tuesday that the current trajectory of case growth in Louisiana was similar to those in Spain and Italy. This week, President Trump approved the governor’s request for a major disaster declaration, which unlocks additional federal funding to combat the outbreak.
The situation in and around New Orleans is particularly acute, with the city reporting 997 confirmed cases as of Thursday afternoon, more than the total number of cases in all but 13 states. Hospitals are overwhelmed and critical safety gear is running low.
Orleans Parish, which shares its borders with the city of New Orleans, has suffered the highest number of deaths per capita of any county in the nation. Of the parish’s 46 deaths — more than two times the death toll of Los Angeles County — 11 are from a single retirement home, where dozens more residents are infected.
In a grim irony, there is a rising suspicion among medical experts that the crisis may have been accelerated by Mardi Gras — the weekslong citywide celebration that unfolds in crowded living rooms, ballrooms and city streets — which this year culminated on Feb. 25.
“I think it all boils down to Mardi Gras,” said Dr. F. Brobson Lutz Jr., a former health director of New Orleans and a specialist in infectious disease. “The greatest free party in the world was a perfect incubator at the perfect time.”
Mardi Gras revelers on Bourbon Street on Feb. 22, weeks before Louisiana’s first confirmed coronavirus case.
The feeling is at once familiar and distinct for a city whose history is punctuated with epic disasters, including the deadly yellow fever outbreaks of 1853 and 1905, and Hurricane Katrina a century later in 2005. Once again, New Orleanians are afraid they could be neglected by national leaders, only this time because the coronavirus is a worldwide calamity.

N.Y.C. Mayor Bill de Blasio: City has one week’s worth of medical supplies
C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
As a kind of ghostliness settles over a locked-down nation, the effect of social distancing feels particularly jarring in New Orleans, a city that runs on intimacy — from the deep webs of kinship and geography that connect families and neighborhoods to the fleeting threads that bind strangers and regulars in storied restaurants and packed, sweaty clubs.
Dr. Catherine S. O’Neal, an infectious disease specialist and chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, compared this year’s Mardi Gras to the infamous 1918 “Liberty Loan” parade in Philadelphia. That gathering took place in the midst of an influenza pandemic, packed 200,000 people onto city streets and likely contributed to Philadelphia’s grisly death toll, with more than 12,000 people dying within a six-week period.
But Dr. O’Neal blamed no one for failing to take action to limit Mardi Gras festivities. At the time, no cases of the virus had been identified in Louisiana and there were fewer than 50 known cases in the United States. “We were still talking about hand washing,” she said.
Dr. Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, said there were other likely reasons, beyond Mardi Gras, that may explain why New Orleans has been hit so hard — the dense, compact nature of the city; its tourism industry; its port, which connects it to the world; and the way people connect culturally.
Ms. Turang, the emergency room nurse, who worked in Sierra Leone during the Ebola epidemic in 2015, said doctors and nurses now talk of the patients who had shown up to hospitals between Mardi Gras and the announcement of that first case on March 9, people with moderate flulike symptoms who had tested negative for the flu.

The first people to test positive in New Orleans, according to Dr. Jennifer Avegno, the city’s health director, had not recently returned from anywhere. But their array of unusual symptoms had troubled doctors.
“They just had a sense that something wasn’t right,” Dr. Avegno said. “It became clear pretty quickly that there was community spread, that the cases were not directly linked to each other.”
Mr. Edwards also limited gatherings to fewer than 50 people. But some have remained defiant, including Tony Spell, the pastor at Life Tabernacle Church outside of Baton Rouge, where, according to reports, hundreds of people have been gathering to pray without observing social distancing rules. Mr. Spell has called the virus “spiritually motivated” and said that he would heal infected members of his flock by laying hands on them and praying.
As testing ramped up, the number of cases in Louisiana surged. A medical worker at the city jail tested positive, as did a founder of the Grammy-winning Rebirth Brass Band. Sean Payton, the coach of the New Orleans Saints, announced that he had tested positive. The archbishop of New Orleans did, too.
The growth rate of new infections in Louisiana was the fastest in the world when comparing areas during the two weeks that followed their first confirmed diagnosis, according to a recent study by Gary A. Wagner, an economics professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. In a small and close city like New Orleans, that means that nearly everyone knows someone who has been infected.
“One of my members, Sister Monica, is on a ventilator,” said Tyrone Jefferson, 46, pastor of a church in the city’s St. Roch neighborhood. “Another rushed to a hospital yesterday. Two are at home with it.”
Doctors and nurses at city hospitals, like hospital workers all over the country, describe a dire shortage of critical protective gear. The Cajun Navy, one of the informal Louisiana volunteer brigades famous for rescuing people from floodwaters, and the Cajun Army have delivered several boxes of masks and gallons of hand sanitizer to medical workers.
On Tuesday, however, Mr. Edwards said he would like to see the Trump administration get more involved in the coronavirus response in a way that prioritized harder-hit areas.
Ventilators and personal protection equipment should be allocated, he said, “based upon demonstrated need, as opposed to the current situation, where every state, every health care provider, is working the best they can but independent from one another.”
As the disease spreads and sickens those fighting it, a potential shortage of medical workers, particularly nurses and respiratory therapists, is for many the biggest worry. For now, many exposed health care workers — a description that accounts for more than half of the city’s emergency medical technicians — are wearing masks and checking their temperatures but, as long as they are not showing symptoms, staying on the job.
The attendant tragedy of the pandemic — economic devastation to a city that lives on tourism and good times — has been following close behind. Most of the city’s tens of thousands of hotel and restaurant jobs do not pay enough for workers to have sufficiently saved for weeks on lockdown, but they pay better than nothing at all.
In his request for a federal emergency declaration, Governor Edwards said that projected hospitalizations would exceed the state’s capacity by April 4, and that the state had begun contracting to “build out hotels” to provide additional hospital beds. Three state parks have also been outfitted with trailers to house more than 300 patients.
If hospitals hit capacity, state officials are considering housing noncritical patients at the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, which housed thousands of residents who were forced from their homes by Katrina’s floodwaters, and became a symbol of the chaotic response to that disaster.
For now, the death toll continues its steady climb. A well-known 44-year-old D.J. who championed the city’s bounce music scene. A 53-year-old man who drove for Uber and Lyft at Mardi Gras. On Thursday, health department officials reported the death of the state’s youngest known victim, a 17-year-old in Orleans Parish.
Ellis Joseph was friends with Oliver Stokes, the D.J., and also with Ronald Lewis, a New Orleans cultural icon who died on Friday of the coronavirus, as a test would posthumously confirm. In another time, Mr. Joseph would have walked with his bass drum behind the coffin at Mr. Lewis’s funeral procession, leading a brass band in the traditional dirge “Just a Closer Walk With Thee.” Hundreds if not thousands of people would have followed or lined the streets.

The vice president tested negative for the coronavirus.
Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, tested negative for the coronavirus, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pence said Saturday night.
The White House first disclosed the employee’s illness on Friday evening. Mr. Pence’s spokeswoman, Katie Miller, said in a statement that “further contact tracing is being conducted in accordance with C.D.C. guidelines,” but she did not immediately reply to a request for more details about the official’s role.
Several former and current Trump administration officials have self-quarantined over concerns of exposure to the virus. Those include Mick Mulvaney, the former acting White House chief of staff, and Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary.
Last week, Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, stayed home “out of an abundance of caution” after an Australian official she recently met with tested positive for the coronavirus, a White House spokesman said. By Friday, she had returned to work, watching from the sidelines as her father sparred with reporters in the briefing room.
A person familiar with the situation said she had tested negative for the virus.
As urgency for medical supplies builds, the White House says companies are stepping up to help.
The White House signaled Saturday that American companies were increasing efforts to restock hospitals with crucial supplies during the coronavirus pandemic, but it again stopped short of more assertive steps that some state and local leaders have been demanding.
At a news conference on Saturday at the White House, Vice President Mike Pence said the federal government had ordered “hundreds of millions” of N-95 masks for health care facilities across the country, but he did not say precisely when they would be delivered to workers. And President Trump said another company, Hanes, was now on the roster of major corporations coordinating with the administration.
‘We’re Working Quickly,’ Trump Says About Coronavirus Relief Efforts
President Trump discussed his approval of a major disaster declaration for the State of New York, attempts to address medical supply shortages and other developments in the pandemic.
Other companies the administration announced coordination with include Honeywell and 3M. Mr. Trump also said Pernod Ricard USA had repurposed production facilities in four states to manufacture hand sanitizer, with the first delivery expected on Tuesday. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said on Saturday that the company would donate millions of masks to health professionals fighting the virus in the U.S. and Europe.
In the United States, entities as diverse as Christian Siriano, a fashion designer favored by former first lady Michelle Obama, Dov Charney, the founder of Los Angeles Apparel and the former chief executive of American Apparel, and Karla Colletto, a swimwear company, all said this weekend they had begun to repurpose their operations to create masks and hospital garments.
In Europe, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury goods company, announced on Saturday it had ordered 40 million face masks from a Chinese supplier. They are bound for France. L’Oreal and Coty, the beauty conglomerates, announced they would use their facilities to produce large quantities of hand sanitizer for European hospitals.
Separately, the Food and Drug Administration announced on Saturday that it would permit a Silicon Valley company, Cepheid, to start selling a diagnostic test that could determine in about 45 minutes whether a patient has the virus that causes Covid-19.
The company’s chief medical officer, David Persing, said the tests would be compatible with systems it already had in place at thousands of hospitals and clinics, and that they were likely to hit the market late next week. He did not say how many would be available or how much they would cost.
Hawaii’s governor ordered a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the state.
Gov. David Ige of Hawaii, seeking to slow the increase of coronavirus cases in his state, on Saturday ordered a mandatory 14-day quarantine for everyone arriving in Hawaii, including both tourists and returning residents. He said his order was the first of its kind in the nation.

C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
“The threat of Covid-19 is extremely serious, and it requires extreme actions,” he said in a news conference.
Under Mr. Ige’s emergency proclamation, returning residents are to quarantine in their homes, with visitors to stay in their hotel rooms or rented lodgings. They are to leave only to seek medical care.
The Hawaii Department of Health on Saturday reported 48 cases of coronavirus in the state, an increase of 11 from the day before. A majority of the state’s cases are linked to travel, according to Mr. Ige.
“We know that our economy will suffer from this action,” he said. But it is necessary, he added, to “flatten the curve” so that the state’s health care system is not overwhelmed.
A Washington State hospital warned that it could run out of ventilators by early April.
Dr. Marty Brueggemann, the chief medical officer at Virginia Mason Memorial in Yakima, Wash., warned Saturday that the hospital could run out of life-preserving ventilators by April 8 if the case projections don’t improve and the hospital isn’t able to acquire other machines.
Dr. Brueggemann said he’s witnessed a jarring juxtaposition of what’s going on inside the hospital, which is controlling visitors and preparing for an onslaught of patients, only to leave the facility and find people out in the community gathered in large groups, making clear to him that the general population doesn’t grasp the gravity of the situation.
Washington’s Department of Health has told local leaders that only the highest-priority areas will have access to the government’s stockpile of protective equipment, including N95 masks.
Long-term care facilities with confirmed infections and hospitals with the largest number of confirmed cases are at the top of the list, while sites lower down include homeless shelters or medical facilities that don’t have confirmed cases. The agency cautioned that not all requests will be fulfilled, and leaders at places like neighborhood health clinics have already seen weeks pass without requests being approved.

Efforts are being made to suppress the outbreak and expand medical capacity. But if forced to ration, medical workers ask, how do they make the least terrible decision? Who even gets to decide, and how are their choices justified?
In the United States, some guidelines already exist for this grim task. In an effort little known even among doctors, federal grant programs helped hospitals, states and the Veterans Health Administration develop what are essentially rationing plans for a severe pandemic. Now those plans, some of which may be outdated, are being revisited for the coronavirus outbreak.
Even if the United States cuts its rate of transmission in half — a tall order — some 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months.

That was the conclusion of Columbia University researchers who used a New York Times database of known cases and Census Bureau transportation data to model how the outbreak could evolve. The estimates are inherently uncertain, and they could change as the United States adopts additional measures to control the outbreak.
After a day of negotiations over an economic stabilization package, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, asked top Republican negotiators to “draft final legislative text that reflects their compromise products” and deliver it later in the evening. His goal, he said in a statement Saturday night, is to ensure senators could review it before a procedural vote Sunday that would allow the relief for American families and businesses impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.
Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak
The virus has infected more than 671,600 people in at least 171 countries.
Italy has imposed a lockdown, deployed the army and risked its economy to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Yet Italy’s toll is growing more staggering by the day: On Saturday, officials reported 793 additional deaths, by far the largest single-day increase so far. Italy has surpassed China as the country with the highest death toll, becoming the epicenter of a shifting global pandemic.

The government is expected to publish an emergency decree on Sunday to make the latest crackdown immediately effective.
The virus’s effects are being felt throughout Europe. Poland has reported fewer than 500 cases, but one of the country’s hospitals was shut down and evacuated on Saturday after 30 patients and staff members were found to have the virus. France, one of the hardest hit countries in Europe, raised its totals to 14,459 confirmed cases and 562 deaths, and said it had ordered over 250 million face masks from French and foreign suppliers.
The governor of the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg asked hospitals in his state to estimate capacity in their intensive care units, so that French patients in need of respirators from the heavily hit Alsace region can be transferred for treatment.
The German authorities banned people in Berlin from meeting in groups of more than 10 people, with the exception of lawmakers, courts and those providing essential services, and Spain’s health ministry reported a surge in the number of coronavirus deaths to 1,326 and total cases to 25,000, a rise of about 25 percent from a day earlier.
In the Madrid region, which has had 60 percent of Spain’s cases, hospitals are overflowing and facing equipment shortages. Officials ordered that a field hospital with about 5,500 beds be set up in the Spanish capital’s main exhibition center. In the Valencia region, three field hospitals have been added, with a combined 1,000 beds. Hotels have also been converted into hospitals in Madrid and Catalonia, where 122 people have died.
But Italy’s struggle is among the world’s most pronounced, and it is increasingly being seen as a tragic warning for other countries to heed, in part because it is still paying the price of  early mixed messages by scientists and politicians. The people who have died in staggering numbers recently — more than 2,300 in the last four days — were mostly infected during the confusion of a week or two ago.
Trump wrote to Kim Jong-un offering North Korea help in its coronavirus fight.
President Trump sent a letter to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, expressing his willingness to help the North battle the coronavirus, and North Korea responded by expressing gratitude.
According to Ms. Kim, Mr. Trump also explained his plan to move relations between the two countries forward and “expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work, saying that he was impressed by the efforts made by the Chairman to defend his people from the serious threat of the epidemic.”
The Trump administration has said the policy is necessary to combat a potential outbreak of the coronavirus in border facilities.
It remains unclear whether the directive from the top health officials in the United States would prevent every migrant from having an opportunity to claim asylum. Immigration lawyers have said the rule potentially violates laws that say the United States must provide a migrant on American soil the opportunity to ask for protections and not force migrants to return to places where they would face persecution.
‘Everything Is Uncharted’: New Yorkers Confront Life Amid a Coronavirus Shutdown
With restrictions tightened on businesses and daily activity, residents are grappling with uncertainty about resources, health care and their paychecks.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a Major Disaster Declaration for New York, meaning billions of dollars in federal aid could be coming to New York as the rising number of coronavirus cases shows no sign of abating.
As of Saturday, 10,356 New York state residents had tested positive for the virus. With 6 percent of the U.S. population, the state now accounts for nearly half of the cases in the country tallied by The New York Times.
On Friday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that one million N-95 protective masks were being sent to hospitals in New York City and another 500,000 to Long Island. The state had also identified about 6,000 ventilators from “places all across the globe” for purchase, the governor said.
With coronavirus threatening to overwhelm New York hospitals, state officials are considering turning landmark locations like the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into makeshift hospitals.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also looking at other locations, including two at State University of New York campuses on Long Island, and at the Westchester Convention Center. The Army Corps is expected to outfit the centers with hospital equipment as soon as Mr. Cuomo tours and green lights the locations, officials said.
For more than a week, the 315 passengers aboard the Silver Shadow cruise liner were stuck in their cabins in Recife, Brazil, after a Canadian passenger fell ill and ultimately tested positive for the coronavirus.
Feeling anxious about the coronavirus is understandable, but a little respite is also important. Try hosting a remote happy hour, for instance, or learning a new song — one you can sing while washing your hands.

In Egypt, Tourists Torn Between Ancient Temples and Coronavirus Tests
Egyptian officials insist that it’s safe to visit. But on Monday, tourists in the ancient city of Luxor were confined to their hotels as doctors tested for the virus.
CAIRO — When tourists in Luxor woke up on Monday to find themselves confined to their hotels or cruise ships on the Nile, it seemed that Egypt was taking extreme measures to confront the coronavirus in the ancient town at the heart of its tourism industry.
The contradictory and often chaotic approach in Luxor reflects a major dilemma facing Egyptian officials: Can the government continue to welcome cash-carrying visitors at the same time it tries to battle a looming public health crisis in the jewel of its tourism industry?
Luxor, home to the iconic Valley of the Kings and King Tutankhamen’s tomb, is now the center of the country’s coronavirus outbreak. On Friday and Saturday, 45 passengers and crew members aboard a riverboat, the A Sara, tested positive for the virus and were taken by military air transport to an isolation unit at a hospital on Egypt’s north coast.
With the outbreak unfolding, Egypt’s tourism minister visited one of Luxor’s temples on Sunday to declare that it was safe and open to visitors.
Beside him, Egypt’s health minister, Hala Zayed, warned people not to “exaggerate” about the scale of the crisis. “We will get through this together,” she said

But even as they spoke, the cruise boat at the center of the outbreak was docked at a nearby riverbank — with 136 people quarantined on board — stoking fears that Egypt could be on the verge of a major problem.
The sense of urgency heightened on Sunday night, when a 60-year-old German tourist died at a hospital in the Red Sea resort Hurghada — Egypt’s first fatality. The tourist had come from Luxor.
The contrasting scenes in Luxor in recent days illustrated the country’s precarious balancing act in the face of the outbreak: Even as doctors administered tests on Monday, they did not want to get in the way of anyone’s vacation.
Yara Ahmed, an Egyptian journalist at a film festival in Luxor, said that of the 400 people at her hotel, only 10 were tested. And once those tests were administered, everyone was allowed to leave immediately — even the people who had been tested.

At best, such a testing strategy would indicate if the coronavirus has spread from the infected ship onto Egypt’s shore, said Dr. Cyrus Shahpar of Vital Strategies, a global public health organization.
“But it’s not a containment strategy, because you’re not containing anyone,” he said.
Until Friday, Egypt had just three declared coronavirus cases, one of the lowest rates in the Middle East. On Monday night, it said it had 59 cases, most on the ship in Luxor, and there is deep uncertainty about how widely the virus has spread into a country of 100 million people.
But already, Luxor has become a hub for transmitting the coronavirus to other countries.
In the past week or so, at least 29 tourists who visited Egypt in February tested positive after returning home. The infected tourists are mostly American and French, and several of them traveled on the A Sara, the Nile cruiser now quarantined at Luxor.
The World Health Organization says that the virus came to the boat via a Taiwanese-American woman who left Egypt on Feb. 1. Egypt says it did not learn of her infection until March 1, and the first infected crew members were discovered on the A Sara on March 6.
This time, officials insist they are being transparent. The health ministry says that it has conducted 2,166 tests and that it is working closely with the World Health Organization to track down anyone who has come in contact with an infected person.
One reason populous countries like Egypt and Indonesia may have low virus rates so far, Dr. Shahpar said, is because they lack the resources or health care systems to test on the scale of nations like South Korea or Italy.
Now the coronavirus is posing a new threat. A tour operator on the Nile said several of his customers had quit their river tours on Monday and were flying home. Other companies in Luxor have canceled their tours entirely.
In Luxor, the virus has sowed fear among workers in the tourism industry. State-run media outlets have reported that some cruise workers quit their jobs in recent days, fearing they might get ill.

The virus has infected more than 672,500 people in at least 171 countries.
President Trump announced on Monday that he would work with Congress on measures to bolster the economy following the steepest market drop in more than a decade, fueled by fear over the coronavirus outbreak.
Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that he would meet with Senate leaders and House Republicans on Tuesday to discuss a “very substantial” payroll tax cut and legislation intended to protect hourly wage earners who may have to miss work because of the virus. He also said he would ensure that the Small Business Administration extends more loans.
At the same news briefing, Vice President Mike Pence said that more than a million coronavirus tests have been distributed, and that another four million tests would be distributed by the end of the week.
Neither Mr. Pence nor Mr. Trump has been tested. The president’s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said on Tuesday night that Mr. Trump would not be tested “because he has neither had prolonged close contact” with confirmed patients “nor does he have any symptoms.”
Asian markets opened mixed on Tuesday, in an apparent sign that investors were trying to regain their footing one day after the worst financial rout in years. Stocks in the United States had suffered their worst single-day decline in more than a decade on Monday, as the coronavirus and an oil price war fueled concerns about the global economy.

At the Seattle-area nursing home linked to 19 deaths, 31 more residents have tested positive.
Test results have come back on 35 more residents of a locked-down nursing home in the Seattle suburbs that is already linked to 19 coronavirus deaths, and nearly all of them are infected, officials said on Monday.
Tim Killian, a spokesman for the home, Life Care Center of Kirkland, said 31 out of 35 residents tested positive but none of them had symptoms serious enough to require hospitalization. He said test results were still pending on 20 more residents.
Vanessa Phelps said she got a phone call from Life Care late on Monday afternoon telling her that her 90-year-old mother, Fiona, had tested positive for the coronavirus.
Her mother has severe chronic lung disease, Ms. Phelps said. “She needs to get out of there and be in a hospital,” Ms. Phelps said. “She has the disease. She has the virus.”
Residents have been pleading for days to be tested. Mr. Killian said on Saturday that the facility had received enough test kits to check all its residents, but not all its employees, dozens of whom are showing symptoms of illness.
In addition to the 19 known coronavirus deaths, at least one other resident connected to the home had already tested positive before Monday. There have been 11 more deaths at the home since Feb. 19, for which the facility has no post-mortem test results.
A cruise ship isolated off the coast of California amid a coronavirus outbreak has docked at the Port of Oakland, and officials are preparing to quarantine the thousands of people who have been stranded on board.
State and federal agencies had been putting together a detailed plan for how to contain coronavirus cases from the vessel, which is carrying 2,421 passengers and 1,113 crew members. Last week, 45 people on the ship were tested for coronavirus and 21 tested positive, 19 of them crew members.
It is expected to take two to three days to clear the ship, with priority given to the patients who tested positive and other people who need medical care.
S.E.C. advises employees in Washington to work from home.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, in response to a potential coronavirus case, on Monday required a part of its staff to stay away from the agency’s Washington headquarters and advised all other employees there to work from home as well, a person briefed on the matter said. The move was reported earlier by The Washington Post.

An email that the agency sent to workers said the requirement applied to those on the ninth floor of the headquarters, the person confirmed. The email said a doctor had told an S.E.C. employee with respiratory symptoms earlier that they could be because of the coronavirus.
Federal health officials are urging older Americans and their families to take a host of precautions against infection.
In addition to the basics recommended for everyone like washing hands often, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on Monday that people over 80 should:
Have a backup plan for health care if they are homebound;
Older adults with additional health conditions are far more likely to become severely ill or die from a coronavirus infection than younger people are. According to a study of more than 72,000 patients in China, the death rate was less than 1 percent of those under 50, but rose to 8 percent for those in their 70s and 15 percent for those in their 80s.
The virus continues to spread across the U.S.
The United States faces an accelerating pace of new coronavirus case reports as well as the prospect of more sweeping measures to fight the spread of the virus. On Monday, the national total of infections surpassed 700 and the death toll hit 26; it was the seventh consecutive day with more diagnoses than the previous day.
In Kentucky, a patient who tested positive had worked at a Walmart in Cynthiana, near Lexington, officials said. In Washington, D.C., a church rector who gave communion and shook hands with parishioners at Christ Church Georgetown was identified as a patient, prompting officials to urge hundreds of parishioners to self-quarantine. The church organist later tested positive, a church spokesman said Monday night.
Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said he was considering mandatory measures to keep people apart. School districts in several states have shut down, universities are moving classes online, companies are telling employees to work from home, and houses of worship are limiting services.
The Army announced on Monday that the commander of U.S. forces in Europe, Lt. Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, along with several members of his staff, had been exposed to the coronavirus and would self-quarantine as they wait to see if they develop symptoms.
“I don’t think you want to have folks shutting down cities like in northern Italy — we are not at that level,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the leading American expert on infectious diseases, said in an interview. “Social distancing like in Seattle is the way to go.”
The coronavirus outbreak has prompted the cancellation of one of Boston’s iconic events: the city’s St. Patrick’s Day parade.
“This decision is being made out of an abundance of caution, to ensure that we are doing what is needed to keep the residents of Boston safe and healthy,” Mayor Martin J. Walsh said on Monday.
Twenty-eight coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Massachusetts, and another 22 cases across the country have been traced to a recent business conference in Boston.
Two Republican lawmakers who were recently with Trump will self-quarantine.
Four congressional Republicans, including two who were recently with President Trump, have said they would self-quarantine for two weeks after coming into contact with an attendee of a conservative conference who has tested positive for the coronavirus.
Representatives Matt Gaetz of Florida and Doug Collins of Georgia said on Monday that they had interacted, at the Conservative Political Action Conference, with a person who had tested positive for the virus and would isolate themselves voluntarily. Also putting himself into isolation was Mark Meadows, the president’s newly designated White House chief of staff, who tested negative for the coronavirus after coming into contact with the same person.
The president’s spokeswoman said Mr. Trump would not be tested because he had no symptoms and no prolonged close contact with confirmed patients.
Two other Republicans, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona, said on Sunday they would self-quarantine after coming into contact with the same conference attendee.
[Update: Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, wife of Canada’s leader, tests positive for coronavirus.]
Mr. Gaetz boarded Air Force One with Mr. Trump on Monday before announcing that he had been tested. A flamboyant ally of the president, he turned heads last week when he wore a gas mask on the House floor before a vote on an emergency virus-related spending bill.
Mr. Collins interacted directly with Mr. Trump on Friday, shaking the president’s hand and standing directly behind him as he toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
New York has 142 confirmed cases, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday, and one of them is the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Rick Cotton.
In New Jersey, where 11 cases have been confirmed, Gov. Philip D. Murphy declared a state of emergency and a public health emergency on Monday, effective immediately.
Mr. Cotton is one of the most prominent public officials in the United States to have contracted the virus. The agency he leads operates the metropolitan area’s three major airports, as well as numerous other transportation facilities including bridges and tunnels, bus terminals and seaports.
The number of infections in Europe continued to surge at an alarming pace, more than doubling in three days to more than 14,000 confirmed by Monday, with more than 520 deaths.
Italy, with 9,172 cases and 463 deaths by Monday, surpassed South Korea over the weekend to become the country with the second-largest outbreak, after China.
Germany, France and Spain each have well over 1,000 cases, and France’s culture minister, Franck Rister, announced that he had tested positive for the virus. Switzerland, the Netherlands, Britain, Sweden, Belgium and Norway each have more than 200.
Germany’s status as the only country with a large outbreak but no fatalities came to an end, with its first two coronavirus deaths.
Saudi Arabia shut off air and sea travel to nine countries in an effort to slow transmission of the virus as the kingdom grappled with a simultaneous blow to its economy from a severe plunge in oil prices.
The virus outbreak is presenting challenges during the U.S. election season.
Washington State, the state hardest hit by the virus, is holding its 2020 primary on Tuesday. It votes by mail, which eliminates most concerns about viral transmission.
Public health officials have said adults over 60 are most at risk and should avoid crowds. Joseph R. Biden Jr. is 77, Bernie Sanders is 78 and Mr. Trump is 73.
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.

The Coronavirus Outbreak
Coronavirus May Have Spread in U.S. for Weeks, Gene Sequencing Suggests
Two cases detected weeks apart in Washington State had genetic links, suggesting that many more people in the area may be infected.
The first death in the United States from the coronavirus outbreak occurred at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland, Wash. on Saturday.
Researchers who have examined the genomes of two coronavirus infections in Washington State say the similarities between the cases suggest that the virus may have been spreading in the state for weeks.
Washington had the United States’ first confirmed case of coronavirus, announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Jan. 20. Based on an analysis of the virus’s genetic sequence, another case that surfaced in the state and was announced on Friday probably was descended from that first case.
The two people live in the same county, but are not known to have had contact with one another, and the second case occurred well after the first would no longer be expected to be contagious. So the genetic findings suggest that the virus has been spreading through other people in the community for close to six weeks, according to one of the scientists who compared the sequences, Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington.
Dr. Bedford said it was possible that the two cases could be unrelated, and had been introduced separately into the United States. But he said that was unlikely, however, because in both cases the virus contained a genetic variation that appears to be rare — it was found in only two of the 59 samples whose sequences have been shared from China, where the virus originated.
A scientist who was not involved in the analysis said he agreed with the conclusion that the second case was connected to the original Washington case. “I think he’s right,” said Andrew Rambaut, professor of molecular evolution at the University of Edinburgh, referring to Dr. Bedford. “It’s extremely unlikely that two viruses coming from outside the U.S.A. independently would arrive in the same geographical area and be genetically related unless they were connected.”
State and local health officials have been hamstrung in their ability to test widely for the coronavirus. Until very recently, the C.D.C. had insisted that only its test could be used, and only on patients who met specific criteria — those who had traveled to China within 14 days of developing symptoms or had contact with a known coronavirus case.
If the virus has been spreading undetected in Washington since mid-January, that could mean that anywhere from 150 to 1,500 people may have it, with about 300 to 500 people the most likely range, said Dr. Mike Famulare, a principal research scientist at the Institute for Disease Modeling in Bellevue, Wa., who performed the analysis. These people “have either been infected and recovered, or currently are infected now,” he said.
Latest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak
C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
Many of those people would now be in the early stages of incubating the virus, and might not yet be contagious, Dr. Famulare said.
Dr. Famulare’s estimate was based on a simulation using what scientists have learned about the incubation period and transmissibility of the virus. He called his figures a “best guess, with broad uncertainty.” Another method, based on the size of the local population, the number of tests performed and the proportion of those that were positive, produced similar estimates of how widely the virus may have spread in the community.
The scientists immediately reported the genomic sequence and their findings to state and federal health officials.
Dr. Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for communicable diseases with the Washington State Department of Health, said on Sunday that though Dr. Bedford’s laboratory had “very limited” data to work with, “I would not be surprised if there was transmission and these two were related.”
Heather Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Snohomish Health District, said in a statement that the district was aware of the preliminary findings suggesting that coronavirus had been spreading for close to six weeks.
Sign up to receive our daily Coronavirus Briefing, an informed guide with the latest developments and expert advice.
She said that it was important to remember that national testing capabilities have only been available for about six weeks, and in Washington, health personnel have only had the ability to test locally for a few days. “It is definitely possible that Covid-19 has been circulating, with people experiencing mild symptoms just like the flu,’’ she said.
The first patient, a man in his 30s, has recovered after being treated in a hospital isolation unit. The later patient, a teenager, had a mild enough illness to recuperate at home.
According to a statement by the Snohomish Health District, the teenager was unaware that he was being tested for the coronavirus. His case came to light on Friday because he went to a clinic on Feb. 24 to be tested for the flu, and his sample was shared with the Seattle Flu Study, which tested it for a variety of pathogens including the new coronavirus.
Tests have been performed on about 1,000 samples from the study, Dr. Lindquist said, with only one positive result thus far. “So it’s not like it’s super prevalent,” he said of the virus.
Similar analyses have helped public health officials trace cases and fight outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
On Saturday, local health officials in Seattle said that delays in being able to test for the virus had slowed identification of community cases, meaning those who did not travel to places with major outbreaks or have contact with known patients. “If we had the ability to test earlier, I’m sure we would have been able to identify patients earlier,” said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County.
Two more confirmed cases in the state were announced on Sunday.
The genomic technique used to compare the viruses is akin to constructing a family tree. “As a virus passes from person to person, there will be errors that occur” as copies of the virus are made, Dr. Bedford said. To explain, he compared the tiny mutations in the genetic sequence to mistakes made during a game of telephone. “Those can link up,” he said.
The first case had one genetic difference from the original virus that was detected in Wuhan. The new case had that mutation, plus three additional ones. More than 125 genomes derived from samples taken from coronavirus patients around the world have been shared among scientists thus far, providing data for the analysis.
In the first case in Washington, the man in his 30s had been traveling in Wuhan, China, and returned home to Snohomish County, Wash., on Jan. 15. He sought medical care a few days later after developing symptoms and suspecting that he might have the coronavirus, officials have said, and tests later came back positive.
Health officials then scrambled to retrace his history, tracking down eight people he had socialized with at a group lunch and 37 more who were in the clinic when he showed up for medical help. They also reached out to people on his flight back to the United States.
But as the man remained in hospital isolation, and then later returned home, officials reported no new cases in Washington state. They tested two dozen people over a span of five weeks, and all came back negative.
That changed this week, when the state laboratory became able to test for the virus. Officials reported two new confirmed cases Friday night, and then more, including the first patient to die of the virus in the United States. They are now working to trace how the cases in the state might be linked, and who else might have been exposed.
Two cases have been detected at a skilled nursing facility in Kirkland, Wash., where officials said dozens of other people also had symptoms that could be a sign of coronavirus infection but could also be symptoms of flu.
Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington has declared a state of emergency, and said officials may need to take steps like canceling sporting events and closing schools to slow the spread of the virus in the community.

Second Death From Virus Is Reported in the U.S.
The second death was a man in his 70s in the Seattle area who had underlying health conditions.
This briefing has ended. Read live updates on the coronavirus here.
EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland, Wash., on Saturday.
Second coronavirus death reported in the U.S.
A second person has died of the novel coronavirus in the Seattle area and more confirmed cases of the illness have emerged in Washington State, officials said Sunday evening. Public health leaders in King County, Wash., said a man in his 70s with underlying health conditions died on Saturday at EvergreenHealth hospital in Kirkland. That’s the same facility where officials identified the nation’s first coronavirus death on Saturday — a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions.
Officials also announced three other confirmed coronavirus cases in the county, all at EvergreenHealth. They include a woman in her 80s, a woman in her 90s and a man in his 70s. All were in critical condition with underlying health issues. All four new cases were residents of a nursing facility in Kirkland where two other people — a resident and a worker — had previously tested positive.
Also on Sunday, the county had previously reported two other patients, unrelated to the nursing facility, who were in critical condition at hospitals in Renton and Seattle.
As of Sunday night, 88 cases of coronavirus had been identified in the United States.
The first of those cases was announced on Jan. 21, but this weekend saw a marked uptick in the pace of diagnoses. Twenty-three U.S. cases were announced on Saturday and Sunday, including the country’s first two deaths, both in Washington State.
The cases identified over the weekend were in Washington, California, Illinois, Rhode Island, New York, Florida and Oregon, and included a mix of people who had traveled to high-risk countries and those who were believed to have contracted the disease domestically.
Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak
The virus has infected more than 671,600 people in at least 171 countries.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Sunday confirmed New York State’s first case of the coronavirus, saying that a woman contracted the virus while traveling in Iran and is now in New York isolated in her home.
“The patient has respiratory symptoms, but is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving to New York,” Governor Cuomo said in a statement, offering no details on the woman’s whereabouts.
No cases are currently outstanding. New York’s state lab was granted the ability to test for the novel coronavirus on Saturday after an appeal from Governor Cuomo.
Florida declares a public health emergency.
Two cases of the virus were identified in Florida late Sunday night, prompting the state to declare a public health emergency.
The Florida Health Department said in a statement that the Manatee County patient is an adult without a travel history to the countries restricted by the C.D.C. The Hillsborough County patient had traveled to Italy. Both patients are in isolation.
Two health care workers in California test positive, adding to a growing U.S. total.
Two health care workers in the San Francisco Bay Area tested positive for the coronavirus after they were exposed to a patient now being treated for the virus at a hospital in Sacramento, the authorities said on Sunday.
The workers’ conditions were not immediately available, but public health officials in Alameda County and Solano County said in a news release that the workers were isolated in their homes.
The news came after new cases were reported in both Washington State and Rhode Island. Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the government planned a “radical expansion” in testing capacity.
Globally, the number of infections has risen to more than 88,000. China reported an additional 202 infections and 42 deaths from the virus, bringing its total number of confirmed infections to more than 80,000 and total of deaths from the virus to exceed 3,000.

In Washington, two new patients in King County, both men in their 60s, were in critical condition, officials said. The state became the site of the country’s first coronavirus death on Saturday.
Latest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak
C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
Washington State has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, and researchers who studied two cases there say that the virus may have been spreading for weeks, with the possibility that up to 1,500 people may have been infected.
Health officials in Rhode Island announced Sunday that a second person in that state tested positive for coronavirus after returning from a school trip to Europe.
That person, a teenager, had minor symptoms. Officials had earlier announce  that an adult who went on the trip tested positive. Eighty-eight cases of coronavirus had been identified in the United States as of Sunday night, including 23 announced over the weekend.
Which is worse, coronavirus or flu?
The coronavirus and the flu are often compared these days. But what are their basic similarities and differences?
So far, the coronavirus seems to be deadlier. On average, the seasonal flu strain kills about 0.1 percent of people who become infected. Early estimates of the death rate in the coronavirus outbreak’s epicenter in Wuhan, China, have been around 2 percent.
As with influenza, the coronavirus is most dangerous to people over the age of 65, or who have chronic illness or a weak immune system.
[Read: ‘No way out’: In China, coronavirus takes a toll on other patients.]
And so far, the flu has sickened more people than the coronavirus. In the United States, there have been 32 million cases of flu, several hundred thousands hospitalizations and 18,000 deaths, according to the C.D.C. By contrast, about 88 people in the United States have been infected with the new coronavirus, and there have been two deaths.
One area where the two ailments diverge is treatment. There is no approved antiviral drug for the coronavirus, but several are being tested. For those infected with any viral illness, doctors recommend rest, medicine to reduce pain and fever, and fluids to avoid dehydration. For the flu, doctors can offer four prescription medicines and they tend to work best within a day or two of when symptoms start.
There are no coronavirus vaccinations available, but one may be available in a year or two. Flu vaccines are widely available and generally 40 percent to 60 percent effective.
Amazon says 2 employees infected, as tech companies introduce new restrictions worldwide.

Other tech firms are also working to secure their offices while minimizing the potential for the spread of the virus. Facebook has advised employees to reach out if they feel ill and to feel free to work from home, according to two company employees familiar with the company’s plans. Over the weekend, the company also said in an internal memo that it would no longer allow social visits from non-employees at any of its global offices.
The coronavirus continued to spread around the world on Sunday.
Ecuador’s health ministry said it had six confirmed cases of coronavirus, with one person in critical condition. All are part of the same family, the authorities said. The five noncritical patients were in home isolation “as a protective measure” and under observation, Catalina Andramuño Zeballos, the country’s health minister, said in a news conference.
“We have to be prepared for the possibility of a significant outbreak of coronavirus in the weeks to come,” Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said in an interview with Sky News.
In the Dominican Republic, a 62-year-old man — a tourist visiting the country from Italy — tested positive and was in stable condition, the country’s health minister, Rafael Sanchez, said at a news conference. Another tourist, a 56-year-old man from France, is under observation at a hospital and awaiting test results for coronavirus.
Louvre closes for coronavirus meeting as cases rise in Europe.
Long lines of visitors were locked out of the Louvre in Paris on Sunday after the museum, the world’s most visited, said it was holding a staff meeting about the coronavirus outbreak.
The Louvre said on Twitter that “the museum cannot open at the moment” because of an informational meeting on the public health situation linked to coronavirus prevention measures.
The move came as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continued to rise in Europe.
Italy, the center of the outbreak on the continent, has a total of 1,694 confirmed cases and 34 deaths. France has reported 100 cases and two deaths. And Germany said on Sunday that cases there had risen to 117, including 66 in North Rhine-Westphalia, its most populous state.
Ireland reported its first case, the country’s Health Protection Surveillance Center said on Twitter on Sunday, while in neighboring Britain officials said that the number of cases there had risen to 35. A school in Reading, in southeastern England, said on Saturday that a staff member had tested positive, forcing the school to “shut for some days to allow for a deep clean,” the school’s head teacher said in a message to the pupils’ parents.
In Norway, two more staff members at Oslo University Hospital tested positive for the virus, a hospital spokesman said on Sunday, raising the total number of cases in the country to 17, while Sweden has confirmed its 13th case.
Flights are suspended amid an outbreak in Italy.  
The uptick in coronavirus cases in Italy has already prompted new local safety measures and mass tourist cancellations, leaving the usually dynamic city of Milan eerily deserted.
This weekend, the impact of the outbreak stretched even further.
Delta Air Lines said it would suspend daily flights between New York and Milan, becoming yet another travel business to alter its operations in light of the outbreak in Italy. On Saturday American Airlines said it would suspend flights to Milan from New York and Miami, citing a “reduction in demand.”
The airlines’ suspensions came as President Trump on Saturday announced elevated restrictions on foreign travel to the parts of Italy most affected by the virus.
Seoul seeks a murder inquiry into leaders of a church linked to the outbreak.
Officials from the city of Seoul, South Korea, on Sunday asked prosecutors to investigate the founder of a church at the center of the country’s coronavirus outbreak and other top leaders of the sect on murder and other criminal charges.
[Read: He blames ‘evil’ for South Korea’s coronavirus surge. Officials blame him.]
Officials believe that the church has contributed to the country’s rising death toll from the virus — which reached 18 as of Sunday — by failing to provide disease-control officials with an accurate list of church members and by interfering with the government’s efforts to fight the outbreak.
Officials say that nearly 60 percent of the 4,212 confirmed cases in South Korea are in members of Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southeastern city of Daegu or people who came into contact with them.
South Korean officials also said on Sunday that some church members had visited the Chinese city of Wuhan in January. The global outbreak is believed to have begun in a seafood and poultry market in Wuhan.
Officials in South Korea have been trying to figure out how the virus reached the congregation. The church has acknowledged having members in Wuhan, but it said none of them had visited South Korea since December.
A Japanese official said on Sunday that all of the passengers and crew members from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who spent more than two weeks quarantined onboard had been cleared of the coronavirus, but a man who was a passenger on the ship has become the first in Australia to die of the virus.
The cruise ship, on which hundreds of Americans were passengers, represents the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China, with several hundred infections.
Japan’s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said in a press briefing on Sunday that 238 crew members would be quarantined for 14 days at a government facility in Saitama Prefecture outside Tokyo.
The ministry says that 149 crew members contracted the virus onboard the ship. Hundreds of other crew members have been evacuated to their home countries.
The health minister also confirmed that an eighth public official who worked onboard the cruise ship during the quarantine had tested positive on Friday.
Iran, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East, said on Sunday that 385 new cases had been detected in the country this weekend, raising its total number of officially confirmed cases to 987, state news media reported.
An Iranian health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpur, said on Sunday that the country’s death toll from the virus had risen to 54, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
Iran has temporarily closed schools and universities and canceled public events like concerts in an effort to curtail the virus’s spread. But secrecy and confusion over the outbreak in the country have fueled suspicions that its number of cases is far higher than officially acknowledged.
Democratic candidates use the coronavirus to attack President Trump on the economy.
But after the effects of the coronavirus dealt stock markets their worst week since 2008, Democratic presidential candidates opened a new line of attack. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York have revamped their stump speeches to portray themselves as the type of president the United States needs to endure a potential economic and public health crisis.
Mr. Bloomberg will deliver a three-minute recorded address on the coronavirus outbreak in an ad on network television Sunday night, according to his presidential campaign.
China’s initial response to the coronavirus epidemic was marred by policy stumbles that fueled public anger, the nation’s leader, Xi Jinping, said in published speech excerpts that laid out his ideas for strengthening the country’s defenses against such outbreaks.
Mr. Xi’s comments, drawn from two internal speeches that he made in February, were published on Saturday in Qiushi, or “Seeking Truth,” the ruling Communist Party’s leading journal. They seemed intended to highlight the policy and legal changes that Mr. Xi intends to push to confront the epidemic.
Those include banning the trade in wildlife that scientists believe may have let the coronavirus jump from animals into the human population; more effective monitoring of potential epidemics; and stronger coordination to direct emergency medical supplies when an outbreak happens.
While praising the Chinese government’s response to the crisis, Mr. Xi also acknowledged problems, using blunter language than he had in previous public comments on the epidemic.
“Some localities and departments were at a loss in how to react to this sudden epidemic,” Mr. Xi said. “Some protective measures went through abrupt changes, and in some areas there was even lawless and criminal conduct that seriously impeded containing the epidemic, and there was public dissatisfaction about this.”

Teenager’s Death in California Is Linked to Coronavirus
The victim would be one of the youngest in the United States. “Covid-19 does not discriminate by age, race or income level,” the Los Angeles County health department said.
People visiting the Hollywood Walk of Fame during the coronavirus pandemic.
Update: The teenager has been dropped from the list of deaths from Covid-19 in Los Angeles County, Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said on Thursday. She said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be completing the investigation of the teenager’s death.
A California teenager whose death was linked to the coronavirus may be one of the youngest victims of the outbreak in the United States.
Los Angeles County Department of Public Health on Tuesday said the death, of a 17-year-old boy from Lancaster, Calif., was from the coronavirus. Hours later, it walked back that statement, saying the death would be further evaluated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“The case is complex and there may be an alternate explanation for this fatality,” the health department said in a statement.
If the cause of death is confirmed as the coronavirus, it would be the first known instance of a minor dying from it in the United States. Some states, including New York, which has the most deaths in the country, have not reported the ages of most victims.
Gov. Gavin Newsom said half of the 2,102 people who have tested positive for the virus in California are between the ages of 18 and 49. “It is a reminder to everyone to take this seriously,” he said.

The teenager’s case grew more complicated after it was publicized. Just as the government was showcasing it as an example of why people in California should take the crisis more seriously, health officials were scrambling to get to the bottom of what had happened.
Mayor R. Rex Parris of Lancaster said on Tuesday that the 17-year-old did not have pre-existing health conditions and that he was healthy until he started having acute respiratory problems. He was treated at a hospital that released him without testing for the coronavirus, the mayor said.
The teenager, whose name has not been released, was then treated at a second hospital, where he died, the mayor said. The positive test results did not come back until after his death, and it was unclear when the test was taken.

“I’m really upset right now. I thought this was a disease that affected people my age,” said Mr. Parris, 68. “Now I realize our kids are at risk — that’s something totally different.”
On Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reported three deaths linked to the coronavirus, including the teenager, bringing the total number of deaths in the area to 11. Officials said that two people between the ages of 50 and 70, one with underlying heath conditions, had also died.
“Each loss we experience in L.A. County is tragic, and we are sending our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones who’ve had to endure this tragedy,” Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said in a statement. “Covid-19 does not discriminate by age, race or income level.”
Officials said 256 new cases had been reported across Los Angeles County over the last two days, bringing the total number of cases there to 662. In the United States, as of Tuesday night, there have been at least 53,478 cases of coronavirus confirmed by lab tests and 714 deaths, according to a New York Times database.
While the risk of dying is significantly higher in older people, C.D.C. data on nearly 2,500 of the first recorded cases in the United States has shown that younger adults made up a significant portion of coronavirus hospitalizations.
Children are also at risk. In Georgia, a 12-year-old girl who has Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was placed on a ventilator this week. Officials at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, where she is in stable condition, said the girl remained in isolation.
In a Facebook post, the girl’s cousin Justin Anthony wrote that the girl did not have any underlying health issues and that she had initially received a diagnosis of pneumonia. “For those of you that think that kids can’t get Covid-19 … Think Again!!!”
The girl’s family, through a representative, declined to comment beyond the post, saying, “We are hoping for good news soon and for her to make a healthy recovery.”
Stephen S. Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said there was still not enough data to say what effect the pandemic would have on youth. He said, however, that even in an ordinary flu pandemic, some young, otherwise healthy people get very sick or die.
“Unfortunately, we won’t know if this is that sort of rare tragic event, or a trend, until we have more data,” Dr. Morse said. “This one has been unusual in that it doesn’t seem to hit young people in the way that other flu pandemics have.”
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.

China to Ease Coronavirus Lockdown on Hubei 2 Months After Imposing It
The province will let people outside Wuhan leave for the first time since late January. Despite the official sign of confidence, many fear the virus is still spreading silently.
Workers with containers of disinfectant preparing on Tuesday to spray the central railway station in Wuhan, the city in Hubei Province that emerged in January as the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
HONG KONG — The Chinese province of Hubei, where the coronavirus pandemic began, will on Wednesday begin allowing most of its 60 million residents to leave, ending nearly two months of lockdown and sending a strong signal of the government’s confidence that its tough measures have worked to control the outbreak.
Wuhan, the provincial capital and the city hardest hit by the virus, will remain sealed off until April 8, though public transportation there will start running again, the government said.
The easing of the lockdown is the latest sign that China appears to have successfully tamed the epidemic by placing sweeping restrictions on hundreds of millions of people, while governments elsewhere flounder. Across Europe and the United States, new cases continue to surge, medical supplies are running low and many hospitals are overwhelmed. Government officials worldwide are ordering their citizens to stay at home — much as China did to Hubei at the start of the outbreak.
And the lifting of Hubei’s restrictions still do not mean free travel within China. Many provinces and cities have made it easier for residents to move around, but have essentially shut themselves off to travelers from elsewhere. China still faces a risk that a full resumption of travel, work and normal daily life could renew the virus’s spread, epidemiologists say.
“We need to worry about a second wave of the outbreak once restrictions are limited,” Malik Peiris, chief of virology at the University of Hong Kong, said. “It is important to be aware of it and monitor it — and be prepared to reimpose these measures if they become necessary in the future.”

Mayor Bill de Blasio says New York City has one week’s worth of medical supplies left.
C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
Not everyone is convinced the threat has fully passed. Hours before the loosening of restrictions was announced, officials in Wuhan, after several days of reporting zero new local infections, said a doctor there had tested positive for the virus.
News reports have also claimed that health officials are finding but not publicizing a number of people with asymptomatic infections, raising fears that the virus is still silently spreading. In addition, cases continue to climb among people arriving in China from overseas.
The human cost of sealing off a province of tens of millions of people for two months may not become clear for months or even years. While experts have praised China’s stringent lockdowns for containing the virus, the measures also came at a great price to people’s livelihoods and personal liberties.
In a sign of how the outbreak — and the government’s early attempts to conceal it — has eroded public trust, the apparent absence of new infections in Wuhan was not met with universal celebration. Instead, many worried that the government had failed to disclose or discover a much larger number of infections than the 81,171 cases to date.

The outcry and confusion were such that the Wuhan government released a statement on its official social media account on Sunday to rebut the assertions that the authorities were hiding new cases. Some of the cases cited in the photos had already been counted and reported earlier, the government said. Another patient who had tested positive was asymptomatic, and so would be monitored but not count as a confirmed case until he showed symptoms, the statement said.
Chinese officials count only patients with both symptoms and a positive test in their official tally of confirmed cases. The approach is at odds with the World Health Organization’s guidance that all people who test positive should be considered confirmed cases regardless of whether they show symptoms.
The question of how to count asymptomatic patients is at the heart of many fears about the true extent of the outbreak in China. On Sunday, the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, reported that asymptomatic patients, or “silent carriers,” could constitute as much as one-third of those who test positive, citing classified Chinese government data.
Caixin, a respected Chinese magazine, reported on Tuesday that dozens of asymptomatic patients were still testing positive in Wuhan each day but being excluded from public statistics reported by the government. The article cited an anonymous member of the team for infectious disease control and prevention in Wuhan.
Even if asymptomatic patients do not become sick themselves, they may be able to infect others. Experts say there might be an unknown number of asymptomatic patients beyond those already being monitored.
“Definitely asymptomatic infections are a potential cause for concern and for transmission,” Dr. Peiris at the University of Hong Kong said. He added, though, that it was “not feasible to test thousands and thousands of people who have absolutely no symptoms to look for evidence of asymptomatic infection.”
A spokesman for China’s Center for Disease Control on Tuesday played down the risks posed by asymptomatic patients. He said the known cases of asymptomatic infections had all been found among the close contacts of confirmed patients. They will still be closely monitored and isolated, even if they are not counted as confirmed cases, the spokesman, Wu Zunyou, said.
There will also be limits on who is allowed to travel: Those seeking to leave Hubei must have a “green” health code from the local authorities, certifying that they are healthy. The Chinese government has been classifying citizens’ health risks using technology on their smartphones.
Even as the Hubei authorities urged caution, they also made clear their desire to restart the economies of the province and China more broadly, which essentially ground to a halt during the coronavirus outbreak.
The Hubei authorities, in their announcement, urged local officials to restart production in an “active and orderly” fashion and to “work hard to minimize the losses caused by the epidemic, and regain normal economic and social development of the province as soon as possible.”

INSIDE THE OUTBREAK
ROME — For more than two weeks, the Italian government has trumpeted a central message for containing the spread of the coronavirus: Stay home.
Italy has recorded nearly 64,000 infections, the most in Europe, and more than 6,000 deaths, the most in the world. As the country struggles to contain the outbreak, the government has enacted strenuous new rules.

Because of social distancing, fewer guests can sit together at the long rows of tables in the kitchen’s main dining hall, so the charity stays open longer “to give everyone a chance to eat,” Ms. Zuccari said.
Those found violating the city’s quarantine laws can face fines of about $220 and up to three months in prison.
Charities struggle for money at the best of times, but St. Egidio now needs additional funds for face masks, food and hand sanitizer. Many of the older volunteers, who once staffed its kitchens or distributed box meals, have heeded government warnings to stay home.

Trump Expresses Outrage at Having to ‘Close the Country’ to Slow Virus
Fleeing New Yorkers told to quarantine as Trump says the U.S. should reopen ‘by Easter.’
This briefing is no longer updating. You can find the latest coronavirus news here.
White House: Anyone who has left New York should self-quarantine.
Trump expressed outrage at having to ‘close the country’ to slow the virus.
The country’s second-biggest state is not on lockdown.
Slow U.S. response to the virus created missed opportunities to make ventilators.
White House: Anyone who has left New York should self-quarantine.
Experts on the White House Coronavirus Task Force expressed alarm on Tuesday over infection rates in New York City, and advised people who have passed through or left the city to place themselves into 14-day quarantine.
Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator, said new infection hot spots on Long Island indicate that people leaving the city were already spreading the virus.
“Everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure the virus doesn’t spread to others no matter where they have gone, whether it’s Florida, North Carolina or out to far reaches of Long Island,” she said.
New York City is now being treated the way parts of China and Europe have been viewed, as an epidemiological hot zone. On Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said he would sign an order extending a self-isolation requirement to anyone who had traveled from the New York area in the last three weeks. Dr. Birx said that about 60 percent of  the country’s new cases were from the metro New York area.
Trump expressed outrage at having to ‘close the country’ to slow the virus.
Even as nations from Britain to India declare nationwide economic lockdowns, President Trump said he “would love to have the country opened up, and just raring to go, by Easter,” less than three weeks away, a goal that top health professionals have called far too quick.
[Update: Boris Johnson, U.K. Prime Minister, has the coronavirus.]
Participating in a town hall hosted by Fox News on Tuesday, he expressed outrage about having to “close the country” to curb the spread of the coronavirus and indicated that his guidelines on business shutdowns and social distancing would soon be lifted.
But at a late afternoon news conference, he softened his tone, saying his priority is the health and safety of the American people.
At the news conference, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, sought to refine Mr. Trump’s Easter timeline, saying it would not pertain to hot spots like New York. There could be “flexibility in different areas” based on data, he said.
“We need to know what’s going on in those areas in the country where there isn’t an obvious outbreak,” Dr. Fauci said. “It’s a flexible situation.”
Other health experts, however, have warned that a patchwork state-by-state approach could not contain a virus that doesn’t respect state borders.
Both Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence said that a lockdown had never been under consideration for the United States. Mr. Pence told Fox News viewers that talk of it was misinformation that has circulated online.
Mr. Trump fell back on his comparison of the coronavirus to the flu, saying that despite losing thousands of people to the flu, “We don’t turn the country off.”
States including California, Maryland, Illinois and Washington have declared stay-at-home or shutdown orders, but other states have been looking for directives from the Trump administration. And countries in Asia are beginning to see a resurgence of coronavirus after easing up on restrictions.
Mr. Trump has struck a remarkably different tone from other world leaders. In Italy, which has more coronavirus deaths than any other country, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on Tuesday that he was raising the fines on people who defy the lockdown order.
And in France, a scientific council that has been advising President Emmanuel Macron on the epidemic said that it was “indispensable” that authorities extend confinement measures beyond the initial 15-day period, possibly for a full six weeks.
As the outbreak picked up pace in New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who had adopted a friendly tone toward President Trump, came close on Tuesday to chastising the federal government, which he said had not sent enough ventilators to New York City.
Mr. Cuomo, speaking at the Javits Center in Manhattan, which the Army Corps is retrofitting into a 1,000-bed emergency hospital, said the rate of new coronavirus infections in New York is doubling about every three days. “We haven’t flattened the curve,” he said.
The peak of infection in New York could come in as little as two to three weeks, far earlier than previously anticipated, Mr. Cuomo said. The state now projects that it may need as many as 140,000 hospital beds to house virus patients, he said, up from the 110,000 projected a few days ago. As of now, only 53,000 are available.

N.Y.C. Mayor Bill de Blasio: City has one week’s worth of medical supplies
C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
As of Tuesday morning, New York State had 25,665 cases, with at least 157 deaths. There were around 15,000 cases in New York City alone.
The country’s second-biggest state is not on lockdown.
Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday continued to resist calls to issue a statewide order to keep millions of Texans in their homes as protection against the fast-moving virus, but he used strong language to encourage Texans to stay indoors. “The best thing that you can do to ensure that we are not spreading Covid-19 in the state of Texas is stay home, unless you need to be out,” Mr. Abbott said, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The country’s second-biggest state has been improvising its way through the crisis, influenced at times by the sheer span of Texas, by its partisan divides, by its rural-versus-urban split, by its top leaders’ support of Mr. Trump and by its small-government, low-regulation mythos.
Texas has more than 700 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 11 deaths, with most of the cases in major metropolitan areas. In nearly 190 of the state’s 254 counties, the most of any state, there are no confirmed cases at all.
As states attempt to stop the spread of coronavirus, more than half of all Americans will soon be under instructions to stay at home.

That was just one of several examples that underscored the price of the Trump administration’s slow response to evidence as early as January that the coronavirus was headed to the United States.
A California teenager whose death was linked to the coronavirus may be one of the youngest victims of the outbreak in the United States.
The death, of a 17-year-old boy from Lancaster, Calif., was announced by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health on Tuesday afternoon. Hours later, it backtracked, saying the death would be further evaluated by the C.D.C.
“The case is complex and there may be an alternate explanation for this fatality,” the health department said in a statement.
Some states, including New York, which has the most deaths in the country, have not reported the ages of most victims. Gov. Gavin Newsom, of California, said half of the 2,102 people who have tested positive for the virus in California were between the ages of 18 and 49.
Mayor R. Rex Parris of Lancaster said on Tuesday that the 17-year-old was healthy until he started having acute respiratory problems. He was treated at a hospital that released him without testing for the coronavirus, the mayor said.
The teenager was then treated at a second hospital, where he died, the mayor said. The positive test results did not come back until after his death.
In Georgia, a 12-year-old girl with the coronavirus was placed on a ventilator this week.
Kentucky’s governor says a person who attended a ‘coronavirus party’ has tested positive.
“We have a positive case today from someone who attended a ‘coronavirus party,’” Gov. Andy Beshear, Democrat of Kentucky, said during a news conference from Frankfort, the state’s capital, on Tuesday afternoon. “This is one that makes me mad, and it should make you mad.”
“We are battling for the health and even the lives of our parents and our grandparents,” he went on. “Don’t be so callous as to intentionally go to something and expose yourself to something that can kill other people. We ought to be much better than that.”
Already, many states have pushed their primaries into June in the hopes of waiting out the worst of the virus. Pennsylvania, slated for April 28, is likely to be next. Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden’s chief rival, has effectively converted his campaign into a pandemic policy shop and vessel for progressive activism as he confronts a significant delegate deficit. Planners for the Democratic National Convention said this week that they were assessing “contingency options” in case the July gathering cannot go on as planned.
India’s prime minister decreed a 21-day lockdown for the country of 1.3 billion.
India, the world’s second-most populous country, will order its 1.3 billion people to stay inside their homes for three weeks to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared on Tuesday.
The extensive lockdown order was declared a day after the authorities there grounded all domestic flights.
“Every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown,” he said. “If you can’t handle these 21 days, this country will go back 21 years.”
“The only option is social distancing, to remain away from each other,” he said. “There is no way out to escape from coronavirus besides this.”
Though India’s number of reported coronavirus cases remains relatively low, around 500, the fear is that if the virus hits as it has in the United States, Europe or China, it could be a disaster far bigger than anywhere else.
Mr. Modi also pledged to spend about $2 billion on medical supplies, isolation rooms, ventilators, intensive care units and training for medical personnel to combat the pandemic.

As the coronavirus pandemic moves around the globe, world leaders are scrambling to flatten the curve and save lives. But Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has been slow to adopt measures that could slow the virus’s spread.
Mexico, with its densely populated cities and high rates of poverty, obesity and diabetes, could be particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic. Yet even as the country documented its first deaths from Covid-19, Mr. López Obrador declined to restrict international travel and encouraged people to leave their homes to eat at restaurants.

Top Democrats and Trump administration officials on Tuesday said they were optimistic about finalizing an agreement on a roughly $2 trillion economic stabilization plan to respond to the pandemic, after striking a tentative deal to add oversight requirements for a $500 billion government bailout fund for distressed companies.
The Summer Olympics in Tokyo will be postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Tuesday’s decision came after months of internal discussion and mounting pressure from nations and athletes across the world who had urged that the Games, the world’s largest sporting event, be postponed. Government lockdowns to control the pandemic had shut down qualifying tournaments, closed training facilities and kept athletes sequestered at home.
The postponement came after Olympics officials in the United States, which sends the largest delegations of athletes to the Games, urged a postponement, echoing other influential Olympic committees.
Philippine and Thai leaders grab for emergency powers, raising concerns about potential abuse.
President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has been granted sweeping emergency powers to combat the coronavirus, triggering fears in a nation that spent the 1970s and ’80s under brutal martial law.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand declared a state of emergency, effective on Thursday, to combat the coronavirus, raising similar concerns about a potential abuse of power. Mr. Prayuth, a retired general who led an army coup in 2014, gave himself the authority to impose curfews, censor the media and prevent people from leaving their homes.
And in China, the province of Hubei, where the coronavirus pandemic began in late December, will on Wednesday begin allowing most of its 60 million residents to leave — ending nearly two months of lockdown and send a strong signal of the government’s confidence that its tough measures have worked to control the outbreak.
Wuhan, the provincial capital and the city hardest hit by the virus, will remain sealed off until April 8, though public transportation there will start running again within 24 hours, the government said.

Discussions to push back the state’s primary because of the coronavirus crisis came as several states that vote on Tuesday were cautiously moving ahead, and as Bernie Sanders voiced concerns.
New York officials are considering plans to postpone the state’s presidential primary election in April as fears over the coronavirus outbreak grow and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned against gatherings of more than 50 people.

Douglas A. Kellner, co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections, confirmed on Sunday that discussions were underway about the possibility of delaying the primary from April 28 to June 23 in the interest of containing the virus’s spread, but he added that no final decision had been reached. The decision ultimately would rest with the governor and the State Legislature, he said in an interview.
As four states — Ohio, Arizona, Florida and Illinois — have said they plan to go forward with voting on Tuesday amid concerns about the spread of the virus, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised questions on Sunday night about the wisdom of proceeding.

It does not make a lot of sense. I’m not sure that it does.”
In the past few days, elections officials around the country have been considering various changes in their elections schedules to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, with several others believed to be considering a delay or moving to mail-in balloting.
Mr. Cuomo, though, had recently taken several interim steps to minimize coronavirus exposure in the elections process, including reducing the number of signatures required on petitions that candidates for state and federal offices need to be placed on the ballot for the June 23 primary — a move he said was an effort to limit door-to-door canvassing.
In a statement on Sunday, the Democratic National Committee said a delay in New York’s election to June 23 would violate its rules requiring that all states hold their primaries by June 9, but added, “We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus.”

Andrew Cuomo to President Trump: Mobilize the Military to Help Fight Coronavirus
The time is growing short and fewer options are available. Using federal troops to help create hospital beds is one we should try.
The coronavirus pandemic is now upon us, and data from other countries shows us clearly where we are headed.
There is now only one question your team must answer for you: Can we slow the spread of the disease to a rate that our state health care systems can handle? The answer increasingly looks like no.
Slowing the spread of coronavirus is a function of testing and reducing the density of public gatherings. So first, Mr. President, you must stop the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from overregulating the testing process, and authorize states to certify a wider array of testing labs and methods.
On Friday, you said that your administration had agreed to allow New York State’s public health department to authorize local labs to perform the state’s approved coronavirus test — a good first step. Your administration also approved high-volume automated testing by the Swiss diagnostics maker Roche.
But these moves are insufficient. Because of the high demand for testing kits nationwide, many labs with Roche machines will be unable to obtain enough of the company’s testing kits for weeks or even months. There are other labs that can do high-volume coronavirus tests that do not use Roche kits. But these machines cannot be used without further F.D.A. approvals, of the sort Roche received on Friday.
That means that while New York is conducting thousands of tests a day, we are still below our full testing capacity because many labs still rely on low-volume manual testing.
Mr. Trump, don’t let bureaucracy get in the way of fighting this virus. Break the logjam, let states fully take over testing so they can unleash hundreds of labs tomorrow and bring testing to scale. It is the only way we will have a chance of keeping up with the rapid spread of this contagion.
All of this disruption will have immense financial and economic impact, and federal assistance will be needed to soften the blow. When schools close, localities will need help to provide meal programs to students and child-care programs to parents. Unemployment will skyrocket, as will insurance, health care and education costs.
Risks to hospitals
Third, you must anticipate that, without immediate action, the imminent failure of hospital systems is all but certain. According to one projection, as many as 214 million people in our country could be infected over the course of the epidemic. Of those, as many as 21 million people could require hospitalization.
This would crush the nation’s medical system. New York State has just 53,470 hospital beds, only 3,186 of which are intensive-care beds. Our country as a whole has fewer than one million staffed hospital beds, fewer proportionately than China, South Korea or Italy.
Ask your experts, how many intensive-care beds do we need for our vulnerable populations, and how many do we have now? The scarcity portends a greater failing and a worse situation than what we are seeing in Italy, where lives are being lost because the country doesn’t have the health care capacity.
States cannot build more hospitals, acquire ventilators or modify facilities quickly enough. At this point, our best hope is to utilize the Army Corps of Engineers to leverage its expertise, equipment and people power to retrofit and equip existing facilities — like military bases or college dormitories — to serve as temporary medical centers. Then we can designate existing hospital beds for the acutely ill.
In short: Localize testing, federalize shutdowns and task the Army Corps of Engineers to expand hospital capacity.
The Coronavirus Outbreak
Grocery stores have been working long hours to restock as a wave of panic buying has spread.
But the nation’s biggest retailers, dairy farmers and meat producers say that isn’t so. The food supply chain, they say, remains intact and has been ramping up to meet the unprecedented stockpiling brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

More live coverage: Global U.S. New York
Retailers say the frenzy started about two weeks ago, when customers could not find hand sanitizers and wipes, which were actually in short supply. But that set off a wave of panic buying that spread in recent days to include bread, canned goods, milk and frozen food.
Sign up to receive our daily Coronavirus Briefing, an informed guide with the latest developments and expert advice.
If the illnesses surge, of course, there could be a slowdown in production and distribution, food industry official say. But the extent of any problems could vary across the food chain. Slaughterhouse workers tend to work side by side, possibly making them at a higher risk of spreading the virus. But many dairy farmers operate in sparsely populated rural areas, improving their chances of staying healthy.
Still, industries are starting to make contingency plans in case large numbers of workers producing and delivering food are incapacitated by the virus or roads are shut down as part of the effort to control the pandemic. Representatives for companies that deliver food in refrigerated trucks, for example, are working with local and state officials to make sure they can still make deliveries during quarantines. Some refrigerated warehouse workers could rotate in 14 day shifts to make sure there is backup.
On Friday, officials from every part of the food chain — from fresh produce suppliers to refrigerated warehouses — met outside Washington, D.C., to discuss responses to the pandemic, including ideas for how to bolster parts of the system against disruptions.
“Will there potentially be some hiccups, and might you go to the store and not see everything every time?” said Lowell Randel, vice president for government and legal affairs at the Global Cold Chain Alliance, a trade group representing the refrigerated warehouse and delivery industry. “Yeah. But that’s a short-term disruption and not an indicator that the overall supply chain is not functioning.”
As this cycle continues, however, there is less chance suppliers can catch up with demand, stressing retail workers, who are already vulnerable to contracting the virus because of their constant interaction with the public.
Starting on Monday, the grocery chain Stop & Shop will reduce its hours in stores to give employees more time to restock shelves, but also to allow the workers to get more rest and stay healthy, a spokeswoman said.
Even if these efforts help slow down the current frenzy, retailers are expecting that the panic buying could come in waves, as the illnesses spike.

No gatherings of 50 or more for now, urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Sunday that no gatherings with 50 people or more — including weddings, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events or conferences — be held in the United States for the next eight weeks in one of the federal government’s most sweeping efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The C.D.C. said that its recommendation, which would drastically change life in the United States for the next two months, does not apply to “the day to day operation of organizations such as schools, institutes of higher learning, or businesses” and added that it was not intended to supersede the advice of local health officials.
“This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities,” it said, “and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus.”
And the C.D.C. urged people to take care with even small gatherings. “Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene and social distancing,” its recommendation said. “When feasible, organizers could modify events to be virtual.”
The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to near-zero and unveiled a sweeping set of programs — including plans to snap up huge amounts of government and mortgage-backed debt — in an effort to backstop the United States economy as the spread of coronavirus poses a dire threat to economic growth.
“The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,” the central bank said in a statement on Sunday. “The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.”
New York City’s public school system, the nation’s largest with 1.1 million students, will begin shutting down this week, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said on Sunday, in what is the city’s most aggressive and disruptive effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The city and union leaders are working on plans for emergency child care for essential city workers whose children attend public schools. Mr. Cuomo said earlier on Sunday that any decision to close New York City’s schools must include a plan to allow parents who are health care workers to continue to report to hospitals.
“I’m very, very concerned that we see a rapid spread of this disease, and it’s time to take more dramatic measures,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said.

Democratic presidential candidates focus early part of the debate on virus response.
As they faced off in a debate that was transformed in ways both large and small by the coronavirus pandemic, the two rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, both agreed on at least one thing: a greater role for the United States military in helping the nation deal with the outbreak.
“I would call up the military now,” Mr. Biden said. “They have the capacity to provide the surge help that hospitals need and is needed across the nation.”
Both men said that the pandemic was highlighting weaknesses in the health care system. Mr. Biden warned that it was ill-equipped to handle the expected surge of coronavirus cases, saying, “We should be planning where we are going to put these temporary hospitals.”
Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, said that it was highlighting the shortcomings of America’s for-profit health industry. “Let’s be honest and understand that this coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current health care system,” he said.
Both men — Mr. Biden is 77, and Mr. Sanders, 78 — said that they were taking steps during the campaign to avoid contracting the virus, including canceling events, using hand sanitizer and washing their hands regularly.
The coronavirus shaped not just the content of the debate, but its format, too. The face-off was moved to Washington, D.C., from Phoenix over concerns about the outbreak. There was no live audience, in an effort to promote the social distancing health experts are calling for. The candidates parried from lecterns that were kept six feet apart. And when they took the stage, they dispensed with the customary handshake in favor of a coronavirus-era elbow bump.
As the number of coronavirus cases in the United States climbed to over 3,100 across 49 states on Sunday, and after weeks of conflicting signals from the federal government, state and local officials across the nation began enacting stricter measures to try to slow the virus’s spread.
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom urged people 65 and older to shelter in their homes. “We are calling for the home isolation of all seniors in California,” Mr. Newsom said at a briefing Sunday. He also issued guidelines for the closure of all bars, brewpubs, nightclubs and wineries. The governor said that restaurants could remain open, but that they must reduce their occupancy by half in order to allow for more “social distancing” among diners.
Even as public health experts were publicly urging social distancing, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, went on Fox News and encouraged healthy people to dine out at restaurants. “Likely you can get in easily,” he said. “Let’s not hurt the working people in this country that are relying on wages and tips to keep their small business going.”
The scope of the public health crisis became even clearer over the weekend as officials in Louisiana, New York and Virginia reported their first deaths tied to the coronavirus. Only West Virginia was without a single diagnosis.
In the Omaha, Neb., area, officials reported the first known instance of community spread. In Illinois, a nursing facility where a woman tested positive was placed on lockdown. And in Pittsburgh, where the first local cases were announced on Saturday, city leaders urged bars to limit the number of people they allowed inside.
A sailor aboard the USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship crewed by hundreds, tested “presumptive positive” for the coronavirus Friday, the Navy said in a statement Sunday, marking the first case aboard a U.S. Navy ship.
Two American emergency-room doctors — one in Washington State and one in New Jersey — were in critical condition with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, the American College of Emergency Physicians said on Saturday. Dr. William Jaquis, the organization’s president, said it was unclear whether the doctor in Washington, who is in his 40s, had contracted the virus at the hospital. The physician in Paterson, N.J., who is 70, had been leading his hospital’s emergency preparedness.

Authorities in Texas began preparing judges for the possibility that they may have to be ready to order the quarantine of coronavirus patients who refuse to isolate themselves.
Despite the clearing out of grocery store shelves in recent days, the nation’s biggest retailers, dairy farmers and meat producers said the food supply chain remains intact and has been ramping up to meet the unprecedented stockpiling brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.
At the news conference on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Trump said he had a phone call with chief executives of several food suppliers who said they were committed to staying open through the coronavirus pandemic. He said the call was “very reassuring” and said there was no need to “hoard” essential food supplies.
Italy’s deaths jump, Germany closes borders and restrictions multiply around the world.
The coronavirus continued its assault on Italy, the hardest hit country outside of China, with officials on Sunday reporting the number of deaths rose to 1,809 — a 25 percent increase over the day before and the largest one-day uptick yet of any country.
The 368 deaths Italy reported exceeds the highest single-day number China reported at the height of its outbreak. China’s highest daily toll was on Feb. 13, when the country reported 254 new deaths, according to the World Health Organization.
The staggering caseload in Italy topped 24,700, even as the entire country has been locked down for a week, an escalation that is only likely to increase, raising urgent questions about how overloaded hospitals, particularly the hard-hit north, will cope.
Germany will close its borders with Austria, Denmark, France, Luxembourg and Switzerland in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the country’s interior minister said on Sunday, following several other European Union member states in restricting the freedom of movement across the continent.

On Sunday, Spanish officials reported nearly 8,000 cases of coronavirus and 288 deaths. The country ordered all residents to confine themselves to their homes — and to leave only to buy food, go to work, seek medical care or assist older people and others in need. The government also ordered all schools, restaurants and bars to close.
The Spanish authorities said that the prime minister’s wife, Begoña Gómez, had tested positive for the virus.
France announced the closing of all “non-indispensable” businesses, including restaurants, bars and movie theaters, after a sharp uptick in coronavirus cases. The number of French cases passed 5,420 on Sunday, with 127 deaths. On Saturday, 300 coronavirus patients were in critical condition — half of them under 60 years of age.
Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, announced on Sunday night that the country would shut down its borders for inbound foreigners for at least 15 days — one of the most drastic measures taken by a government seeking to keep the virus from spreading in a region that has relatively few diagnosed cases. Schools will close until at least the end of the month and cinemas, theaters and sporting events are canceled, he said.
One after another, countries around the world on Sunday continued to implement extraordinary measures as they raced to contain the spread of the coronavirus, closing schools, shuttering restaurants and bars, mandating quarantines and severely limiting travel.
China’s capital, Beijing, is toughening its rules for international arrivals, requiring everyone coming from overseas to spend the mandatory 14-day isolation at a quarantine site that they will be required to pay for.
The Netherlands announced a lockdown that will last until April 6, closing schools and child care facilities. Restaurants, cafes, gyms and sporting clubs will also be closed.
Manila, the densely populated capital of the Philippines, went under lockdown. Public gatherings are banned and classes suspended for a month; travel in and out of the Manila metropolitan area is restricted; and soldiers and police officers have set up traffic checkpoints to take people’s temperatures. Some in the country fear a return to a Marcos-style dictatorship.
A top U.S. health official says Americans should be prepared to “hunker down.”
A top health official said on Sunday that stronger efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus would roll out over the next several weeks, a period he characterized as crucial for controlling the outbreak.
Appearing across a number of Sunday morning news programs, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that travel bans enacted last week have helped curb transmission, but that U.S. citizens would have to make personal sacrifices and comply with government guidelines to avoid a “worst-case scenario.”
Underscoring the risk that the virus poses to the nation’s front-line medical workers, two emergency medicine doctors, in New Jersey and Washington State, are in critical condition as a result of the coronavirus, the American College of Emergency Physicians said.
“I don’t see that right now or in the immediate future,” he said on “This Week.” “But remember, we are very open-minded about whatever it takes to preserve the health of the American public.”
Mr. Goldman left the committee earlier this month. The panel’s chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Sunday that neither he nor any of his other aides were exhibiting symptoms. Mr. Schiff had already canceled public events and directed his staff to work from home.
As the U.S. government rushed on Saturday to implement Mr. Trump’s restrictions on travel from Europe, part of an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus, chaos ensued at some of America’s biggest airports.
Paige Hardy, an American student who left behind her graduate studies in London because she feared a broader travel ban, said a series of confusing announcements in the air and upon landing in Dallas led to alarm on the plane late Saturday. She posted a video on Twitter of travelers being asked to raise their hands if they had been in mainland Europe. Because of the delay, she also missed her connecting flight.
The confusion came as concern spread about the coronavirus pandemic, which has prompted Mr. Trump to declare a national emergency.
“At this time, we are working quickly with our partners to operationalize a plan which will outline where these travelers will be routed and what the screening process will be,” said Marcus Hubbard, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Starbucks said Sunday it was moving to a “to go” model for at least two weeks in the U.S. and Canada to encourage social distancing.
LVMH, the French company known for luxury items, said Sunday that it would redirect its cosmetic division to produce mass quantities of hydroalcoholic gel and give it to French health authorities.
As countries across Europe impose lockdowns and restrict travel, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain is facing a swelling tide of opposition to his government’s more relaxed measures to stem the coronavirus.
In an open letter, nearly 350 scientists and doctors called on him to immediately impose the kind of social distancing steps that countries like Italy, France and Spain have adopted.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the British broadcaster Sky News that the action plan under consideration including asking Britons over 70 to self-isolate for up to four months to reduce their risk of contracting the virus. The government is also expected to ban large gatherings starting next week and to order people over age 70 to remain at home.
The rate of infection in the country has been climbing as rapidly as elsewhere in Europe. Britain had at least 1,370 confirmed cases and 35 deaths as of Sunday, and the United States this weekend extended its ban on travelers from most of Europe to include those coming from Britain, as well.
A cruise ship is heading to France with a coronavirus quandary.
One of the infected passengers was so ill that the ship called an ambulance to pick her up during a stop in Puerto Rico, on March 8. Samples from her and her husband were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, delaying the diagnosis until this past Friday. Both were positive.
“The protection of the health and safety of passengers and crew members is a top priority for Costa Cruises,” the line said in a statement, adding that sanitation levels had been “further raised in order to guarantee the maximum level of hygiene and safety for guests and crew.”
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.

De Blasio Declares State of Emergency in N.Y.C., and Large Gatherings Are Banned
The number of coronavirus cases in the city and state continue to climb.
N.Y.C. declares a state of emergency.
Broadway will go dark for at least a month beginning Thursday after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced restrictions on public gatherings, an extraordinary step to fight the growing outbreak of the coronavirus.
Schools, hospitals, nursing homes and public transit will be exempt from the guidelines, which are to take effect Friday at 5 p.m., Mr. Cuomo said. Broadway theaters were subject to the new rules at 5 p.m. Thursday.  
Mr. Cuomo’s announcement came as health officials updated their figures to show 328 confirmed coronavirus cases in the state, with 112 added since Monday. One hundred and forty-eight of the cases were in Westchester County and 95 were in New York City.
In Nassau County on Long Island, 40 people had the virus, with 10 of them hospitalized and one person in critical condition, officials said.
N.Y.C. declares a state of emergency.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, appearing at an afternoon news conference, declared a state of emergency and said that the impact of the coronavirus on day-to-day life in the city “could easily” extend “for a half-year or more.”
Mr. de Blasio said that the city, which had 95 coronavirus cases on Thursday, could have 1,000 next week.
Among the steps the mayor said the city could take under a state of emergency were closing public transit, ordering people off the streets and rationing supplies. Curfews could be imposed and streets could be closed to vehicles, he said.

The mayor, speaking in a somber tone, said that developments since Wednesday related to the virus’s spread were “striking and troubling,” and he said that the continuing fallout would open a “hole in our lives.”
Hospital officials said that 22 patients were hospitalized in the city. The mayor said that hospitals would take drastic steps if necessary to increase capacity.
“There are three things we want to preserve at all cost: our schools, our mass transit system, and most importantly our health care system,” he said, while also calling for federal assistance.
Mr. de Blasio expressed frustration over how federal officials had limited the city’s ability to administer rapid, widespread testing for the virus.
“Our front line efforts right now must be to aggressively mitigate the potential for exposure and further spread,” Mr. Murphy said in a statement. “We are taking this step because social distancing works.”
Judith Persichilli, the state’s health commissioner, said that hospitals were already at capacity, which was a factor in the recommendation on public gatherings. The goal, she said, was to avoid a rapid spike in cases that would overwhelm the public health system.
With anxiety rising in New York, rumors began to circulate in hushed whispers, group chats and on social media that officials planned to shut down public transit and quarantine the city.

Even with the state’s limiting large gatherings in hopes of slowing the spread of the virus, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo made a point of saying public transit was an exception.
All public schools in Bergen County, N.J., the county with the most coronavirus cases in the state, will close at 3 p.m. Friday and shift to online instruction “until further notice,” the county executive, James J. Tedesco, said in a Facebook post late Thursday.
New Jersey announced six new positive coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing the statewide total to 29. Thirteen of the cases were in Bergen County, officials said, including a 16-year-old girl from Englewood.
City officials said late Thursday that the student did not in fact have the virus, and that the schools would reopen on Friday after a deep cleaning.
Mr. de Blasio said separately on Thursday that New York City public school assemblies, plays, after-school sports and other activities would be canceled as a result of the spread of virus.
The school, Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Catholic Academy in Forest Hills, Queens, was being disinfected after a suspected coronavirus case, the diocese said. It said that person had not been at school for the last two weeks.
The Met Museum, the Metropolitan Opera and others will close in response to the virus.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art said Thursday that it would temporarily close its Fifth Avenue flagship and two other locations — the Met Breuer on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the Met Cloisters in northern Manhattan — starting Friday in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
The Met said that two employees had shown symptoms of the virus. One was awaiting test results; the other was at home.
Late Thursday, the Chelsea Piers sports complex, citing the advice of public health officials, said it would shut down at midnight and remain closed at least through March 31. The company’s management said in a memo to the more than 1,000 people it employs that they were being put on a mandatory, unpaid furlough, but that their health benefits would continue and that they would receive some extra pay with their last check.
Religious institutions close their doors and offer guidance on social distancing.
The Rabbinical Council of Bergen County said in a statement that it made its decision after being told that public health officials “need our help to slow the spread of the disease before their resources are overwhelmed.”
The council said members of the community were “strongly encouraged” to work from home and to keep their children from socializing with classmates, which would undermine the purpose of closing schools.
Because of the outbreak, religious services were suspended at other houses of worship in the New York area. They included Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, one of the largest Presbyterian congregations in America, which said it would close on Sunday “for the foreseeable future”; and the Episcopal Church of the Epiphany, which said it would be closed through Sunday after its pastor, the Rev. Roy Cole, was diagnosed with Covid-19.
Father Cole was found to have the virus on Wednesday after “recent testing” but had already been discharged from the hospital, the church said in a statement. It said he was “following all instructions and receiving good care.”

Trump and Pence Won’t Be Tested After Meeting With Infected Brazilian Official
President Trump hosting President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, center left, on Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago estate. One of Mr. Bolsonaro’s aides later tested positive for the coronavirus.
WASHINGTON — President Trump will not be tested for the coronavirus after coming into contact with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus just days after participating in meetings with him in Florida, the White House said on Thursday.
She also indicated that neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Pence intended to self-quarantine as a precautionary measure. “There is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine,” Ms. Grisham said. “Exposures from the case are being assessed, which will dictate next steps.”

While the White House has indicated that its bar for testing the commander in chief is high, Dr. Judith N. Wasserheit, a professor of global health and medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle, recommended otherwise. “Because of the critical roles that the president and vice president play, it would be wise to have a low threshold for testing regardless of symptom status,” she said.
Dr. Thomas File, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said that anyone within five feet of an infected individual for five minutes or more had potential exposure to the virus. The recommendation for someone who had exposure would be to “stay home and monitor themselves” for 14 days, Dr. File said. “If they develop symptoms, they would be tested.”

And in Brazil, several cabinet members and the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, were awaiting test results amid fears that Mr. Wajngarten could have exposed members of the delegation. Mr. Bolsonaro also canceled a trip he had planned to make on Thursday, after spending the past few days playing down the risks of the virus.
Mr. Trump also chose not to get tested for the coronavirus last week after he had attended the Conservative Political Action Conference, where an attendee who was infected with the virus mingled with lawmakers. Four members of Congress — including Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who traveled with Mr. Trump on Air Force One last week — announced they were self-quarantining, citing an abundance of caution after coming into contact with the infected individual at the conference.
Mr. Trump, however, did not choose to take any precautionary measures. “He has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed Covid-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms,” Ms. Grisham said this week. “President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.”
In an interview with “Fox & Friends” this week, Ms. Grisham dismissed the coronavirus as “something that is like a flu” and said that when it came to his own exposure, Mr. Trump was “not concerned about this at all” because he “uses hand sanitizer all the time.”
Still, some experts warned the risk was high. “Any public figure, including the president, who really doesn’t want to get infected has to understand: They can no longer be in the public domain with person-to-person contact like this and not get infected,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. “This virus will penetrate into our population.”
In the past, presidents made a point of personally taking precautions as an example to the public. In 1976, when President Gerald R. Ford embarked on an ambitious crash program to vaccinate tens of millions of Americans against what was thought to be a dangerous new strain of influenza, he was photographed receiving the vaccine in the White House as part of a public awareness campaign.
In 2002, President George W. Bush was vaccinated against smallpox after American troops and civilian health care and emergency workers were ordered to have inoculations before the invasion of Iraq out of fear that the country’s leader, Saddam Hussein, had biological weapons.
Administration officials have said they would consider starting a public-relations campaign around testing if that becomes necessary. But they noted that the White House was not recommending mass testing across the country, focusing instead on older Americans with underlying health conditions.
Photo ops of Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence getting tested, they said, would be inconsistent with a message that people should follow the recommendations of their doctors, and that healthy Americans are likely to stay healthy.
Mr. Trump has also long resisted making his medical history public. The White House has still refused to provide any details about why he made an unannounced visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center four months ago. At the time, the White House described it as an “interim checkup,” and since then, Mr. Trump has been vague about when he plans to complete his annual physical.

Broadway, Symbol of New York Resilience, Shuts Down Amid Virus Threat
Facing restrictions on audience size and concern from actors and audiences about health risks during the coronavirus pandemic, the industry announced that shows will be shuttered through April 12.
The Majestic Theater, where “The Phantom of the Opera” has been playing since 1988. All Broadway theaters have been shut down to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
But on Thursday, facing a widening coronavirus pandemic and new limitations on large gatherings, the industry said it was suspending all plays and musicals for 32 days, effective immediately.
“The idea that our venerable, majestic houses are dark, and that there will be no lights on Broadway — I’m romanticizing, but that’s the heartbeat of the city, and to think that they’ve been forced into darkness is shocking,” said Patti LuPone, a beloved Broadway titan who has won two Tony Awards and has been performing in previews for a revival of “Company.” “I’m shocked that they took this tack, but also grateful they did, just to keep us healthy.”
The move came as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio enacted new restrictions to try to stop the spread of the virus, which in the city has infected nearly 100 people, a number expected to grow.
City and state officials banned most gatherings of more than 500 people, and required smaller venues to cut their capacity by half; they also limited nursing home visits. Mr. de Blasio declared a state of emergency, empowering him to take measures like implementing a curfew or limiting traffic should conditions worsen.
Public schools, however, were remaining open. The governor noted many children’s resistance to the virus, while the mayor expressed worry about the disruptions that school closings would create.

But Broadway has a lot of risk factors — many of its shows attract an older audience, and older people seem to be particularly susceptible to the coronavirus; it depends heavily on tourism, which is plunging as a result of the pandemic; and its theaters, lovely as they are, pack patrons into tight quarters, making the now-recommended social distancing essentially impossible.
As public health officials increasingly warned about the riskiness of large gatherings, and after a part-time usher was diagnosed with the virus, the drumbeat for closing grew louder.
“There’s no such thing as social distancing for actors — our jobs sometimes require that we go to work and kiss our colleagues eight times a week,” said the actress Kate Shindle, who is the president of Equity. “Although nobody wanted to close the theaters, at the same time people were starting to be scared to work, and with good reason.”
Broadway theaters did not close for the 1918 flu pandemic. But in more recent years they have shut down for labor disruptions, storms, and, on Sept. 11, terrorist attacks. Most of the closings were short (Broadway, urged to reopen by city officials, was back in business two days after the 2001 attacks), but many theaters were shut for 19 days by a stagehands’ strike in 2007 and 25 days for a musicians’ strike in 1975.

The men also said that Mr. Kirby had been speaking with executives at large companies, including banks, to understand the effect the outbreak is having on the broader economy and that United’s operational and finance teams were developing contingency plans to prepare for the virus’s spread.

The chief executive of Norwegian Air, Jacob Schram, said in a statement that Mr. Trump’s travel ban on European visitors “imposed further pressure on an already difficult situation.”
Last week, the International Air Transport Association estimated that the virus could wipe out as much as $113 billion in airline revenue worldwide, a forecast made before Mr. Trump’s latest travel restrictions and other limits by countries including Israel, Kuwait and Spain.
“Airlines will need emergency measures to get through this crisis,” Mr. de Juniac said on Thursday, calling on governments around the world to consider extending credit to airlines or reducing taxes and other costs.
In addition to Mr. Trump’s travel ban affecting the 26 European countries that make up the Schengen Area, the State Department warned Americans that they should reconsider all international travel, the most severe caution it can offer short of “do not travel.”
At an investor conference on Tuesday, the chief executives of Delta, United and American said that years of streamlining operations had prepared them to weather the effects of a crisis like the coronavirus outbreak and experts have said that they are more ready than their global peers.

The coronavirus has touched a diverse collection of countries and cultures, but a number of shared experiences have emerged — from grieving the dead to writing songs.
Economic package will include paid sick leave and free virus testing, aides said.
Congress on Thursday neared a deal with the White House on a sweeping economic rescue package to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
The legislation, Democratic aides said, will include enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing and aid for food assistance programs. The package also ensures 14 days of paid sick leave, as well as tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses fulfill that mandate. Language was still being drafted for provisions related to family and medical leave, according to a Democratic aide, as aides worked through the night to prepare the bill.
The fast-moving measure reflects a sense of urgency in Washington to enact a fiscal stimulus in the face of a pandemic that has wreaked havoc on the financial markets, which have proven impervious to other interventions.

“She is feeling well, is taking all the recommended precautions and her symptoms remain mild,” the statement said.
On the advice of physicians, Mr. Trudeau will continue to work from home for the next 14 days, the statement said, although he shows no symptoms and physicians are not testing him for the virus.
Earlier in the day the government said that Ms. Grégoire Trudeau felt ill after returning from a trip to Britain. Doctors decided to test for the coronavirus on Wednesday after she developed a mild fever, which has since passed.
Mr. Trudeau will make a speech to Canadians about the coronavirus pandemic on Friday following a conference call with the country’s provincial leaders
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced on Thursday that it was suspending all public gatherings around the world. The church is the first major religious tradition to issue such a global edict.

C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
The church previously suspended Sunday services for three months during the worldwide flu pandemic of 1918, said Matthew Grow, managing director of the church’s history department.
Stocks plunged in the United States on Thursday, after President Trump’s latest effort to address the coronavirus outbreak — a 30-day travel ban on people from most  European countries  — disappointed investors who have been looking for Washington to take steps to bolster the economy.
The travel ban hit shares in Europe particularly hard, with major stock indexes there down more than 10 percent. It also battered airline stocks. And with oil prices falling, energy companies were among the day’s biggest losers.
Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, said on Thursday that the league’s suspension of games because of the coronavirus would probably last “at least 30 days.” Mr. Silver, who was being interviewed on TNT’s “Inside the N.B.A.,” said it was also possible that the rest of the season would be canceled.
The N.B.A. announced on Wednesday that the season would be suspended after Rudy Gobert, a center for the Utah Jazz, tested positive for the coronavirus. Earlier in the week, Mr. Gobert had made light of concerns about the virus, which Mr. Silver referred to as a “huge mistake.” Mr. Gobert has since apologized on social media.
Charles Barkley, one of the hosts of “Inside the N.B.A.,” did not appear in the studio, joining instead by phone. He said he was self-quarantining for 48 hours after not feeling well after a flight from New York to Atlanta. He said he had been tested for the coronavirus but had not received the results. “I‘m just kind of in limbo right now,” Mr. Barkley said.
In England, the Premier League said it would go ahead with its scheduled slate of soccer matches this weekend, bucking a global trend that on Thursday saw leagues and competitions around the world cancel games, sometimes for weeks.

The Biden and Sanders campaigns close offices and tell staff to work from home.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign told staff members to work from home, closed all its offices to the public and said it would begin holding smaller events and virtual fund-raisers, according to an internal campaign memo released Thursday.
Mr. Biden’s main rival in the Democratic primary, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, took similar precautions. Mr. Sanders’s campaign said that it had asked all staff members to work from home and that it would no longer hold large events or door-to-door canvasses, focusing on digital outreach instead.
Italian doctors confront unthinkable choices about life and death.
Every day, the medical workers of northern Italy face an awful question: Which patients, whom you would have treated a few weeks ago, do you turn away now, or even allow to die?
With more than 15,000 infections diagnosed across the country, and more than 1,000 deaths, Italy is the hardest-hit region in Europe. It has turned into a test of the limits of a modern health care system swamped by an epidemic — and a terrifying glimpse of what other countries may soon face.
This week Italy imposed the most draconian measures outside of China — restricting movement and closing most businesses — to slow the spread of the virus.
But local officials report instances of overwhelmed doctors and nurses simply leaving some elderly patients untreated; hospitals sending people with pneumonia home; and hospital staffs having to choose who to deny the use of scarce equipment like ventilators. Medical workers are collapsing from exhaustion, and taking ill themselves.
“This is a war,” said Massimo Puoti, the head of infectious medicine at Niguarda Hospital in Milan, one of the largest in Lombardy, the province at the heart of the epidemic.
The restrictions, intended to slow a growing outbreak in the state, are expected to have a profound impact on the city’s cultural institutions, including theater, a multibillion dollar industry at the heart of New York’s tourist trade. The ban took effect at 5 p.m. Thursday for Broadway theaters and will do the same for other venues Friday at 5 p.m., Mr. Cuomo said. The Broadway League, a trade organization representing producers and theater owners, said the closing would last through April 12.
Later in the afternoon, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency and stressed that the city would be dealing with the effects of the coronavirus for the long haul.

Ohio’s action was the most sweeping. Gov. Mike DeWine said that all primary and secondary schools would close for three weeks starting on Monday. Ohio has just five known cases of the virus so far, but the governor said the move was meant to get ahead of the spread and help save lives.
And in Washington State, which has the most cases of any state in the nation, Governor Inslee said he had made the “very difficult decision” to close the schools in King, Snohomish and Pierce counties, the heart of the outbreak in the Seattle area, probably through late April.
President Alberto Fernández of Argentina said on Thursday that the government would suspend flights from the United States and Europe for 30 days in an effort to slow down the spread of the new coronavirus in the South American nation.
Mr. Fernández also announced strict quarantine protocols for people who arrive in Argentina after having traveled to places with a significant number of cases, including China, South Korea, Iran, Japan, Europe and the United States.
Argentina had 31 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Thursday, including one fatality.
Husband-and-wife pastors from Burkina Faso who traveled to France in February were found to have the coronavirus after they developed symptoms following Sunday services at their 12,000-capacity megachurch in their country’s capital, Ouagadougou.  
The possible mass exposure comes on a continent that has so far largely escaped the sweep of the virus across the globe. Egypt has the highest number of confirmed cases, with around 60, most of them aboard a Nile cruise ship. South Africa has 15, and there is a scattering of cases elsewhere in Africa, many involving Europeans.
Africa’s many megachurches and their vast congregations have been a source of worry for the spread of coronavirus, particularly after a large majority of the more than 7,800 cases in South Korea were traced back to the secretive Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
According to Le Monde, a French newspaper, almost 40 others who attended the Lenten prayer week, held in Mulhouse, France, carried the virus to other parts of France and to Guyana.
A top U.S. health official says coronavirus testing is “a failing.”  
‘That’s Really Disturbing’: Health Officials Grilled on Coronavirus Testing
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz pressed top health officials about the current shortcomings of the government’s coronavirus response.
One of the country’s top health officials said that the government’s coronavirus testing methods were inadequate in testimony on Capitol Hill on Thursday.
Speaking at a House committee hearing on coronavirus testing, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fielded pointed questions about rising frustration over a lack of testing kits across the country.  
“The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,” a statement from European leaders said. “The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.”
Italy’s government reported more than 15,000 infections through Thursday, a jump of more than 2,000, and more than 1,000 deaths. With the worst outbreak outside of China, Italy is under a national lockdown. In France, which has more than 2,280 cases, President Emmanuel Macron announced that the country’s schools and universities would close starting next week.
In appearances on several morning television shows on Thursday, Mr. Pence said that Americans returning from the affected area in the next 30 days would be required to self-quarantine for two weeks.  
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.

Lost Sense of Smell May Be Peculiar Clue to Coronavirus Infection
Doctor groups are recommending testing and isolation for people who lose their ability to smell and taste, even if they have no other symptoms.
A girl removed her mask to smell the flowers on a blooming tree in Skopje, North Macedonia, on Friday. Evidence is growing that lost sense of smell and taste are peculiar telltale signs of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
A mother who was infected with the coronavirus couldn’t smell her baby’s full diaper. Cooks who can usually name every spice in a restaurant dish can’t smell curry or garlic, and food tastes bland. Others say they can’t pick up the sweet scent of shampoo or the foul odor of kitty litter.
Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell, and ageusia, an accompanying diminished sense of taste, have emerged as peculiar telltale signs of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and possible markers of infection.
On Friday, British ear, nose and throat doctors, citing reports from colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other symptoms, to slow the disease’s spread. The published data is limited, but doctors are concerned enough to raise warnings.
She and Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT UK, a group representing ear, nose and throat doctors in Britain, issued a joint statement urging health care workers to use personal protective equipment when treating any patients who have lost their senses of smell, and advised against performing nonessential sinus endoscopy procedures on anyone, because the virus replicates in the nose and the throat and an exam can prompt coughs or sneezes that expose the doctor to a high level of virus.
Two ear, nose and throat specialists in Britain who have been infected with the coronavirus are in critical condition, Dr. Hopkins said. Earlier reports from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus first emerged, had warned that ear, nose and throat specialists as well as eye doctors were infected and dying in large numbers, Dr. Hopkins said.
The British physicians cited reports from other countries indicating that significant numbers of coronavirus patients experienced anosmia, saying that in South Korea, where testing has been widespread, 30 percent of 2,000 patients who tested positive experienced anosmia as their major presenting symptom (these were mild cases).

N.Y.C. Mayor Bill de Blasio: City has one week’s worth of medical supplies
C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
The American Academy of Otolaryngology on Sunday posted information on its website saying that mounting anecdotal evidence indicates that lost or reduced sense of smell and loss of taste are significant symptoms associated with Covid-19, and that they have been seen in patients who ultimately tested positive with no other symptoms.
The symptoms, in the absence of allergies or sinusitis, should alert doctors to screen patients for the virus and “warrant serious consideration for self isolation and testing of these individuals,” the academy said. The organization has reminded its members that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged all clinicians to prioritize urgent and emergency visits for the next several weeks and to reschedule elective and routine procedures.
“There is evolving evidence that otolaryngologists are among the highest risk group when performing upper airway surgeries and examinations,” said a notice posted on the academy’s website on Friday. “A high rate of transmission of Covid-19 to otolaryngologists has been reported from China, Italy and Iran, many resulting in death.”
Dr. Rachel Kaye, an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Rutgers, said colleagues in New Rochelle, N.Y., which has been the center of an outbreak, first alerted her to the smell loss associated with the coronavirus, sharing that patients who had first complained of anosmia later tested positive for the coronavirus. “This raised a lot of alarms for me personally,” Dr. Kaye said, because those patients “won’t know to self quarantine.”
In the areas of Italy most heavily affected by the virus, doctors say they have concluded that loss of taste and smell is an indication that a person who otherwise seems healthy is in fact carrying the virus and may be spreading it to others.

“Almost everybody who is hospitalized has this same story,” said Dr. Marco Metra, chief of the cardiology department at the main hospital in Brescia, where 700 of 1,200 inpatients have the coronavirus. “You ask about the patient’s wife or husband. And the patient says, ‘My wife has just lost her smell and taste but otherwise she is well.’ So she is likely infected, and she is spreading it with a very mild form.”
A study from South Korea, where widespread testing has been done, found that 30 percent of some 2,000 patients who tested positive for the coronavirus reported experiencing anosmia.
Hendrik Streeck, a German virologist from the University of Bonn who went from house to house in the country’s Heinsberg district to interview coronavirus patients, has said in interviews that at least two-thirds of the more than 100 he talked to with mild disease reported experiencing loss of smell and taste lasting several days.
Another physician who studied a cluster of coronavirus patients in Germany said in an email that roughly half of the patients had experienced a smell or taste disorder, and that the sensory loss usually presented after the first symptoms of respiratory illness, but could be used to distinguish people who should be tested.
Dr. Clemens Wendtner, a professor of medicine at the Academic Teaching Hospital of Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, said that the patients regained their ability to smell after a few days or weeks, and that the loss occurred regardless of how sick they got or whether they were congested. Using nasal drops or sprays did not help, Dr. Wendtner said.
Several American patients who have had symptoms consistent with the coronavirus, but who have not been tested or are still awaiting test results, described losing their senses of smell and taste, even though their noses were clear and they were not congested.
Andrew Berry, 30, developed a fever and body aches about 10 days ago, and then a sore throat and debilitating headaches. He tested negative for influenza and has not gotten the result of a coronavirus test taken four days ago, but his physician was convinced that he had the virus, he said.
Amy Plattmier, a woman from Brooklyn, was not tested for the coronavirus during a recent illness, but her husband then became sick and had a positive test. Ms. Plattmier said she usually had a very sensitive nose, but now could barely smell anything — not the bleach she was using to clean the counters, which usually makes her feel nauseated, or the dog’s accident in the bathroom, which she cleaned up.

13 Deaths in a Day: An ‘Apocalyptic’ Coronavirus Surge at an N.Y.C. Hospital
Hospitals in the city are facing the kind of harrowing increases in cases that overwhelmed health care systems in China and Italy.
‘People Are Dying’: 72 Hours Inside a N.Y.C. Hospital Battling Coronavirus
An emergency room doctor in Elmhurst, Queens, gives a rare look inside a hospital at the center of the coronavirus pandemic. “We don’t have the tools that we need.”
In several hours on Tuesday, Dr. Ashley Bray performed chest compressions at Elmhurst Hospital Center on a woman in her 80s, a man in his 60s and a 38-year-old who reminded the doctor of her fiancé. All had tested positive for the coronavirus and had gone into cardiac arrest. All eventually died.
Elmhurst, a 545-bed public hospital in Queens, has begun transferring patients not suffering from coronavirus to other hospitals as it moves toward becoming dedicated entirely to the outbreak. Doctors and nurses have struggled to make do with a few dozen ventilators. Calls over a loudspeaker of “Team 700,” the code for when a patient is on the verge of death, come several times a shift. Some have died inside the emergency room while waiting for a bed.
A refrigerated truck has been stationed outside to hold the bodies of the dead. Over the past 24 hours, New York City’s public hospital system said in a statement, 13 people at Elmhurst had died.
“It’s apocalyptic,” said Dr. Bray, 27, a general medicine resident at the hospital.
Across the city, which has become the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, hospitals are beginning to confront the kind of harrowing surge in cases that has overwhelmed health care systems in China, Italy and other countries. On Wednesday evening, New York City reported 20,011 confirmed cases and 280 deaths.
More than 3,922 coronavirus patients have been hospitalized in the city. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday offered a glimmer of hope that social-distancing measures were starting to slow the growth in hospitalizations statewide. This week, the state’s hospitalization estimations were down markedly, from a doubling of cases every two days to every four days.
Still, hospitals are under siege. New York City’s hospitals run the gamut from prestigious teaching institutions catering to the elite to public hospitals providing care for some of the poorest communities in the nation. Regardless of whom they serve, few have been spared the impact of the pandemic: A flood of sick and fearful New Yorkers has besieged emergency rooms across the city.
Working with state and federal officials, hospitals have repeatedly expanded the portions of their buildings equipped to handle patients who had stayed home until worsening fevers and difficulty breathing forced them into emergency rooms. Elmhurst, among the hardest-hit hospitals in the city, is a prime example of the hardships medical centers and their staffs are facing across the country.
“Elmhurst is at the center of this crisis, and it’s the number one priority of our public hospital system right now,” the city’s public hospital system’s statement said. “The front line staff are going above and beyond in this crisis, and we continue surging supplies and personnel to this critical facility to keep pace with the crisis.”
Dr. Mitchell Katz, the head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which operates New York City’s public hospitals, said plans were underway to transform many areas of the Elmhurst hospital into intensive care units for extremely sick patients.
But New York’s hospitals may be about to lose their leeway for creativity in finding spaces.
All of the more than 1,800 intensive care beds in the city are expected to be full by Friday, according to a Federal Emergency Management Agency briefing obtained by The New York Times. Patients could stay for weeks, limiting space for newly sickened people.

Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he had not seen the briefing. He said he hoped that officials could quickly add units by dipping into a growing supply of ventilators, the machines that some coronavirus patients need to breathe.
A doctor at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens said it had faced “the first wave of this tsunami.” 
The federal government is sending a 1,000-bed hospital ship to New York, although it is not scheduled to arrive until mid-April. Officials have begun erecting four 250-bed hospitals at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Midtown Manhattan, which could be ready in a week. President Trump said on Wednesday on Twitter that construction was ahead of schedule, but that could not be independently confirmed.
Officials have also discussed converting hotels and arenas into temporary medical centers.
At least two city hospitals have filled up their morgues, and city officials anticipated the rest would reach capacity by the end of this week, according to the briefing. The state requested 85 refrigerated trailers from FEMA for mortuary services, along with staff, the briefing said.
A spokeswoman for the city’s office of the chief medical examiner said the briefing was inaccurate. “We have significant morgue capacity in our five citywide sites, and the ability to expand,” she said.
In interviews, doctors and nurses at hospitals across the city gave accounts of how they were being stretched.
Workers at several hospitals, including the Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, said employees such as obstetrician-gynecologists and radiologists have been called to work in emergency wards.

At a branch of the Montefiore Medical Center, also in the Bronx, there have been one or two coronavirus-related deaths a day, or more, said Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, a nurse. There are not always enough gurneys, so some patients sit in chairs. One patient on Sunday had been without a bed for 36 hours, she said.
At the Mount Sinai Health System, some hospital workers in Manhattan have posted photos on social media showing nurses using trash bags as protective gear. A system spokesman said she was not aware of that happening and noted the nurses had other gear below the bags. “The safety of our staff and patients has never been of greater importance and we are taking every precaution possible to protect everyone,” she said.
With ventilators in short supply, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, one of the city’s largest systems, has begun using one machine to help multiple patients at a time, a virtually unheard-of move, a spokeswoman said.
Elmhurst Hospital Center opened in 1832 and moved to its current Queens location in 1957, making it one of the oldest hospitals in New York City.
In the neighborhood it serves, Elmhurst, more than two-thirds of residents were born outside of the United States, the highest such rate in the city. It is a safety-net hospital, serving mainly low-income patients, including many who lack primary care doctors.
Queens accounts for 32 percent of New York City’s confirmed coronavirus cases, more than any other borough and far more than its share of the city’s population. It also has fewer hospitals. Elmhurst is one of three major hospitals serving a large population and is centrally located, which in part explains why it is busy in normal times and even busier now.
Medical workers said they saw the first signs of the virus in early March — an increase in patients coming in with flulike symptoms before the alarm had been fully raised in the city and the country. Tests results were taking longer then, but they eventually confirmed that many of these patients had coronavirus.
In the weeks after, the emergency room began filling up, with more than 200 people at times. Every chair in the waiting room was usually taken. Patients came in faster than the hospital could add beds; earlier this week, 60 coronavirus patients had been admitted but were still in the emergency room. One man waited almost 60 hours for a bed last week, a doctor said.
Like other hospitals, Elmhurst has come perilously close to running out of ventilators several times; other hospitals have replenished its supply.
Despite the more optimistic projections by the state about hospitalization rates, the crowds outside of Elmhurst have not thinned out.
The line of people waiting outside of Elmhurst to be tested for the coronavirus forms as early as 6 a.m., and some stay there until 5 p.m. Many are told to go home without being tested.
Julio Jimenez, 35, spent six hours in the emergency room on Sunday night after running a fever while at work in a New Jersey warehouse. He returned on Monday morning to stand in the testing line in the pouring rain. On Tuesday, still coughing, eyes puffy, he stood in line for nearly seven hours and again went home untested.
“I don’t know if I have the virus,” Mr. Jimenez said. “It’s so hard. It’s not just me. It’s for many people. It’s crazy.”
Rikki Lane, a doctor who has worked at Elmhurst for more than 20 years, said the hospital had handled “the first wave of this tsunami.” She compared the scene in the emergency department with an overcrowded parking garage where physicians must move patients in and out of spots to access other patients blocked by stretchers.
Other doctors said they had tried to resuscitate people while drenched in sweat under their protective gear, face masks fogging up. Some patients have been found dead in their rooms while doctors were busy helping others, they said.
That is what Dr. Bray said she tried to do before the man who reminded her of her fiancé died on Tuesday. As it turned out, his mother, also stricken with the coronavirus, was a patient at another hospital.

The Coronavirus Outbreak
WASHINGTON — If you want to shut down an economy to fight a pandemic without driving millions of people and businesses into bankruptcy, you need the government to cut some checks. The coronavirus response deal that the Senate passed late Wednesday will get a lot of checks into the mail, but it will soothe only a few months of financial pain.
If the outbreak and the disruptions continue through summer, lawmakers will need to spend even more.
The bill, a compromise between the Trump administration and Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress, includes loans and grants for corporations and small businesses, increased unemployment benefits for workers laid off or working fewer hours amid the outbreak, and direct payments to low- and middle-income individuals and families. Negotiators estimate its cost at $2 trillion.
Taken together, those measures form a novel, temporary expansion of the federal government’s role in the economy: It will be essentially paying millions of Americans not to work, and thousands of businesses not to shut down even if they have no customers, in order to slow the spread of the pandemic. Its cost is more than double the roughly $800 billion stimulus package that Congress passed in 2009 to ease the Great Recession. Yet it still may not be large enough, given the enormous economic challenge the United States faces today.
The economy, which has been shuttered to control the spread of the virus, does not need a jolt to get moving again. The government is just trying to tide people and firms over until it is safe to start back up.
More live coverage: Global U.S. New York
Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he hoped the economy will be “reopened” by Easter, in two and a half weeks. Public health experts and a wide range of economists say that is both unlikely and inadvisable. The country still lacks widespread testing for the virus, and confirmed infections and deaths continue to climb rapidly.
The extraordinary measures that mayors and governors have taken to restrict economic activity, which at their most extreme include shutting down all nonessential businesses and ordering people to shelter in the homes, are unlikely to show success in “bending the curve” of the virus for at least another week. If they prove effective, and the infection rate slows dramatically, activity could be back to normal — or at least something that reasonably resembles it — within a few months for many businesses and workers.

“The response looks to be proportionate to the extent of the problem,” said Justin Wolfers, a University of Michigan economist who has pushed for a large fiscal response to sustain the economy through the virus shutdown. But, he said, “we have no idea what the extent of the problem is.”
Those programs are in part meant to encourage companies to keep workers on their payrolls. Even if workers are furloughed without pay, the government will essentially step in and assume paying their salaries while the workers continue to be covered by any health insurance provided by their employers.
For workers who lose their jobs, the bill supplies expanded unemployment benefits for up to four months. For many, those payments will match or even exceed the wages they were earning before the outbreak.
“Nothing is perfect around here,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said in a Tuesday speech on the Senate floor. “But if you make perfect the enemy of the good, you’re going to hurt more people, more small businesses will shut, more people will be out on their own and there will be more and more people who will be infected with this virus who otherwise could have been saved.”
Policy experts and business lobbyists have been warning for days that congressional failure to reach a deal was causing more companies to shutter and workers to lose their jobs. Some said on Tuesday that lawmakers needed to be ready to start work on another plan to avoid any additional losses if the outbreak effects stretch into summer and fall.

India, Day 1: World’s Largest Coronavirus Lockdown Begins
NEW DELHI — India’s economy was sputtering even before its leader announced the world’s largest coronavirus lockdown. Now the state-ordered paralysis of virtually all commerce in the country has put millions of people out of work and left many families struggling to eat.
On the first day of the nationwide 21-day shutdown of nearly all services on Wednesday, the streets of Mumbai, India’s largest metropolis — usually so busy it’s known as Maximum City — were silent. Shuttered shops, empty train tracks, closed airports and idle factories all across the country were signs of the economic impact of the social distancing that the Indian government said was necessary to prevent new coronavirus infections.
India has reported 606 coronavirus cases so far, but with the population density so high and the public health system so weak, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered the country’s 1.3 billion residents to stay inside to keep India from sliding into a disaster that could potentially dwarf what China, Italy, Spain, the United States and other countries have faced.
But Mr. Modi’s effort to prevent the spread of the virus will lead to its own calamitous damage.

Although India is likely to escape a recession, Barclays said, such a significant slowdown would mean rising joblessness in a country where millions of young people enter the work force every year.
Mr. Modi acknowledged the trade-offs in a televised address on Tuesday night, when he first announced the nationwide lockdown.
“No doubt this lockdown will entail an economic cost for the country, but saving the life of each and every Indian is the first priority for me,” he said. “If we are not able to manage the next 21 days, then many families will be destroyed forever.”

The lockdown includes schools, offices, factories, parks, temples, railways, even the airspace. To impose social distancing where people are ordinarily squeezed together, exempted businesses and the authorities are looking to devise solutions.
In the city of Meerut, the police began shaming people caught evading the lockdown, forcing them to hold signs — later posted on social media — stating they did not care about protecting society.
“They fear the disease,” said Kapil Wagarhande, a villager.

Passengers began disembarking on Wednesday from a cruise ship docked off Yokohama, Japan, as a two-week quarantine of the vessel was coming to an end even as a major coronavirus outbreak on board continued unabated.
An initial group of about 500 people were to leave the boat on the first day of what the Japanese authorities have said will be a three-day operation to offload those who have tested negative for the virus and do not have symptoms. Passengers who shared cabins with infected patients have been ordered to remain on the ship.
Several countries have arranged charter flights to take their nationals home after they leave the boat. Most if not all of these passengers face an additional two-week quarantine in their home countries.
The disembarkation is taking place even as at least 542 passengers aboard the ship, the Diamond Princess, have been infected with the virus. On Tuesday, the authorities announced an additional 88 cases on the ship, which originally carried about 3,700 passengers and crew members.
More than half of all the recorded cases outside China, the center of the epidemic, have been aboard the ship.
Many of the infected had already been removed from the ship and taken to nearby hospitals. More than 300 Americans, at least 14 of whom were infected, had also been taken off the boat earlier this week and placed in a 14-day quarantine at military bases in the United States.
But more than 100 Americans who were not evacuated on chartered flights cannot return home for at least two more weeks, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.
[Update: More than 500 coronavirus cases confirmed in China’s prisons.]
The agency said in a statement that virus containment measures on the ship “may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission.”
“C.D.C. believes the rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk,” it added.
Passengers will not be allowed to return to the United States until they have been off the ship for 14 days, without any symptoms or a positive test for the virus, the agency said. The decision applies to those who have tested positive and are hospitalized in Japan, and to those who are still aboard the ship.
Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak
The virus has infected more than 672,500 people in at least 171 countries.
On Wednesday, the number of confirmed new cases in China appeared again to be slowing, and was put at 1,749. That brought the country’s total number of reported infections to 74,185. Deaths in the previous 24 hours were put at 136, bringing the total to 2,004.
The economic pain from the epidemic is continuing to spread.
Economic fallout from the epidemic continued to spread on Tuesday, with new evidence emerging in manufacturing, financial markets, commodities, banking and other sectors.
HSBC, one of the most important banks in Hong Kong, said it planned to cut 35,000 jobs and $4.5 billion in costs as it faces headwinds that include the outbreak and months of political strife in Hong Kong. The bank, based in London, has come to depend increasingly on China for growth.
Jaguar Land Rover warned that the coronavirus could soon begin to create production problems at its assembly plants in Britain. Like many carmakers, Jaguar Land Rover uses parts made in China, where many factories have shut down or slowed production; Fiat Chrysler, Renault and Hyundai have already reported interruptions as a result.

About 500 people will be released on Wednesday from a quarantined cruise ship that has been a hot spot of the outbreak, Japan’s health ministry said, but confusion about the plan was widespread.
The ministry said only those who had tested negative and were asymptomatic would be allowed to leave the Diamond Princess, which has been moored off Yokohama since Feb. 4.
The authorities said 2,404 people on the ship had been tested for the virus, and earlier in the day, the ministry announced that 88 additional infections had been confirmed. That brought the total on the ship to 542.
The release coincides with the expiration of a two-week quarantine imposed on the ship, but it was not clear if that was the reason for letting people go. More than 300 Americans were released this week before that period was completed.
Some public health experts say that the 14-day isolation period makes sense only if it begins with the most recent infection a person might have been exposed to — in other words, new cases mean a continuing risk of exposure and should restart the quarantine clock.
In addition, many infected people have tested negative initially, only to test positive days later, after becoming sick. The Japanese announcement suggested that Japanese people who are released will not be isolated, a decision officials did not explain.
The director of a hospital in Wuhan has died from the virus.
The director of a hospital in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the epidemic, died on Tuesday after contracting the new coronavirus, the latest in a series of medical professionals to be killed in the epidemic.
Liu Zhiming, 51, a neurosurgeon and the director of the Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, died shortly before 11 a.m. on Tuesday, the Wuhan health commission said.
“From the start of the outbreak, Comrade Liu Zhiming, without regard to his personal safety, led the medical staff of Wuchang Hospital at the front lines of the fight against the epidemic,” the commission said.
Chinese medical workers at the forefront of the fight against the virus are often becoming its victims, partly because of government missteps and logistical hurdles. After the virus emerged in Wuhan late last year, city leaders played down its risks.
Last week the Chinese government said that more than 1,700 medical workers had contracted the virus, and six had died.
The death nearly two weeks ago of Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist who was initially reprimanded for warning medical school classmates about the virus, stirred an outpouring of grief and anger. Dr. Li, 34, has emerged as a symbol of how the authorities controlled information and have moved to stifle online criticism and aggressive reporting on the outbreak.
With just 42 cases of the coronavirus confirmed in Europe, the continent faces a far less serious outbreak than China. But the people and places associated with the illness have faced a stigma as a result, and fear of the virus is, itself, proving contagious.
One British man who tested positive for the virus was branded a “super spreader,” and his every movement was detailed by the local media.
In France, business plummeted at a ski resort identified as the scene of several transmissions of the virus.
And after some employees of a German car company were found to have the virus, the children of other workers were turned away from schools, despite negative test results.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, warned last weekend of the dangers of letting fear outpace facts.
“We must be guided by solidarity, not stigma,” Dr. Tedros said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference. Fear, he said, may hamper efforts to combat the outbreak. “The greatest enemy we face is not the virus itself,” ge said. “It’s the stigma that turns us against each other.”
The Philippines has lifted its travel ban on citizens employed as domestic workers in Hong Kong and Macau, officials said Tuesday.
Hong Kong alone is home to about 390,000 migrant domestic workers, many of them from the Philippines. The travel ban had left many anxious about the sudden loss of income.
On Tuesday, the authorities in Hong Kong announced that a 32-year-old Filipino woman was the latest person in Hong Kong to have contracted the virus, bringing the number of confirmed cases there to 61. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the woman was a domestic worker.
President Moon Jae-in of South Korea warned on Tuesday that the outbreak in China, his country’s biggest trading partner, is creating an “emergency economic situation,” and ordered his government to take actions to limit the fallout.
Passengers from a cruise ship were turned away at an airport as they tried to leave Cambodia on Tuesday, amid fears that the country had been too lax in containing the coronavirus.
The ship, the Westerdam, was turned away from five other ports over virus fears, but Cambodia allowed it to dock last Thursday. Prime Minister Hun Sen and other officials greeted and embraced passengers without wearing protective gear.
More than 1,000 people were allowed to disembark. Other countries have been far more cautious; it is not clear how long after infection people develop symptoms, and some people at first test negative for the virus, even after becoming sick.
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.
The Coronavirus Outbreak
[This article is part of the developing coronavirus coverage, and may be outdated. Go here for the latest on the coronavirus.]
When the stock market falls, as it has all week, there is a natural desire to search for explanations and consult crystal balls. While the spread of the coronavirus has been a catalyst, nobody knows exactly why the market moved the way it did, including whether underlying economic troubles are contributing to the severity of the gyrations. And nobody can tell you how the virus will affect the United States, including whether the outbreak’s short-term economic impact will reduce long-term profits.
Still, declines like the one investors experienced this week rarely feel good. And maybe you’re getting queasy about the economic implications of an outbreak that could force millions of Americans to shut themselves in for a while. If so, remind yourself of the following: Stocks are how your savings fight inflation, the market is not an absolute proxy for your personal finances, and you’re playing a long game — the very same points I raise every time we’ve worried about the stock market in recent years.

So, stop. Think. Talk to someone with more experience, or a sober-minded approach. Shift a bit of your portfolio to cash if it helps your anxiety. But drastic investment moves are sensible only when there have been drastic changes in your life, like a big new job or consequential medical news. And that hasn’t happened for most of us this week.

For 12 days he had been hooked up to a ventilator in the intensive care unit of a Kenner, La., hospital, his wife, Heaven, and their son, Ethan, quarantined in their home nearby.
Ms. Frilot said that a two-month recovery likely awaits as doctors continue to treat his pneumonia, a journey that will be followed by far more than just his family: Since first sharing her husband’s story, Ms. Frilot has become a light of sorts for her conservative community in Louisiana and beyond, in which many had written off the pandemic as partisan fear-mongering.

But in New York, where the cobbled streets of SoHo have shuddered to a standstill as state measures to slow the spread of the virus have taken hold, a number of elegant luxury boutiques, including Fendi, Celine and Chanel, did not just shutter storefronts this week; they had them boarded up with vast sheets of plywood, as if in anticipation of riots and civil disobedience, similar to how they react to European protests. But some are cautioning against the practice.
In the first week since New York State announced a stay-at-home order to help fight coronavirus, real estate listings in Manhattan have plunged and the spring buying season has ground to a halt.
The virus is not only keeping new sellers on the sidelines, but leading many to pull their listings from public view altogether, said Noah Rosenblatt, the chief executive and founder of UrbanDigs.
Many fishing ports across the United States, long imperiled and struggling under strict regulations and the declines of valuable fish and shellfish stocks, have fallen even quieter during the pandemic.
In Rhode Island, where state regulations forbid quahoggers from selling clams directly to consumers, the result is that the fleet has all but stopped working — even though catches were high and people, wary of going into crowded and picked-over grocery stores, are eager for healthy meals.
Looking to create beauty and build community in the time of social distancing, the artist Liza Lou is inviting other artists along with the general public to join her in a communal art project called “Apartogether.” She introduced the concept on her Instagram page last week, cuing people to begin gathering old clothes and materials around the house from which to piece together a quilt or what she’s calling a “comfort blanket.” (Ms. Lou showed herself hugging her own baby blanket.)

Two undetected Covid-19 cases contribute to labor restrictions.
A triage tent outside of NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Two women recently delivered there who were asymptomatic but were later found to have Covid-19.
The two women showed no signs of infection when they arrived last week at a top New York City hospital to deliver their babies.
But soon after the babies were born, the mothers’ conditions “deteriorated very quickly,” and they were admitted to the intensive care unit, said Dr. Mary D’Alton, the chief obstetrician and gynecologist at the NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center in Manhattan.
The women had undetected Covid-19, and more than 30 health care workers were exposed to the coronavirus before the women were diagnosed — prompting the NewYork-Presbyterian hospital network to bar partners and other support people from labor and delivery rooms, a policy that was implemented on Monday for all its maternity patients.
The babies do not seem to have contracted the virus so far. One of the mothers was discharged four days after delivering, but the other mother remains hospitalized.
Online videos help black women learn to braid while social distancing.
Several black women have joined a virtual hair-braiding class on Facebook to learn how to keep their hair healthy while staying home during the coronavirus pandemic. Many are parents trying to learn how to do their children’s hair.
Niani Barracks usually tends to clients at a salon in Detroit, but now that she must stay indoors because of the coronavirus pandemic, she has been running her fingers through the hair of a mannequin head affixed to a stand in her home, as a dozen other black women, who paid $5 each, watch her on Facebook Live.
The skill is essential for many black women trying to keep their hair healthy while they practice social distancing. Braids are the foundation of many protective hairstyles, like wigs and hair extensions.
With nonessential businesses closing and nearly two dozen states urging at least , Facebook has experienced a sharp increase in the use of its Live feature, which lets users broadcast videos. Most of the students in Ms. Barracks’s class are black women hoping to learn how to braid while salons and barbershops have shuttered to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
In a moment that was instantly relatable for people who are struggling emotionally with the coronavirus pandemic, Hoda Kotb, one of the co-anchors of “Today,” broke down in tears on Friday, shortly after interviewing Drew Brees, the quarterback of the New Orleans Saints, who was appearing on the show to discuss his charitable work.
Ms. Kotb discussed with Mr. Brees that he and his wife, Brittany, had donated $5 million to the state of Louisiana to help with the outbreak that has been particularly severe in New Orleans. But shortly after she told Mr. Brees, “We love ya,” she was briefly unable to continue. Her co-anchor, Savannah Guthrie, quickly jumped in to tell Ms. Kotb to take a moment, and a video of the interaction was tweeted out by “Today” and drew an intense reaction online.
As life has increasingly moved online during the pandemic, an older generation that grew up in an analog era is facing a digital divide. Often unfamiliar or uncomfortable with apps, gadgets and the internet, many are struggling to keep up with friends and family through digital tools when some of them are craving those connections the most.
That is problematic now when many people 65 and older, who are regarded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as most at risk of severe illness related to the coronavirus, are shutting themselves in. Many nursing homes have closed off to visitors entirely. Yet people are seeking human interaction and communication through the web or their devices to stave off loneliness and to stay positive.
The Covid-19 pandemic is gutting the global economy and forcing entire nations into quarantine. While reporting on devastation that is incomprehensibly big, our reporters have been accumulating in their notebooks some moments that are compelling because they are small.
In the “New York Shuttered” series, the photographer Todd Heisler — with occasional help from some reporters — is capturing what it is like to live in New York City during the coronavirus pandemic.
Amid the shutdown of large gatherings and nonessential businesses, Gallop NYC, which specializes in therapeutic riding for people with emotional, developmental and physical challenges, had to cancel all its programs. The measures being taken to fight the spread of coronavirus, specifically the orders to stay at home, are “going to have a huge toll on people with disabilities,” said the executive director, James Wilson.
The coronavirus, for all its devastation, is spreading a spirit of forgiveness across America and softening the country’s often uncompromising lock-’em-up ways.
All of these holy days and celebrations, which promote renewal and reflection, involve gathering around meals. Social distancing has suddenly posed a big barrier, and some festivities have been called off.
So a couple of recent evenings lately have found me peering into my laptop, watching plays that were digitally immortalized before the coronavirus thwarted their respective opening nights, and the runs that would have followed.
U.S. Lags in Coronavirus Testing
After Slow Response to Outbreak
Coronavirus testing data has been spotty and not easily available, especially in the United States. Based on official government sources, here’s how testing efforts in the United States compare with those in Italy and South Korea.
Coronavirus Cases and Daily Testing by Country
4,400 confirmed cases
134,000 tests
28,000 confirmed cases
Tests data not available before Feb. 25
8,300 confirmed cases
Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Italy Department of Civil Protection; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Delays in testing in the United States have set back the nation’s response to the pandemic, even though its first case was discovered around the same time that South Korea’s was. But part of the problem in the United States has also been gaps created by the way the state and federal agencies report the data.
An internet community effort, called the COVID Tracking Project, is attempting to provide a fuller picture of testing in the United States. According to the tracker — which collects information directly from state health departments, local news reports and live news conferences — at least 41,000 people have been tested in the United States, much higher than official C.D.C. figures.
It has been difficult to track reliable testing data in the United States for a number of reasons. Data from the Centers for Disease Control, which lags several days, reports the number of specimens tested, not the number of people — multiple specimens can be tested from each person. And some states report only positive results, not negative ones, making it hard to know the total number tested.
The COVID Tracking Project’s data, however, lays bare just how behind the United States has been in responding to the pandemic, which by Monday night had sickened more than 178,000 people worldwide, according to official accounts.
Coronavirus Tests Per One Million People
Note: Data is from country health departments where available. Press reports and statements were used otherwise. The U.S. estimate is based on the most recent data from the COVID Tracking Project.
Through intensive testing and monitoring, South Korea has managed to slow the growth of new cases. Health officials there tracked down people with symptoms and even set up drive-through testing, allowing at least 10,000 people to be tested per day. Government websites and mobile apps disclosed how many people had been tested and where.
Italy has also tested aggressively for the virus, which could help explain why its total confirmed cases are higher than every other country in Europe. Health officials in Lombardy — Italy’s hardest-hit region — initially carried out swab tests on those who were sick as well as those who came into contact with infected people, even if they had no symptoms.
Until now, testing in the United States has been done manually, with individual labs performing only 40 to 60 tests a day. Testing has ramped up in recent days — on Monday, the COVID Tracking Project’s count of reported tests rose by 13,000, suggesting a surge in the nation’s testing.
Also on Monday, federal officials said they were moving ahead with plans to set up more drive-through testing centers around the country and to speed the processing of tests by commercial labs. By the end of the week, officials said that 1.9 million tests should be available.
Note: Data for confirmed cases begins on Jan. 22. Testing data is collected from the national health agencies of each country.

Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count
More than 2,100 people with the coronavirus have now died in the United States, according to a New York Times database, a figure that has doubled since Thursday and continues to rise sharply as deaths are reported by the dozens or hundreds in New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Michigan and elsewhere.
Note: The map shows the known locations of coronavirus cases by county. Circles are sized by the number of people there who have tested positive, which may differ from where they contracted the illness. Some people who traveled overseas were taken for treatment in California, Nebraska and Texas. Puerto Rico and the other U.S. territories are not shown. Sources: State and local health agencies, hospitals, C.D.C. Data as of 12:11 P.M. E.T., Mar. 29.

The increase in deaths comes as governors across the country seek scarce ventilators and implore residents to stay at home. With infection rates expected to continue increasing, convention centers are being converted into makeshift medical centers, hospital ships on both coasts are preparing for patients and some places are screening travelers with out-of-state license plates.
As of Sunday afternoon, at least 125,903 people across every state, plus Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories, have tested positive for the virus, according to a New York Times database, and at least 2,149 patients with the virus have died.
The outbreak in this country, where there are now more known cases than in China or Italy, looks vastly different than it did a month ago. At the start of March, with extremely limited testing available, only 70 cases had been reported in the United States, most of them tied to overseas travel. With testing now more readily available, at least 18 states now have more than 1,000 known cases within their borders, including Indiana, where officials said Saturday that the death toll had risen to 31.
See our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak for the latest news.
As the number of known cases reached into the hundreds, then the thousands, then the tens of thousands, life across the country has changed in swift, profound ways. School playgrounds and college quads now stand deserted. Nail salons, department stores and barber shops have been forced to close. Baseball’s spring training, college basketball tournaments and concert tours have been called off. Some states have told people arriving from elsewhere to quarantine themselves. Others have warned that the pause on public life will likely last weeks more.
New coronavirus cases announced in the U.S. each day

The New York Times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track the details of every confirmed case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest information our journalists are gathering from around the country. The Times has made that data public in hopes of helping researchers and policymakers as they seek to slow the pandemic and prevent future ones.

When a cluster of coronavirus cases was first reported in the New York City suburb of New Rochelle, local and state officials raced to contain the outbreak. The National Guard deployed. Drive-through testing began. Epidemiologists attempted to find contacts of the first patients.
Within a few days, though, it became clear that the virus was still spreading. With ramped-up testing, hundreds of new patients were being identified in Westchester County, on Long Island and in all five New York City boroughs. Dozens of other counties reported their first cases, and several announced deaths.
By Saturday, New York’s death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 780, by far the most of any state. The governor, Andrew Cuomo, ordered many businesses to close, urged retired doctors to return to work and asked for federal help in marshaling more hospital equipment. Next week, a temporary hospital will open in a Manhattan convention center.
“We are losing people every day,” Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said on Thursday. “The next few months will be painful and stress our health care system like never before.”
STATE CASES DEATHS
Though New York has had by far the most cases, other Northeastern states have also seen their case totals increase rapidly. New Jersey now has the second-highest number of known cases in the country. In Massachusetts, more than 100 people are being diagnosed each day. In Connecticut, dozens of new patients have been identified on each recent day.
In America’s nursing homes, outbreaks grow.
Across the country, a pattern has played out with tragic consistency: Someone gets sick in a nursing home. Soon, several residents and employees have the coronavirus.
Older people and those with underlying health problems are most vulnerable to Covid-19, making the consequences of a nursing home outbreak especially devastating. At least 37 deaths have been linked to an outbreak at the Life Care nursing facility in Kirkland, Wash. Many of the victims were in their 80s or 90s.
In New Orleans and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., multiple deaths have been tied to senior centers. In Wisconsin, the National Guard was sent to a long-term care facility where three people have died. Similar outbreaks have been reported in Ohio, in Colorado and in Morgantown, W.Va., where more than 20 residents and employees have been infected.
Though many of the first coronavirus cases in the United States were tied to overseas travel, localized outbreaks have become increasingly common. New clusters in nursing homes and other places, including on an aircraft carrier in Guam and at a church in Arkansas, are emerging each day. Public health officials often are unable to identify how people are becoming ill. The table below shows known cases for which Times journalists have been able to identify how the virus was contracted or a connection to other cases.
The growth in cases of unknown origin has signaled to public health officials that Americans are being exposed to the virus at work, at shopping centers and in travel hubs, prompting calls for people to stay home. Among recent cases: several Navy sailors in Guam, the Detroit police chief and the mayor of Aurora, Ill.
When the coronavirus began spreading in the United States, the vast majority of cases were in coastal states. Illinois and Wisconsin had only a few cases. Michigan, Missouri and Ohio had none.
But this week, all of those states have reported alarming new statistics. Many of the new cases and deaths have been concentrated in the Midwest’s largest cities.
In Detroit, more than 1,300 cases have been identified and at least 30 people have died. Seven deaths and more than 480 cases have been reported in Milwaukee County, Wis. In Chicago, where officials said Saturday that an infant with the virus had died, there are more than 1,600 cases.
The areas around Cleveland, St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo., have also seen fast spikes, leading officials to warn that medical facilities could be overwhelmed.
“What we do now will determine if we overrun Ohio’s hospitals and get to a situation where our medical teams are making life and death decisions,” the state’s governor, Mike DeWine, said Thursday. “We don't want to be in that position. I worry about this every day.”
Louisiana: Deaths and cases continue to grow
At the start of March, with large outbreaks already reported on both coasts, officials in Louisiana had not yet identified a single case of the coronavirus. But in the days since, the state has been pummeled. At least 3,315 Louisianans had been infected and at least 138 had died. Gov. John Bel Edwards has warned that the New Orleans area could run out of ventilators by early April.
“We still remain on the growth curve, the trajectory that we don’t like,” Mr. Edwards said Friday, days after he warned that the state’s situation could soon mirror the public health crisis in Italy.
In New Orleans, where the most cases had been identified, drive-through coronavirus testing has become the norm and public gatherings have been banned.
STATE COUNTY CASES DEATHS
Outbreaks in jails and prison could be hard to contain
At the county jail in Chicago, at least 47 cases involving inmates and staff members have been tied to the virus. In South Dakota, several inmates escaped from a women’s prison after someone there tested positive for the virus. In the federal system, at least 27 inmates and prison workers across the U.S. have tested positive for the virus, including in New York and Louisiana.
The New York Times has spoken with more than a dozen workers in the Bureau of Prisons in recent days who have said that federal prisons are ill-prepared for a coronavirus outbreak. Many lack basic supplies, like masks, hand sanitizer and soap.
“We do not have enough gloves,” said a prison employee at the U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta, where a cluster of coronavirus cases has appeared, involving at least two inmates and one staff member. The worker spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from the Bureau of Prisons. “We do not have enough masks; we do not have the supplies needed to deal with this. We don’t have enough space to properly quarantine inmates.”
Coronavirus Outbreak Get?
As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, a flurry of early research is drawing a clearer picture of how the pathogen behaves and the factors that will determine how much it can be contained.
How contagious is the virus?
It seems to spread very easily, making containment efforts difficult.
How deadly is the virus?
It’s hard to know yet. But the fatality rate may be more than 1 percent, much higher than the seasonal flu.
How long does it take to show symptoms?
How much have infected people traveled?
Enough to spread the outbreak all over the world.
How long will it take to develop a treatment or vaccine?
A few drugs are being tested in clinical trials, but a vaccine is still at least a year away.
While the virus is a serious public health concern, you are very unlikely to get infected outside of areas where it is spreading widely, including China, Italy, Iran and South Korea. To avoid any viral illness, experts advise washing your hands frequently and avoiding your office or school when you’re sick. Most healthy people don’t need masks, and hoarding them may contribute to shortages for health workers who do need them, experts say.
How contagious is the virus?
It seems to spread very easily, making containment efforts difficult.
The scale of an outbreak depends on how quickly and easily a virus is transmitted from person to person.
The new coronavirus seems to spread very easily, especially in homes, hospitals, churches, cruise ships and other confined spaces. It is much more contagious than SARS, another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 and sickened about 8,000 people.
The pathogen can travel through the air, enveloped in tiny respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes.
These droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. That makes the virus harder to get than pathogens like measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, which can travel 100 feet through the air. But it is easier to catch than H.I.V. or hepatitis, which spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.
How far viruses travel
Coronaviruses can travel only about six feet from the infected person. It’s unknown how long they live on surfaces.
Some other viruses, like measles, can travel up
Research is still in its early stages, but some estimates suggest that each person with the new coronavirus could infect between two and four people without effective containment measures. That is enough to sustain and accelate an outbreak, if nothing is done to reduce it.
Here’s how that works. In the animation below, a group of five infected people could spread the virus to about 368 people over just five cycles of infection.
If 5 people with new coronavirus each infected 2.6 others ...
Compare that with a less contagious virus, like the seasonal flu, which can be slowed by vaccines and immunity from past epidemics. People with the flu tend to infect 1.3 other individuals, on average. The difference may seem small, but the result is a striking contrast: Only about 45 people might be infected in the same scenario.
If 5 people with seasonal flu each infected 1.3 others ...
The transmission numbers of any disease aren’t set in stone. They can change depending on how much people interact at school, work or religious gatherings. When global health authorities methodically tracked and isolated people infected with SARS in 2003, they were able to bring the average number each sick person infected down to 0.4, enough to stop the outbreak.
Health authorities around the world are expending enormous effort trying to repeat that. But the number of people infected globally is rising quickly, with large clusters of cases in Italy, Iran, Japan and South Korea.
The virus’s high rate of transmission means containment measures — such as wearing masks, keeping a distance from infected people and implementing quarantines if people are exposed — must block more than 60 percent of transmissions in order to effectively control the outbreak, which is difficult.
Coronavirus cases have far surpassed the rate of new SARS cases in 2003:
Covid-19
SARS
The first day that W.H.O. received reports of the outbreaks
Notes: The official World Health Organization case count for SARS was delayed at the beginning of the outbreak. Some cases were suspected but not confirmed; SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, so previously reported cases may have been discarded after further investigation. New coronavirus data as of Feb. 27.
How deadly is the virus?
It’s hard to know yet. But the fatality rate may be more
than 1 percent, much higher than the seasonal flu.
This is one of the most important factors in how damaging the outbreak will be, and one of the least understood.
It’s tough to assess the lethality of a new virus. The worst cases are usually detected first, which can skew our understanding of how likely patients are to die. People with mild illness may never visit a doctor, and there may be more cases than China is counting, leading to a lower death rate than initially thought.
“It’s easier to miss mild cases that resolve by themselves than it is to miss dead people,” said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health.
But early research indicates the virus may be significantly more deadly than the seasonal flu, which kills roughly one in 1,000 people. An analysis of outcomes for more than 44,000 confirmed patients in China found that roughly one in 50 died. Eighty-one percent of patients infected with the new coronavirus had mild illness, 14 percent had severe illness and 5 percent had critical illness, according to the study.
The pathogen is considerably less dangerous than other coronaviruses, such as MERS, which kills about a third of people who become infected, and SARS, which kills about 1 in 10. All of the diseases appear to latch on to proteins on the surface of lung cells, but MERS and SARS seem to be more destructive to lung tissue.
Here’s how the new coronavirus compares with other infectious diseases:
Fatality rate
Bird flu
SARS
Spanish flu
New coronavirus
fatality rate below 3%,
flu
2009 flu
Average number of people infected by each sick person
Note: Average case-fatality rates and transmission numbers are shown. Estimates of case-fatality rates can vary, and numbers for the new coronavirus are preliminary estimates.
The chart above uses a logarithmic vertical scale: data near the top is compressed into a smaller space to make the variation between less-deadly diseases easier to see. Diseases near the top of the chart are much deadlier than those in the middle.
Older people are much more likely to face serious illness than younger people, the analysis of Chinese patients found. In that study, nearly 15 percent of infected people over 80 died, along with 8 percent of people in their 70s. Very few young children seem to be falling ill, a pattern seen with some other respiratory viruses.
Those numbers could be reduced as more cases are discovered. And it is possible that death rates at the center of the outbreak in China, where hospitals were overwhelmed, will end up higher than elsewhere in the world.
Pathogens can still be very dangerous even if their fatality rate is low. Even though influenza has a case fatality rate below one per 1,000, roughly 200,000 people end up hospitalized with the virus each year in the United States, and about 35,000 people die.
How long does it take to show symptoms?
The time it takes for symptoms to appear after a person is infected can be vital for prevention and control. Known as the incubation period, this time can allow health officials to quarantine or observe people who may have been exposed to the virus. But if the incubation period is too long or too short, these measures may be difficult to implement.
Some illnesses, like influenza, have a short incubation period of two or three days. People may be shedding infectious virus particles before they exhibit flu symptoms, making it almost impossible to identify and isolate people who have the virus. SARS had an incubation period of about five days, and it took four or five days after symptoms started before sick people could transmit the virus. That gave officials time to stop the virus and effectively contain the outbreak.
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the new coronavirus has an incubation period of two to 14 days. When symptoms do start to appear, they can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
But mild cases may simply resemble the flu or a bad cold, and people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even before they develop obvious symptoms.
“That concerns me because it means the infection could elude detection,” said Dr. Mark Denison, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
How much have infected people traveled?
Enough to spread the outbreak all over the world.
Wuhan was a difficult place to contain an outbreak. It has 11 million people, more than New York City. On an average day, 3,500 passengers take direct flights from Wuhan to cities in other countries. These cities were among the first to report cases of the virus outside China.
China was not nearly as well connected in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. Large numbers of migrant workers now travel domestically and internationally — to Africa, other parts of Asia and Latin America, where China is making an enormous infrastructure push with its Belt and Road Initiative. This travel creates a high risk for outbreaks in countries with health systems that are not equipped to handle them, like Zimbabwe, which is facing a worsening hunger and economic crisis.
Over all, China has about four times as many train and air passengers as it did during the SARS outbreak:
When SARS broke out, there were about 1 billion travelers.
In January, China took the unprecedented step of imposing travel restrictions on tens of millions of people living in Wuhan and nearby cities. Some experts questioned the effectiveness of the lockdown, and Wuhan’s mayor acknowledged that five million people had left the city before the restrictions began, in the run-up to the Lunar New Year.
“You can’t board up a germ. A novel infection will spread,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “It will get out; it always does.”
Several countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea, are already discovering clusters of cases with no clear ties to the outbreak's epicenter in China. On Feb. 26, the C.D.C. also reported what it called possibly the first case of community spread in the United States.
World Health Organization officials have praised China’s aggressive response to the virus — walling off cities, forcing people to stay home and tracking large numbers of contacts of infected people — saying that it helped curb the spread of more cases. The daily tally of new cases there peaked and then plateaued between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2, and has steadily declined since.
Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness. Airlines and cruise lines have canceled service to many Asian destinations.
The rate at which transmissions are spreading in several countries makes it seem “unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,” said Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore.
The ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend on the strength of their health systems; their capacity to test, provide hospital beds, drugs and respirators for severely ill patients; and their effectiveness in communicating to the public.
How long will it take to develop a treatment or vaccine?
but a vaccine is still at least a year away.
There are no approved treatments for any coronavirus diseases, including the new coronavirus.
Several groups are also working to develop a vaccine for the virus in order to stop the spread of the disease. But vaccines take time.
After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.) By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the development timeline down to six months.
Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline even further. Researchers have already studied the genome of the new coronavirus and found the proteins that are crucial for infection. Scientists from the National Institutes of Health, in Australia and at least three companies are working on vaccine candidates.
“If we don’t run into any unforeseen obstacles, we’ll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Dr. Fauci cautioned that it could still take months, and even years, after initial trials to conduct extensive testing that can prove a vaccine is safe and effective. In the best case, a vaccine may become available to the public a year from now.

Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak
The coronavirus pandemic has sickened more than 678,900 people, according to official counts. As of Sunday afternoon, at least 31,971 people have died, and the virus has been detected in at least 171 countries, as these maps show.
Sources: Local governments; The Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University; National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China; World Health Organization.
There is evidence on six continents of sustained transmission of the virus. The C.D.C. has advised against all non-essential travel throughout most of Europe, and to South Korea, China and Iran. And the agency has warned older and at-risk Americans to avoid travel to any country.
CASES DEATHS NEW CASES
Notes: New cases are represented as seven-day averages. Japan’s count includes 696 cases and seven deaths from a cruise ship that docked in Yokohama. The data excludes cases on the Zandaam cruise ship, which has not yet docked. France and the U.S. figures include overseas territories.
While the outbreak is a serious public health concern, most people who contract the coronavirus do not become seriously ill, and only a small percentage require intensive care. Older people and those with existing health conditions, like heart or lung disease, are at higher risk.
Follow the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak.
The number of known coronavirus cases in the United States continues to grow quickly. As of Sunday afternoon, at least 125,903 people across every state, plus Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories, have tested positive for the virus, according to a New York Times database, and at least 2,149 patients with the virus have died.
Note: The map shows the known locations of coronavirus cases by county. Circles are sized by the number of people there who have tested positive, which may differ from where they contracted the illness. Some people who traveled overseas were taken for treatment in California, Nebraska and Texas. Puerto Rico and the other U.S. territories are not shown.

See our page of maps, charts and tables tracking every coronavirus case in the U.S.
The New York Times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track details about every confirmed case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state and local officials around the clock. Many people are infected despite having no known connection to previous cases, which suggests local, person-to-person spread of the virus.
As the coronavirus pandemic continues to surge across Europe, there are now more total confirmed cases outside of China than inside China, the country where the virus first spread.
Total confirmed coronavirus cases
Many of the cases across Europe have been traced back to Italy, which has one of the world’s largest outbreaks. At least 92,472 people have tested positive as of Sunday afternoon.
Confirmed cases
The outbreak is believed to have begun in a seafood and poultry market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China. The virus seems to spread very easily, especially in confined spaces, making containment efforts difficult. It is difficult to know how many people who contract the virus die, but some early estimates put the fatality rate at roughly 1 percent.
Confirmed cases

The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know. Not all infected people have received a diagnosis, and some countries, like Singapore, have more proactive testing and containment efforts than others do.
Experts’ understanding of how the virus spreads is still limited, but there are four factors that likely play a role: how close you get; how long you are near the person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much you touch your face.
Keep distance from sick people. Try to stay six feet away from anybody showing flu- or cold-like symptoms, and don’t go to work if you’re sick.
Here’s a complete guide on how you can prepare for the coronavirus outbreak.

The Coronavirus Outbreak
Celebrities, Athletes and Politicians Who Have Tested Positive for Coronavirus
They are among the hundreds of thousands who have tested positive for the coronavirus as it has spread around the world. Many of the famous figures, by going public with their diagnoses, have helped put a face to the virus, sharing updates via social media and giving interviews about their symptoms and conditions.
Here’s a roundup of public figures who have announced that they have the virus.
Idris Elba: The actor posted a video on social media on March 16 to announce that he had contracted the coronavirus. “Listen, I’m doing OK,” he said in the video, appearing with his wife, Sabrina Dhowre Elba, who later tested positive herself. “I didn’t have any symptoms,” he added.
Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson: The Academy Award-winning actor and his wife, Ms. Wilson, both 63, said in a statement on March 11 that they were in Australia and had the coronavirus. Mr. Hanks was set to film a movie there about the life of Elvis Presley.
“Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers, too,” Mr. Hanks said in the statement. “To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive.”
On March 28, Mr. Hanks announced on Twitter that he and Ms. Wilson were home “and, like the rest of America, we carry on with sheltering in place and social distancing.”
Plácido Domingo: The opera star, 79, disclosed on Facebook that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, writing on March 22, “I feel it is my moral duty to announce to you that I have tested positive.” He wrote that he had decided to get tested because he had a fever and cough.
He said that he and his family were in good health and would be in self-isolation “for as long as it is deemed medically necessary.”
Rachel Matthews: The actress, who was the voice of Honeymaren in “Frozen II,” said on Instagram on March 16 that she had tested positive and had been in quarantine for the previous week. She said her symptoms began with a sore throat and fatigue on the first day to shortness of breath and loss of appetite afterward.
Kristofer Hivju: The “Games of Thrones” actor said in an Instagram post on March 16 that he had tested positive for the virus and that he, along with his family, was in isolation. “We are in good health — I only have mild symptoms of a cold,” said Mr. Hivju, 41. He urged people to take precautions and to distance themselves from others. “Together we can fight this virus and avert a crisis at our hospitals,” he said.
Olga Kurylenko: The actress, perhaps best known for her role in the 2008 James Bond film “Quantum of Solace” and the “Magic City” television series, said on Instagram on March 15 that she had tested positive. “Fever and fatigue are my main symptoms,” she wrote.

Both lawmakers fell ill after voting on the House floor on March 13. In separate statements, Mr. Diaz-Balart said that he was feeling much better, and Mr. McAdams said he would continue to work from home.
Soon after, Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 Republican, and Representative Drew Ferguson, his top deputy, said they would self-quarantine.
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.

The Coronavirus Outbreak
The Coronavirus: What Scientists Have Learned So Far
A respiratory virus that originated in China has infected more than 100,000 people and has begun to spread in the U.S.
An intensive care unit treating coronavirus patients in a hospital in Wuhan, China, the virus’s epicenter.
A novel respiratory virus that originated in Wuhan, China, last December has spread to six continents. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, at least 20,000 people have died and the spread of the coronavirus was called a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March.
Much remains unknown about the virus, including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections, and whether they can transmit the virus. The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know.
Here’s what scientists have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak.
What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling a crown or the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract.
At least four types of coronaviruses cause very mild infections every year, like the common cold. Most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives.
Another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 caused a more dangerous condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The virus was contained after it had sickened 8,098 people and killed 774.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.
The new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19.
It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus. It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu. The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study. But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season.
About 5 percent of the patients who were hospitalized in China had critical illnesses.
Children seem less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus, while middle-aged and older adults are disproportionately infected.
Men are more likely to die from an infection compared to women, possibly because they produce weaker immune responses and have higher rates of tobacco consumption, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, which may increase the risk of complications following an infection.
“This is a pattern we’ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract — men can have worse outcomes,” said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
How is the new coronavirus transmitted?
Experts believe that an infected animal may have first transmitted the virus to humans at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds in Wuhan. The market was later shut down and disinfected, making it nearly impossible to investigate which animal may have been the exact origin.  
Bats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, and they were found to be the starting point for SARS. It is also possible that bats transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal, such as pangolins, which are consumed as a delicacy in parts of China, and may have then passed on the virus to humans.
Latest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak

C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat.
The outbreak grew because of human-to-human transmission.
People infected with the virus produce tiny respiratory droplets when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, allowing the virus to travel through the air.
Most respiratory droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. People who are in close contact with those infected, particularly family members and health care workers, may catch the virus this way.
Scientists don’t know how long the new coronavirus can live on surfaces, and preliminary research suggests that hot and humid environments may not slow down the pathogen’s spread. Warm weather does tend to inhibit influenza and milder coronaviruses.
Infected people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even if they have few obvious symptoms, a study in Germany has found. That’s “bad news,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.
When people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,” he said. Still, a report by the World Health Organization suggests that asymptomatic cases are rare.
Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak
The virus has infected more than 678,900 people in at least 171 countries.
What symptoms should I look out for?
Symptoms of this infection include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. But milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.
Patients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. Current estimates suggest that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after being exposed to the virus.
If you have a fever or a cough and recently visited China, South Korea, Italy or another place with a known coronavirus outbreak, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so the office can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure.
Is there a test for the virus? What is the treatment?
There is a diagnostic test that can determine if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities.

In early February, the C.D.C. sent diagnostic test kits to 200 state laboratories, but some of the kits were flawed and recalled. Now other laboratories are making their own tests. Other countries are using test kits manufactured locally or sent out by the W.H.O.
The C.D.C. announced that anyone who wanted to be tested could, if a doctor approves the request. Private companies, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, are also rushing to provide tests at various labs across the country, but the supply has yet to meet public demand. Many patients complain that they still cannot get tested.
Once a coronavirus infection is confirmed, the treatment is mainly supportive,  making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, managing his or her fever and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
Patients with mild cases are told to rest and drink plenty of fluids “while the immune system does its job and heals itself,” she said. Most people with mild infections recover in about two weeks. More than half of those who have been infected globally have already  recovered.
A number of drugs are currently being tested as potential treatments, including  an antiviral medication called remdesivir, which appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. The National Institutes of Health is testing the drug on infected patient in a clinical trial in Nebraska. The drug’s maker, Gilead, has also begun trials at various sites in Asia.
How long will it take to develop a vaccine?
A coronavirus vaccine is still months away — and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to act quickly, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.
After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.)
By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.
Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial might get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine was safe and effective.
The best thing you can do to avoid getting infected is to follow the same general guidelines that experts recommend during flu season, because the coronavirus spreads in much the same way. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance — at least six feet — from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
The risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States “is way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.
But, he added, “if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.”
Older adults and people with chronic medical conditions should also consider postponing travel anywhere, particularly by air, federal officials warned.
Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness. Thailand and Malaysia have turned away yet another cruise ship, this one carrying a large number of Italians.
Airlines and cruise lines have canceled service to destinations affected by the outbreak, with others, including United Airlines, cutting back on domestic service and international service.
Is it too late to contain the virus?
W.H.O. officials have credited lockdown measures China imposed in late January for averting the spread of more cases from Wuhan. China sealed off cities, shut down businesses and schools, and ordered residents to remain in their homes. Officials use cellphone data to track and intercept those who have been to Hubei Province.
In recent weeks, government workers have gone door-to-door to round up people who are infected, placing them in stadiums and other buildings that have been converted to makeshift hospitals. Now, official reports suggest that new cases in China are waning.
But there is growing fear that containment may no longer be possible.
Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said the surge of cases in multiple countries was “concerning because we know the transmissions are spreading at a fast rate.”
“We’ve learned some things of this new virus for the past couple of weeks that make it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,” he added.
There is benefit to delaying its spread as long as possible. Containing the virus may buy health officials more time to stock hospitals with test kits and respirators, and for local governments, companies and schools to enact strategies — telecommuting and online classes, for instance — that may reduce the spread.
But the ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend largely on the strength of their health systems, capacity to conduct tests and effectiveness in communicating updates to the public.
“We have been dealing with flu for decades, and even now it seems some countries don’t even have a policy for influenza preparedness,” said Leo Poon, head of the University of Hong Kong’s public health laboratory sciences division. “Not to mention something which is new to them. That’s a problem.”
The Coronavirus Outbreak
How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.
Is there a vaccine yet?
No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.
Governor Andrew Cuomo paid a pre-announced visit to NYC on Saturday and says he was shocked to see New Yorkers gathering in close proximity in the city's parks, playing basketball, shopping in open-air markets, and generally behaving as if the city was not in the grips of a deadly pandemic.
"I was in NYC yesterday, it was a pretty day. There is a density level in New York City that is wholly inappropriate," Cuomo told reporters at a Sunday press conference about the latest COVID-19 news. "You would think there is nothing going on in New York City. You would think it's just a bright sunny Saturday. I don't know what I'm saying that people don't get...This is not life as usual. I was in these parks and you would not know there is anything going on. This is just a mistake! A mistake! It's insensitive! It's arrogant! It's self-destructive! It's disrespectful to other people! It has to stop and it has to stop now! This is not a joke and I am not kidding!"
A group of people sit in close proximity on the grass in Washington Square Park in NYC against the advice from officials and health experts. SCOTT LYNCH / GOTHAMIST
Cuomo said he spoke with Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson and ordered them to come up with "an immediate plan to address this situation" in NYC parks. Cuomo wants to review a plan within 24 hours, saying, "There are many options. You have much less traffic in NYC [due to the COVID-19 response]. Get creative. Open streets to reduce the density. That's where people should be — in open space areas, not in dense locations."
Cuomo said he saw kids playing basketball on Saturday, and argued that there is "no concept of social distancing while playing basketball. It doesn't exist. You cannot stay six feet away from another person playing basketball. You can, but then you're a lousy basketball player and you're gonna lose." He said it's still okay to go for a run or a walk. ("God bless you.")
On Saturday, City Councilmember Mark Levine, who chairs the City Council health committee, announced that team sports are no longer allowed in NYC Parks, but there was no indication the order was enforced on Saturday.
NEW: Due to the imperative of social distancing, team sports are no longer allowed in NYC Parks (basketball, soccer, etc.)
Parks Department spokesperson Crystal Howard said late last week that parks workers "are cleaning our facilities following the directions and recommendations from DOHMH, including cleaning with appropriate products to ensure that surfaces are being fully disinfected." But playgrounds and exercise equipment areas remained open for use, and the Parks Department confirmed that workers are not regularly cleaning outdoor furniture or play equipment.
Statewide measures to keep all non-essential workers home go into effect tonight as part of Cuomo's "New York on PAUSE" order. The state's social distancing effort urges people to stay at least six feet apart in attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can remain transmissible on surfaces for days, depending on the material. In Washington Square Park, one clever good Samaritan drew circles on the ground to illustrate the safe distances recommended by health experts.
Shoutout to whomever drew these (perfect) circles 6 feet apart in Washington Square Park. THIS is what social distancing looks like. If NYC can do it so can you.
"The City has already banned team sports and revoked all permits for large gatherings and has increased the presence of NYPD and Parks Enforcement Patrol officers to enforce social distancing," Meyer said in an emailed statement. "We are evaluating these efforts and considering expanded restrictions. The Mayor and the Governor have already discussed these efforts and we will continue to coordinate with the State. We urge every New Yorker to heed these new restrictions immediately."

Zimbabwe reports first coronavirus case
A health worker wears a protective suit during a demonstration of preparations for any coronavirus cases at a hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe, on March 5 2020.
Zimbabwe on Friday reported its first coronavirus case, a man who returned to his home in the tourist resort town of Victoria Falls from Britain at the weekend.
"This is the first case of Covid-19 in Zimbabwe," said Health Minister Obadiah Moyo on state television ZTV.
The Zimbabwean government on Tuesday announced a raft of steps to prevent the virus from spreading - including the cancellation of public and sporting events, and constraints on gatherings. Schools will close on Tuesday.
The country's public health system, meanwhile, has been suffering for years from a lack of equipment and drugs.
It came under further strain last year when hundreds of junior doctors at state hospitals staged a three-month strike over conditions and pay - which then was less than $200 a month.

Press Briefing by Members of the President’s Coronavirus Task Force
HEALTHCARE
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  I’m Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Chairman of the President’s Task Force on the Novel Coronavirus.
I’m going to start by turning things over to Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to discuss the current situation on the novel coronavirus.  Dr. Redfield.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Let me give you an update on the current situation of the novel coronavirus.  First though, I want to emphasize that this is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize that the risk to the American public currently is low.  Our goal is do all we can do to keep it that way.
As of today, there are nearly 9,700 cases in China, with more than 200 deaths.  Additionally, currently there are another 23 countries that have confirmed, totally, 132 cases.  This also includes 12 individuals who have been confirmed in six countries who did not travel to China.
CDC has launched an aggressive public health response focused on early case recognition, isolation of those cases identified, and contact tracing around those individuals.  This response is a layered response, which includes both targeted airport screening, as well as heightened education and awareness of the American healthcare community to be vigilant in ascertaining the possibility of recent travel to China when they are evaluating patients with upper respiratory tract infection.
To date, we have confirmed six cases of this novel virus in the United States.  The most recent case had no travel history to China, but was a close personal contact of one of the previous cases that we had identified through our aggressive contact tracing.  In addition, there are currently 191 individuals that are under investigation.
Once again, I want to emphasize that this is a significant global situation, and it continues to evolve.  But I also want to emphasize again that the risk at this time to the American public is low.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you, Dr. Redfield.  I would now like to invite Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, to discuss the underlying rationale for the actions that I will be discussing after he concludes.  Dr. Fauci.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  The concept that’s underlying the action that you’ll hear about shortly is the issue of the unknown aspects of this particular outbreak.  So let me enumerate just a few of these.
I can start off by putting it into perspective by telling you I often get asked — we have an influenza outbreak here.  We have about 8,000 deaths already.  We have about 100,000 hospitalizations.  Why are we paying such attention?  And why are we doing the kinds of things we’re doing here right now?
Well, the reason is, despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there’s a certainty, for example, of seasonal flu.  I can tell you all, guaranteed, that as we get into March and April, the flu cases are going to go down.  You could predict pretty accurately what the range of the mortality is and the hospitalizations, as we’ve done over the years.
The issue now with this is that there’s a lot of unknowns. As you can see just from the media, the number of cases have steeply inclined each and every day.  You know that, in the beginning, we were not sure if there were asymptomatic infection, which would make it a much broader outbreak than what we’re seeing.  Now we know for sure that there are.
It was not clear whether an asymptomatic person could transmit it to someone while they were asymptomatic.  Now we know from a recent report from Germany that that is absolutely the case.
There are a number of countries outside of China that have travel-related cases.  And now what we’re seeing is that there are secondary cases from them, and, as Bob mentioned, we also have that in this country.  The WHO has issued, as you know, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern declaration.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.  Today, President Trump took decisive action to minimize the risk of the spread of novel coronavirus in the United States.  Since taking office, President Trump has been clear: His top priority is the safety of the American people.  In addition to the steps that the doctors have outlined, we continue to operationalize a multi-layered, cross-agency, public health response.
Following the World Health Organization’s decision to declare the 2019 novel coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States.  The actions we have taken and continue to take complement — complement the work of China and the World Health Organization to contain the outbreak within China.
In accordance with the declaration, beginning at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time; Sunday, February the 2nd, the United States government will implement temporary measures to increase our abilities to detect and contain the coronavirus proactively and aggressively.  Any U.S. citizen returning to the United States who has been in Hubei Province in the previous 14 days will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine to ensure they are they are provided proper medical care and health screening.
Any U.S. citizen returning to the United States who has been in the rest of Mainland China within the previous 14 days will undergo proactive entry health screening at a select number of ports of entry and up to 14 days of monitored self-quarantine to ensure they’ve not contracted the virus and do not pose a public health risk.
Additionally, the President has signed a presidential proclamation, using his authority pursuant to Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, temporarily suspending the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Once again, these actions will become effective at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time; Sunday, February 2nd.  These prudent, targeted, and temporary actions will decrease the pressure on public health officials screening incoming travelers, expedite the processing of U.S. citizens and permanent residents returning from China, and ensure resources are focused on the health and safety of the American people.
The United States appreciates China’s efforts and coordination with public health officials across the globe, and continues to encourage the highest levels of transparency.
It is likely that we will continue to see more cases in the United States in the coming days and weeks, including some limited person-to-person transmission.  The American public can be assured the full weight of the U.S. government is working to safeguard the health and safety of the American people.
DEPUTY SECRETARY BEIGUN:  Good afternoon.  And thank you, Secretary Azar.  My name is Steve Biegun, and I am the Deputy Secretary of State, and I represent the State Department on the President’s Novel Coronavirus Task Force.
In this particular case, this includes identifying any health or safety risks to which they may be subjected, but also, very importantly, identifying their access to essential services such as healthcare in parts of China that are affected by this coronavirus.
China has an excellent healthcare system, but, in parts of the country, it is simply overwhelmed and the accessibility to that healthcare for any reason — including potential infection, but also any other type of accident in need of medical care — may be compromised during the Chinese government’s own treatment of the consequences of this virus.
Let me also say and echo what Secretary Azar said, which is we are deeply appreciative of the close cooperation we have with the Chinese government as we work together to try to find appropriate ways to address any risks and challenges from this virus.
And finally, the United States will continue to cooperate with China in ways that we could potentially provide assistance, including technical assistance, and also, to the extent possible, any critical supplies that the Chinese need in order to address this virus.  And we are working very hard to find donors and make arrangements so that we can — we can undertake a robust effort to help the Chinese people get their arms around this outbreak.
Several elements of the Department of Homeland Security are engaged in implementing the medical strategy you heard described here, including Customs and Border Protection, which stands at our land ports, seaports, and airports — and I’ll come back to the airports in a moment — particularly the Office of Field Operations personnel who you see when you come back into the country from your travels.  They’re the first line of defense when you land and come to the country.
Additionally engaged is TSA — the security and the engagement with the airlines.  Our chief medical officer in the department is in CWMD and they’re — we were providing medical support at the airports.
So we’re using contract authority that we have to backfill the CDC personnel, so they can be freed up for other missions at the airports where medical screening is being focused.
The President’s proclamation will have Customs and Border Protection ensuring that United States citizens, legal permanent residents, and their immediate families continue to enter the United States, though they — those coming from Hubei Province, as you heard from the Secretary, will be subject to quarantine and the others from China to screening.
This is done under CBP’s authority.  It will be executed by the Secretary the Department of Homeland Security, consistent with the President’s proclamation and in support of that effort — again, so we can focus the expertise of the medical professionals that will do the screening to implement this.
We’ll continue to support the medical efforts across the country both at our ports — our land, sea, and air — as well as with personnel standing up some of the resiliency measures that HHS has been working on for some time.  Thank you.
Q    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  If the risk is really low, could you talk about why go to such an extreme as a public health emergency?  If the risk is that low, why are we taking such measures?
This just helps us focus our efforts so that we — as we’re dealing with the unknowns that Dr. Fauci spoke about earlier — unknowns around incubation period, unknowns about the speed of transmissibility, unknowns about asymptomatic transmission, unknowns about severity — that we take appropriate, measured, prudential steps so we can focus our resources.  Because it’s the bread and butter — I’ve talked to you before about — the bread and butter of public health is: identify people who might be symptomatic or might have the disease, diagnose, isolate, treat, contact trace.
Q    Mr. Secretary, the mandatory quarantine for people coming in Hubei Province — will that be home quarantine or will that be in an institutional setting?
SECRETARY AZAR:  That would be at an appropriate quarantine facility of some kind for those individuals.  For the U.S. citizens returning to the United States from having been in China within the previous 14 days, they would be funneled, as Secretary Cuccinelli spoke of; they would be screened appropriately to see if they present any type of symptoms of the disease; and then they would be asked to self-isolate at home over the 14 days.
But for individuals from Hubei — because that is the epicenter of this, with such high immediate transmission — we feel that these additional measures of quarantine for up to 14 days are appropriate.
Q    And can I just follow that: Have you selected specific quarantine centers?
Q    To follow up on John, what does self-quarantine look like for the people who are self-quarantining?  How do you enforce that?  What are the mechanisms surrounding that?
And if you could you also speak to — you just described this as sort of an incremental step, I believe.  This is obviously significant: the quarantine of citizens in this country.
What is your message to Americans who are watching this on the news, who are seeing this, who are feeling really alarmed by the steps that this administration is taking and by the spread of coronavirus in general?  They hear you say the risk is low, but then they see this action being taken, and I think some people might be freaked out by that.
SECRETARY AZAR:  I hope not.  I hope that people will see that their government is taking responsible steps to protect them.  These are — these are preventive steps.  The risk is low in the United States.  The risk is low of transmissibility, the risk of contracting the disease is low, but our job is to keep that risk low, as much as we can, by taking appropriate preventative steps.
Let me ask Dr. Redfield if he can talk a bit about — we — this is — we do this type of quarantine and self-isolation work basically every day, working very closely — I want to stress something that we’ve not mentioned enough — working very closely with our state and local public health partners.  They’re — just as we do with emergency response, we serve as a backup and expertise and a border-type force, but the state and local authorities are the backbone of our public health infrastructure and we work with them to daily to help with our quarantine stations and activities.
So, Dr. Redfield, could you talk a bit about self-isolation?
Then, there’s a large category of individuals coming back to China.  As we stand here today, over half of the reported cases in China now are not in Hubei, but when you look at their history it’s — they got infected — probably over 80, 85 percent of them got infected from Hubei.
Those individuals will then be actively screened when they come into one of the seven airports, for significant risk, as well as any evidence of any symptoms.  In the absence of any reason to advance them into a clinical evaluation at that port of entry, they will be allowed to complete their travel back to their home, where they then will be monitored by the local health departments in a self-monitoring situation their home.
We did this in the West Africa Ebola outbreak.
She had no symptoms at the time.  She went back to China and got sick.  This individual, with whom she had an interaction, contracted the coronavirus at a time that she had no symptoms.  He then transmitted it to two of his colleagues, so they now have four cases.  One of the problems with when the virus is transmitted in an asymptomatic way and has its implications — it puts a terrible burden on the screening process.  How do you screen somebody?
You know, remember back with Ebola?  Ebola doesn’t get transmitted unless you’re actively very ill, and you know that. It’s very, very clear.  When you can transmit a virus at a time when you’re asymptomatic, that just puts that extra burden on screening.  And as a lot of people come in, it’s going to be very difficult.
Q    Dr. Fauci, can I follow up on that?  I — just what he was just saying.  Given that Germany data that you just cited, are the 195 people being quarantined right now — are they getting tested every day for coronavirus?
DR. REDFIELD:  Clearly, they’re all isolated and will be for the 14 days.  We have done virus isolation, but I want to be clear: The current tests that we developed at CDC is not — we’re not sure of the natural history of how the virus is isolated.  Can you isolate it one day, then three days later you can’t?  And we are seeing — in the cases that are in the hospital, we’ve seen people who had detectable virus, then they didn’t have detectable virus, and then three days later they had detectable virus.
We’re using the virus cultures right now in these individuals more to help us learn about this virus.  How much asymptomatic carriage, in fact, is there?  So I want people to understand that distinction.  We’re not using it as a release criteria because we don’t know the natural history of how this virus is secreted, and this is what we’re continuing to learn.
Q    And are you comfortable that the thousands of people that pass through the U.S. screening so far are not car- — that  they don’t have coronavirus?
DR. REDFIELD:  So this is why it’s such a layered approach.  We are going to see additional cases in this country.  We’ve already seen, in the six cases we’ve defined: A number of them came in asymptomatic.  So this is why we have that multi-layered approach and have really worked hard to engage the medical community in the United States.
Of the six cases that we diagnosed so far, one was picked up by hospi- — airport screening.  Four were picked up by astute doctors.  And the most recent one was picked up by CDC doing aggressive contact tracing.
Q    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Jeff Mason from Reuters.  Can you — you referenced airlines earlier.  Can you or your colleague from the Department of Transportation give us an update on the administration’s thinking about a travel ban on airlines, in general, being prohibitive for flying to and from China?
ASSISTANT SECRETARY SZABAT:  There is no travel ban — Joel Szabat, Assistant Secretary of Department of Transportation.  I think many of you who’ve been following this are aware: All of the three U.S. carriers who’ve flying between the U.S. and China have announced that they are taking down all of their passenger flights, and they announced that before any action by the administration.
Q    Dr. Fauci, how confident are you in the accuracy of these tests?  If somebody is testing negative and then they later test positive, can you have confidence, if you’re testing negative for something, that you don’t have it?
I want to get back to that broad concept that I mentioned when I made my brief introduction about the unknowns.  We don’t know the accuracy of this test.  We haven’t done enough — people who came in with negative, then all sudden they were positive.  You could have virus in your nasal secretions or you couldn’t and still be infected.  I mean, it isn’t like it’s a horrible test, but it is not a test that’s absolute.
I spoke to a reporter the other day, talking about tests.  So when you’re talking about HIV, if a person has HIV and I draw their blood, I can tell you 100 percent whether they have HIV or not — 100 percent.  That’s not even near where we are with this.
But we have public health tools that we use, we exercise constantly in the event of larger-scale infectious disease outbreaks.  And that’s what we would — that what we would rely on should we end up seeing more cases in the United States.  But it’s exactly these measures that help make any additional cases more manageable to use the tools Dr. Kadlec will talk about.
DR. KADLEC:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  And my role in this is really precautionary at this stage.  And everything that’s been done at this point has been incremental, proportionate, and precautionary.  And so my responsibilities are to work across the federal government, as well as within HHS, to ensure that we’re postured should this virus, kind of, continue to expand.
And so, domestically, we’re working on — working with our private sector healthcare preparedness.  We’re working specifically around supply chain resilience because much of our healthcare products come from overseas.  And we’re also working actively with NIH and our DOD colleagues, as well as our DARPA colleagues and the private industry to develop better diagnostics, possible therapeutics, as well as vaccines, which Dr. Fauci can speak more about.
SECRETARY AZAR:  So let me ask Dr. Redfield if he could talk a bit about — just giving your assessment as a health professional about international travel generally.  And then the types of factors — maybe for Dr. Fauci — that we’ll be looking at as we, again, temp- — hopefully, temporary measures, titrated, try to just keep a pause on the situation.
And, as the Secretary said, these precautionary messages and actions that have been put out today, it really is intended to keep this virus from causing significant consequences to the American public.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you all very much.  And again, I just want to stress: First, the most important thing that we can be doing is what we are doing, which is offering to help the Chinese government and assist them in helping them to control the spread of the novel coronavirus in China — working with them as closely as possible, as well as with the World Health Organization.
Second, the risk to Americans is low.  You have a team here.  You have an experienced, first-class — the world’s best public healthcare system, infrastructure, and professionals looking out for you, making judgments like this, scaling them up, as appropriate, to work to keep this from becoming an issue that would be of concern for you — to keep that risk low.

This Is What The COVID-19 Virus Looks Like Under The Microscope
Having caused an extensive health scare and over 1,000 deaths so far, the COVID-19 virus (also unofficially known as 2019-nCoV) has received wide media coverage since its discovery in December last year.
But although microbiologists around the world have been using the virus to try and develop a vaccine, many of us non-scientists haven't actually seen what this new coronavirus looks like.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' (NIAID) Rocky Mountains Laboratories (RML) have just released scanning and transmission electron microscope images of the coronavirus, and they're... surprisingly aesthetically pleasing.
What you're seeing above is a scanning electron microscope image in false colour, showing the COVID-19 virus from a patient in the US; the viral particles are coloured yellow as it emerges from the surface of a cell, which is coloured blue and pink.
The image above was captured with a transmission electron microscope. This isn't quite as sharp as the first one, but you can see the spikes on the surface of the virus (which gives the coronavirus its name, meaning 'crown').
If these look a little familiar, it's because most coronaviruses – such as SARS and MERS - look similar on the outside, sharing the bump-covered spherical appearance.
Viruses in the coronavirus family only have small differences in their genome, with only five nucleotide differences between three of the viruses. Nevertheless, the viruses can have notably different presentations when it comes to infecting humans.
The images you see here were the result of collaborative teamwork. RML investigator Emmie de Wit provided the virus, microscopist Elizabeth Fischer produced the images, with the visual medical arts office colourising the images.

White House coronavirus task force defends Trump's NY quarantine proposal
The first person to test positive for coronavirus in New York City is a health-care worker who acted in a “textbook way” to try to avoid contaminating others after arriving from Iran with her husband, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday.
The woman took a car service when she and her husband, also a health-care worker, arrived Tuesday, he said.
Her husband also is under self-quarantine and is being tested for the illness, “but we’re assuming that he’s positive, given the circumstances,” so he’s undergoing the same protocol as his wife, the governor said, adding that the testing was done at Mount Sinai Hospital, he added.
“The health-care worker has manifested some respiratory illnesses but her condition is mild, so she’s at home,” he said.
  “In general, there is no doubt that there will be more cases where we find people who test positive. We said early on it wasn’t a question of if but when. This is New York, we’re a gateway to the world. … The whole challenge is about containment of the number of people who become exposed and who become infected,” Cuomo said.
“You’re not going to eliminate the spread but you can limit the spread. Testing is very important and that’s why the CDC, the federal government’s now allowing us to test is a very big deal,” he continued. “We want to get the testing capacity as high as possible. I would like to have a goal of 1,000 tests-per- day capacity.”
The Empire State has received the go-ahead from the feds to perform its own coronavirus testing, noted Cuomo, adding that emergency legislation is in the works to authorize $40 million for extra staff and equipment.
“We should relax because that’s what is dictated by the situation. I understand the anxiety, but the facts back it here,” he said, adding that “we think we have the best health-care system on the planet.”
“I want to ensure I tell the people of New York what I tell my daughter: In this situation, the facts defeat fear because the reality is reassuring. It is deep-breath time. First of all, this is not our first rodeo with this type of situation in New York. … When you look at the reality here, about 80 percent of the people with the coronavirus self-resolve.”
In his remarks, de Blasio said that “so far it does not seem to be a disease that focuses on our kids, in fact the opposite. … In fact, the facts are reassuring.
City Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said that “because of the fact that this New Yorker took early action, and there’s no easy indication that it’s easy to transmit by casual contact, there’s no need to do any special anything in the community.
“We don’t think we have the best health-care system, we know we do,” he said, chuckling.

Teen Who Died of Covid-19 Was Denied Treatment Because He Didn't Have Health Insurance
COVID-19
A 17-year-old boy in Los Angeles County who became the first teen believed to have died from complications with covid-19 in the U.S. was denied treatment at an urgent care clinic because he didn’t have health insurance, according to R. Rex Parris, the mayor of Lancaster, California. Roughly 27.5 million Americans—8.5 percent of the population—don’t have health insurance based on the latest government figures.
“He didn’t have insurance, so they did not treat him,” Parris said in a video posted to YouTube. The staff at the urgent care facility told the teen to try the emergency room at Antelope Valley (AV) Hospital, a public hospital in the area, according to the mayor.
“En route to AV Hospital, he went into cardiac arrest, when he got to AV hospital they were able to revive him and keep him alive for about six hours,” Parris said. “But by the time he got there, it was too late.”
The name of the urgent care clinic that refused to treat the teen has not been released. Mayor Parris explained in his YouTube video that the 17-year-old is believed to have had no underlying conditions that may have contributed to his death.
“He had been sick for a few days, he had no previous health conditions. On the Friday before he died, he was healthy, he was socializing with his friends,” the mayor explained.
Los Angeles County currently has 1,216 covid-19 cases and 21 deaths, according to the L.A. County Public Health Department’s website. The U.S. as a whole has identified at least 85,991 covid-19 cases and 1,296 deaths as of Friday morning, according to the Johns Hopkins online coronavirus tracker. The U.S. became the country with the highest number of confirmed cases of the virus in the world yesterday, surpassing China and Italy.
The Lancaster teen tested positive for covid-19, but the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is reportedly evaluating the case to see if there’s another explanation for his death. The initial cause of death was explained on Tuesday as septic shock from complications with covid-19. The teen’s father has tested positive for covid-19 as well. The teen’s death has been removed from the official U.S. death toll, according to Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer, who gave a press conference on March 25.
Countries with authoritarian leaders like China, Iran, and Russia have adopted a strategy of denying that some people have actually died from covid-19, even after they test positive for the disease. In Russia, for example a 79-year-old woman in Moscow recently died of the new coronavirus, but the Russian government said that while she may have tested positive, she actually died of pneumonia. Moscow saw a 37 percent surge of “pneumonia” cases in January over the previous year, according to ABC News.
There have also been allegations from health care workers in the U.S. that some covid-19 deaths aren’t being properly counted, even as hospitals become overwhelmed with patients, sometimes waiting hours to get tested.
“We just don’t know. The numbers are grossly underreported. I know for a fact that we’ve had three deaths in one county where only one is listed on the website,” one unnamed nurse in California told BuzzFeed News this week.

The covid-19 pandemic has changed the world, grinding to a halt increasingly large geographic areas
People are already dying in New York emergency rooms waiting for ICU beds, according to the New York Times. President Donald Trump has denied that there’s a ventilator shortage, a dangerous lie. Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News last night that he doesn’t like hearing “complaints” from governors and that states don’t actually need more ventilators, contradicting overwhelming evidence that hospitals across the U.S. will need thousands more ventilators in the coming weeks.
“I think that a lot of things are being said that are more [than needed],” Trump said of the medical equipment being asked for by governors. “I don’t think certain things will materialize. A lot of equipment’s being asked for that I don’t think they’ll need.”
Meanwhile, Los Angeles County is preparing for an influx of patients like they’re seeing in other U.S. hotspots like New York, Washington, and Louisiana. The Los Angeles Convention Center is currently being converted into a quarantine center according to local CBS TV affiliate KCAL-9. And the city of Lancaster is setting up makeshift triage centers, as evidenced by the number of cots in Mayor Parris’s own video on YouTube.
“We’re gonna get through this, and we’re going to be a much stronger community when we do get through this. We’re going to see things in each other we never dreamed possible. It’s not going to be terrible when it’s over, but we have a ways to go,” Parris said, urging people to take the covid-19 pandemic seriously.

Elon Musk wants to make a big contribution to the coronavirus fight.
Last Wednesday (March 18), the SpaceX and Tesla chief offered to start manufacturing ventilators for coronavirus patients if need be. Medical practitioners and politicians urged him to do so, stressing that many hospitals around the country will have a shortage of breathing machines as the pandemic progresses.
Related: Live updates about the coronavirus pandemic
"Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!" Musk said in a tweet on Saturday (March 21). (Medtronic builds and sells a variety of medical devices.)
Musk is helping hospitals deal with the outbreak in other ways as well. Over the weekend, he told CleanTechnica that his companies will soon start distributing 250,000 N95 masks, critically needed medical respirators that help keep doctors and nurses safe during the outbreak.
Some of this protective gear has already hit the road, making its way to UCLA Health Hospital in Los Angeles and the Seattle home of a doctor at the University of Washington Medical Center who's researching the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, which is known as COVID-19.
Musk is also offering advice about the outbreak via Twitter. For instance, he has stressed repeatedly that panic about COVID-19 could end up being worse than the disease itself.

It is safe to say that there is as much virus in the US as there is in China now. Goods are flowing into the US from China and all over the world. Stopping the international flow of material would be devastating to the economy of all nations.

Coronavirus
A coronavirus is a common type of virus that usually causes mild illnesses, but can lead to more serious infections
Electron micrograph of Coronavirus, the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that usually cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold. However, certain types of coronavirus can infect the lower airway, causing serious illnesses like pneumonia or bronchitis. Most people get infected with coronaviruses at some point in their lives and the majority of these infections are harmless. The new coronavirus that causes the covid-19 illness is a notable exception.
Coronaviruses have extraordinarily large single-stranded RNA genomes – approximately 26,000 to 32,000 bases or RNA “letters” in length. Coronavirus particles are surrounded by a fatty outer layer called an envelope and usually appear spherical, as seen under an electron microscope, with a crown or “corona” of club-shaped spikes on their surface.
Covid-19
The virus that causes covid-19 is known as SARS-CoV-2. It appears to have first emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The outbreak has since spread across China to other countries around the world. By the end of January, the
The most commonly reported symptoms include a fever, dry cough and tiredness, and in mild cases people may get just a runny nose or a sore throat. In the most severe cases, people with the virus can develop difficulty breathing, and may ultimately experience organ failure. Some cases are fatal.
Coronaviruses replicate their RNA genomes using enzymes called RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which are prone to errors, but genomic analysis so far suggests that covid-19 is mutating slowly, reducing the chance of it changing to become more deadly.
There are currently no vaccines or specific drug treatments for coronaviruses, but efforts to develop a vaccine are underway and HIV and Ebola drugs are being tested in people with covid-19.
On 18 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) said they had begun a trial of the most promising drugs, including the long-used antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a new antiviral drug called remdesivir and a combination of two HIV drugs called lopinavir and ritonavir. The HIV drugs will also be tested in combination with an antiviral called interferon beta.
Many other potential treatments are being explored, particularly the possibility of developing antibodies against covid-19.
Other severe coronaviruses
At least two other types of human coronavirus – Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) – are known to cause severe symptoms.
SARS-CoV first emerged in 2002in Guangdong, China as an unusual pneumonia, which developed into life-threatening respiratory failure in certain cases. The virus rapidly spread across 29 countries, infecting more than 8000 people and killing about 800.
The MERS-CoV epidemic appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012, with people experiencing similar symptoms to SARS-CoV but dying at a much higher rate of 34 per cent. Unlike SARS-CoV, which spread quickly and widely, MERS-CoV has been mainly limited to the Middle East.
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning that they can be transmitted to people from animals. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originally came from bats, though other animals – including camels in the case of MERS – can act as intermediaries that spread coronaviruses to humans.
Many of the early  cases of covid-19 were traced back to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan.  The virus is thought to have come from bats, possibly via an intermediary animal.

Does a high viral load or infectious dose make covid-19 worse?
HEALTH 27 March 2020
An illustration of coronavirus particles
Does being exposed to more coronavirus particles mean you will develop a more severe illness? Rumours circulating on social media suggest that hospital workers or their household members exposed to a higher “viral load” become sicker than the general population. But emerging research indicates the relationship between infection and covid-19 severity may be more complex – and differ from that of other respiratory illnesses.
The average number of viral particles needed to establish an infection is known as the infectious dose. We don’t know what this is for covid-19 yet, but given how rapidly the disease is spreading, it is likely to be relatively low – in the region of a few hundred or thousand particles, says Willem van Schaik at the University of Birmingham, UK.
Viral load, on the other hand, relates to the number of viral particles being carried by an infected individual and shed into their environment. “The viral load is a measure of how bright the fire is burning in an individual, whereas the infectious dose is the spark that gets that fire going,” says Edward Parker at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Read more: You could be spreading the coronavirus without realising you’ve got it
If you have a high viral load, you are more likely to infect other people, because you may be shedding more virus particles. However, in the case of covid-19, it doesn’t necessarily follow that a higher viral load will lead to more severe symptoms.
For instance, health workers investigating the covid-19 outbreak in the Lombardy region of Italy looked at more than 5,000 infected people and found no difference in viral load between those with symptoms and those without. They reached this conclusion after tracing people who had been in contact with someone known to be infected with the coronavirus and testing them to see if they were also infected.
Similarly, when doctors at the Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital in China took repeated throat swabs from 94 covid-19 patients, starting on the day they became ill and finishing when they cleared the virus, they found no obvious difference in viral load between milder cases and those who developed more severe symptoms.
Although it is difficult to draw firm conclusions at this stage, such studies “may impact our assumptions about whether a high number of viral particles predisposes to a more serious disease”, says van Schaik.
Read more: We’re beginning to understand the biology of the covid-19 virus
However, a study of patients hospitalised with covid-19 in Nanchang, China, found a strong association between disease severity and the amount of virus present in the nose. “Those with more severe disease had a higher level of virus replication, although we have no evidence to relay the initial exposure dose to disease outcome,” says Leo Poon at Hong Kong University, who was involved in the study. “That rumour is still an open question to me.”
It is early days, but if the infectious dose doesn’t correlate with the severity of disease symptoms, this would mark covid-19 out as different from influenza, MERS and SARS.
For influenza, a higher infectious dose has been associated with worse symptoms. It has been tested by exposing volunteers to escalating doses of influenza virus in a controlled setting and carefully monitoring them over several weeks. This hasn’t been done with covid-19, and is unlikely to happen, given its severity.
Read more: How soon will we have a coronavirus vaccine? The race against covid-19
Animals infected with higher doses of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses also experienced worse outcomes, says van Schaik. “I think we just have to conclude that while this virus is related to SARS, there are also important differences that are currently poorly understood,” he says.
Even if the infectious dose isn’t related to disease severity, it still pays to try and minimise our exposure to the virus because this will reduce our chances of falling ill in the first place. “We want to be taking every precaution we can to prevent ourselves getting infected, which will also reduce our ability to pass the virus on to others,” says Parker. “Any measures we can take to avoid infection are worth taking.”

Japanese flu drug 'clearly effective' in treating coronavirus, says China
Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage
Medical authorities in China have said a drug used in Japan to treat new strains of influenza appeared to be effective in coronavirus patients, Japanese media said on Wednesday.
Patients who were given the medicine in Shenzhen turned negative for the virus after a median of four days after becoming positive, compared with a median of 11 days for those who were not treated with the drug, public broadcaster NHK said.
Coronavirus: the week explained - our expert correspondents put a week’s worth developments in context in one email newsletter
Doctors in Japan are using the same drug in clinical studies on coronavirus patients with mild to moderate symptoms, hoping it will prevent the virus from multiplying in patients.
But a Japanese health ministry source suggested the drug was not as effective in people with more severe symptoms. “We’ve given Avigan to 70 to 80 people, but it doesn’t seem to work that well when the virus has already multiplied,” the source told the Mainichi Shimbun.
The same limitations had been identified in studies involving coronavirus patients using a combination of the HIV antiretrovirals lopinavir and ritonavir, the source added.
In 2016, the Japanese government supplied favipiravir as an emergency aid to counter the Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea.
Favipiravir would need government approval for full-scale use on Covid-19 patients, since it was originally intended to treat flu.
A health official told the Mainichi the drug could be approved as early as May. “But if the results of clinical research are delayed, approval could also be delayed.”

'Come back Monday, OK?' Hundreds of prisoners escape in Brazil amid Covid-19 anger
Holiday for minimum security prisoners is cancelled because of outbreak, so many simply run off
Hundreds of prisoners have escaped from four semi-open prisons in São Paulo state in the south-east of Brazil after Easter prison holidays were cancelled and restrictions on visitors tightened because of coronavirus.
The São Paulo state penitentiary department said it had postponed the Easter prison break – one of five annual breaks for prisoners in semi-open regimeswho work in the day – because of coronavirus. “The measure was necessary because the benefit would include more than 34,000 convicts of the semi-open regime who, returning to prison, would have high potential to install and propagate coronavirus,” said a statement, adding that semi-open prisons did not have armed guards.

Other security specialists said anger over the treatment of leaders of Brazil’s biggest drug gang, the São Paulo-based First Capital Command (PCC), was also a factor. Some prisoners have complained over the treatment of PCC leaders, refusing to go to hearings in what is called a “white strike”, said Renato Lima, director-president of the Brazilian Public Security Forum. Others were angry over restrictions on visitors showing signs of colds or suspected of carrying coronavirus.
But coronavirus posed a new threat, Lima said. In 2017 a third of Brazil’s prisoners, 234,000 people, did not have a health station in their prisons and nearly 9,000 prisoners were over 60. “It’s a timebomb,” Lima said.

A newborn baby has tested positive for coronavirus in what is thought to be the youngest case of the disease in the UK, it has emerged.
The child’s mother, who was taken to a north London hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia, has also caught the virus.
The mother tested positive at North Middlesex hospital, in Enfield, with results coming through after the birth. The baby was tested for Covid-19 minutes after being born.
Coronavirus may force UK doctors to decide who they’ll save
The NHS trust confirmed that two patients tested positive for coronavirus, with staff in close contact with them during treatment now being advised to self-isolate.
It is not known whether the child contracted the disease in the womb or was infected during birth. The Sun, which first revealed the case, reported that the baby was still being treated at the hospital but the mother has been transferred to a specialist infections hospital.
In a statement, North Middlesex university hospital NHS trust said: “Two patients at North Middlesex university hospital have tested positive for coronavirus. One has been transferred to a specialist centre and one is being treated in an isolation room.
“The safety of our patients and staff is our top priority, so in following guidance from Public Health England, we are regularly deep cleaning the areas where the patients are cared for and staff who were in close contact with these patients were advised to self-isolate.”
Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, has said previously that pregnant women should not start worrying about coronavirus. The government says there is no clinical evidence so far to indicate that the virus can be transmitted via breast milk.

The Armani Group said it has turned its production lines to produce single-use smocks for healthcare workers in Italy. Armani said on Thursday it has already shifted its focus and converted all its Italian productions sites to meet needs arising from the Covid-19 crisis, reports Lorenzo Tondo.
Italian health workers are running out of medical equipment and hospitals are dealing with a severe shortage of protective medical gear, including face masks and hazmat suits.
Armani has already donated €1.25m to Italy’s Civil Protection and several Italian hospitals.
The Armani Group is just the latest big-name fashion brand to turn its production lines to meet needs arising from the outbreak.
As previously reported by my colleague Ellie Violet Bramley, on Tuesday, Prada said it would produce 110,000 masks by 6 April, while Gucci has said it will make more than 1m. Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga will also begin manufacturing them. During the weekend, H&M Group said it would be rearranging its supply chain to produce protective equipment for hospitals and healthcare workers.
Belgium government warns pets at risk after cat diagnosed with coronavirus
The Belgian government has advised people to wash their hands before touching their pets after a cat was diagnosed as having contracting the coronavirus from its owner, in an apparent world first, writes Daniel Boffey in Brussels.
During a daily press conference by scientists working with the federal government, virologist Steven Van Gucht, said the infection appeared to be an isolated case and that the animal’s health is now improving.
He said: “A week after the owner developed symptoms, the animal also developed symptoms,” said virologist Steven Van Gucht. “It was diarrhoea, vomiting and breathing difficulties. The researchers found the virus in the cat’s faees. Two dogs were previously reported to have been infected in Hong Kong but neither of those animals had symptoms.
Van Gucht said: “There are no indications that this is common. It is also important to note that it was a transfer from human to animal and not from animal to human. The virus does not normally pass from animal to human. We therefore consider the risk to people to be small. ”
If an owner becomes infected with the coronavirus, they are are requested to keep the animal inside and to keep contact between owner and animal to a minimum.
The National Council for Animal Protection (CNPA) said the development should not be a cause of alarm. “Animals are not vectors of the epidemic, so there is no reason to abandon your animal,” the organisation said in a statement.
Israel’s military has said it will send about 500 soldiers to join police officers in enforcing a nationwide lockdown, writes the Guardian’s Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem.

A group of doctors have set up a crowdfunder to get vital protective equipment to medics who are dealing with coronavirus cases, amid concerns that trusts are struggling to protect frontline workers because of a lack of supplies, writes my colleague Sarah Marsh.
Dr Mona Barzin and Dr Salaj Masand among others published a page online that reads: “We are a group of colleagues (doctors in hospitals and GP), who have set up this initiative to source PPE [personal protective equipment] for those who need it most in our fight against coronavirus.
“Unfortunately current hospital supplies are not sufficient and while we are reassured the government is doing everything it can, healthcare workers on the frontline are risking themselves daily without adequate protection to care for sick patients. Healthcare workers on the frontline without PPE is the equivalent of going to war without armour and protection.”
The page explains that PPE involves face masks, visors, surgical gowns and gloves. The group said it has procured details of a number of internationally reputable suppliers of PPE, including those cross referenced by the UK embassy.
They are trying to raise money to buy the equipment directly from global supply chains and donate supplies directly to the NHS Hospitals in need.
NHS England and the government have made a significant effort since the weekend to address concerns about protective gear. The army has been called in to help deliver millions of pieces of PPE and 200 hospitals were due to receive extra kit overnight on Tuesday.
The British prime minister has tested positive for coronavirus
The British prime minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is exhibiting “mild symptoms”.

Leaders of Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre, revered as the site of Jesus’s crucifixion and burial, urged worshippers on Saturday to maintain social distancing to help fight the coronavirus.

“The Holy Sepulchre is the ultimate place of hope. Hope that faith will defeat doubt, light will defeat darkness and life will triumph over death,” it added.
With the usually busy Easter holiday approaching, the coronavirus crisis has led to a sharp decline in the number of visitors to the Holy Land. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a particular favourite among pilgrims and tourists.
Israel has reported 883 confirmed cases of coronavirus to date and one death.
Alejandro Giammattei, the president of Guatemala, has ordered an eight-day curfew from Sunday to stem the spread of coronavirus in the Central American country.
My colleague Helena Smith has this update on the coronavirus response in Albania:
Albania has resorted to deploying the army to enforce a curfew that began at 1pm local time on Saturday – the country’s latest bid to stem the spread of coronavirus.
The measure, set to last 40 hours, was implemented after citizens continued to openly flout orders to stay at home. To date 76 people in the former Stalinist state have contracted the virus. Two deaths have also been recorded.
With some 120,000 people having returned from Italy – like Greece, host to a large Albanian community – prior to the country cutting air and sea links with its neighbour on 9 March, there are mounting fears over the ability of the nation’s health system to cope in the event of a sudden surge in confirmed coronavirus cases.
Prior to the lockdown, Albanians had failed to uphold the appeals of authorities to social distance with news agencies in Tirana, the capital, describing joggers going out in groups to exercise, the elderly playing dominoes in the street and people converging on supermarkets with scant attention to those next to them.
First coronavirus death in Bosnia
A woman has became the first to die of the coronavirus in Bosnia, the manager of a hospital in the north-western town of Bihać said on Saturday.
“The first victim is an elderly woman who died in the hospital even before her test for coronavirus showed positive. She had a history of chronic diseases,” Hajrudin Havic said.
Bosnia has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus outbreak.
Algeria said on Saturday that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had risen to 139 from 95.
The country has stopped international and domestic travel, closed mosques, cafes and restaurants and told half of state employees to stay at home to try to limit the spread of the virus.
Turkey imposed a partial curfew on Saturday for citizens over the age of 65 and those with chronic diseases, effective as of midnight, as part of measures against the coronavirus outbreak.
Wales coronavirus death toll rises to five
A further two people have died in Wales after contracting coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths there to five, health officials have said.

It is with sadness I report that a further two people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died.
This takes the number of deaths in Wales to five.
The patients were a 75-year-old, who died at Singleton hospital, and a 98-year-old, who died at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd.
Both patients had underlying health conditions.

The emergency legislation came into effect at 23:59 GMT on Tuesday.
Chief Minister Howard Quayle said anyone breaching the quarantine regulations could face a fine up to 10,000 or three months in jail.

Coronavirus is currently having a serious impact on the ambulance service.

At a time when most people are distancing themselves from others, ambulance crews are doing what they always do: going into the homes of sick and vulnerable strangers to offer help.

Even at their most effective - and draconian - containment strategies have only slowed the spread of the respiratory disease Covid-19. With the World Health Organization finally declaring a pandemic, all eyes have turned to the prospect of a vaccine, because only a vaccine can prevent people from getting sick.
By the way, where have all the anti-vaxxers gone? Has anybody heard of them lately? Are they okay? Are they in self-isolation? They are strangely quiet, which is not their usual behaviour... I'm worried about them, please reassure me.

The Federal Reserve's Coronavirus Crisis Actions, Explained (Part 1)
The Federal Reserve has taken an extraordinary amount of actions over the past two weeks (most of which have happened over the course of 8 days from March 15th to March 23rd) to calm financial markets and sustain the flow of credit to households and businesses to respond to the coming Coronavirus-induced depression. By my count, they’ve made 15 significant announcements which are directly related to fighting the crisis breaking out (including 2 yesterday). In this respect, their response has been far superior to the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 where they announced programs slowly and hesitantly, reversed themselves periodically and generally resisted strong responses for fear of causing a panic themselves. They have clearly learned the lesson that it builds far more confidence to respond aggressively and early than to extend and pretend.
Settlement balances are created when the Federal Reserve spends or lends them to another entity. They are the main form of money that the Federal Reserve creates and are at the center of how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy. Because the Federal Reserve has an interest rate target and a commitment to preserve the stability of the payments system, it must supply settlement balances at its target interest rate in order for payments to settle. It can adjust its interest rate target, but it still must supply settlement balances at some price. The demand for settlement balances is generally determined by the need to settle payments today and the desired buffer of settlement balances by banks to clear payments in the future. That desired buffer can be influenced by a number of factors, but the main factors that determine it are generally the liquidity requirements that banks are subject to. Historically those were “reserve” requirements, which required banks to hold settlement balances in proportion to their average level of liabilities over the past two week period. Since 2008 there have been major new liquidity requirements introduced by the international regulatory working group the “Basel Committee on Banking Supervision” which is headquartered in Switzerland. 
It is suspected (though still not completely confirmed) that “Repo Madness” last September (where interest rates on overnight borrowing secured by treasury securities surged) was a result of this bank examiner preference. What’s key here to understand in the context of Coronavirus is that there have been lingering concerns about liquidity in the U.S. banking system and the Federal Reserve’s ability to conduct monetary policy quickly and effectively given these liquidity requirements so whatever the Federal Reserve’s response would be, they would be very concerned about eliminating any of these concerns during the crisis itself.
The first major announcement from the Federal Reserve related to Coronavirus arrived March 9th. This announcement is standard for “natural disasters”. It simply loosens restrictions on banks and requires waiving certain fees for customers so that they can sustain flows of payment services and credit to affected areas. In other words, as of a little over 2 weeks ago the Federal Reserve was not yet treating this as a systematic (let alone global) financial crisis. We don’t get another announcement from the Federal Reserve related to Coronavirus until almost a week later on March 15th
Two days later, we got a flurry of Federal Reserve announcements. In the morning we got a joint announcement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that essentially says regulators are easing up on banks in order to encourage them to continue to lend to households and businesses.This statement in large part is confirming that other bank regulators are on board with the Federal Reserve’s march 9th statement. However, there are important new details. One is that they are explicitly encouraging banks to use their “capital and liquidity buffers”. That is, regulations for the past decade have encouraged banks to greatly increase the high quality liquid assets they hold and to increase their capital levels. Essentially, they are trying to implement the suite of financial regulations that we have countercyclically. 
With the second announcement, we’re officially back in crisis. What marks financial crises the most is the alphabet soup of facilities announced by central banks. The first facility to return is the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). In the 2008 crisis, this facility was announced on October 7th, 2008. It is also the first action taken using emergency 13(3) powers, which requires approval by the Treasury Secretary. These powers were reformed by Dodd-Frank because of what was perceived as overreach by the Federal Reserve. One of the biggest restrictions Dodd-Frank included was that the programs the Federal Reserve sets up must be “broad-based” and not be bailouts of specific entities.  It will be an ongoing debate for years whether the Fed’s actions are legal and if they are, whether 13(3) powers need to be reduced further.
That all said, what this specific facility does is finance this SPV so that the SPV can in turn purchase commercial paper (essentially resellable short term IOUs of corporations) directly from corporations. The problem is that corporations have been having increasing trouble borrowing as financial markets freeze up as a result of coronavirus. This can affect their ability to make payroll and meet other important financial obligations. In other words, it's unacceptable to let the commercial paper market go down.
This is the first facility announced which is larger in scope and different from any facility created during the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, though it is very similar to the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility announced September 19th 2008. Again invoking 13(3) emergency, the Federal Reserve will lend to any chartered U.S. bank, any Broker-Dealer which is owned by a bank holding company or U.S. branches of foreign banks which concurrently with using the facility purchases eligible assets from a Money Market Mutual Fund. Those assets are in turn pledged as collateral for those loans. What is also important about these loans is they are “no-recourse loans”. That means that all the Federal Reserve can do in case of default is seize the collateral, they can’t demand any more payment from the users of the facility. In other words, the participants bear basically no credit risk in participating in the program and the Federal Reserve is effectively purchasing these assets.
Last, but certainly not least, last friday the Federal Reserve announced that it was expanding the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to purchases of state and municipal debt with a maturity of 1 year or less. This is important because state and local governments are bearing the burden of increases in healthcare spending right at the time their tax revenues are falling off a cliff and municipal interest rates are rising. Still, the facility is of limited help because it is limited to maturities of 1 year or less. I hope to write more about the state and municipal debt situation next week.
This brings us up to date as of last week. We still have this week’s domestic Federal Reserve actions to go through and I will be using part 3 of this series Friday to go through the Federal Reserve’s responses to the international liquidity situation. Already this has been a flurry of rule changes to understand. I’d summarize it this way- They began their true crisis actions by lowering interest rates, trying to guarantee liquidity to treasury markets as best they could and making unlimited direct borrowing for banks available and as destigmatized as possible. They then did what they could to ease the constraint capital requirements put on supporting lending to households and businesses. Quickly afterwards they followed through with a set of facilities to direct credit directly to non-financial corporations. That last facility creatively changed capital rules and loan terms to effectively use financial institutions as passthrough entities to purchase government guaranteed securities, short term corporation’s IOUs and short term state & municipal debt from Money Market Mutual Funds. This is already a lot but it is not large enough to deal with the enormity of the credit freeze Coronavirus has created- as their actions this week reflected. See you tomorrow to go through the even larger actions that have been announced this week.
Nathan great piece! Appreciate all your stuff. I did have one question about the MMLF view that it is zero risk for the participating bank. Theoretically, if the cp issuer defaulted on their cp, the bank who bought it and used it as collateral at the Fed could default on their loan to the fed and stick the Fed with the bad collateral with no further recourse. So theoretically, no credit risk. But in practice I can’t imagine any bank who is still able to pay back the fed doing this. I would think it more likely they would pay back the Fed, be delivered back their bad collateral, and eat the loss - meaning in practice they will still wear the credit risk. Or alternatively, the risk of being put in that position sours them on using the facility altogether. Am I thinking about this wrong or do you think healthy banks will voluntarily default to the fed and leave them with bad collateral in the event of a cp default?
